{"4rMxRpNKXqA": "well good morning you guys in this video i wanted to uh show you a lighter that you may not be aware exists and i basically consider these a survival lighter and there's many reasons why and these are a good lighter to keep in your bug out bag or survival pack and to have several of them and have them in different locations so you always have access to one because these uh lighters are very unique and they offer features that the bic lighter here does not i mentioned in a previous video how the bic lighter isn't necessarily the best survival fire starting tool because it has a tendency not to work um when it's below 31 degrees fahrenheit and if you get the flint and flint wheel wet it won't ignite and it's not refillable now if you look at the clipper lighter versus the bic lighter they're almost the same size the bic lighter is just a just a hair taller but it's not refillable the clipper lighters are refillable with butane and what i like about the clipper lighter is that if it gets wet you can easily dry this out over a bic lighter because if you just pull on the wheel [Music] the flint wheel and the flint stick pull out and if you unscrew the bottom of the stem and pull it out there's a spring in here that holds the the flint up against the flint wheel you can unscrew this and pull it out and change the flint like a zippo and it will actually hold a second flint below the first flint so you can store an extra flint inside of this tube and what's nice about it is that being that it pulls out of the lighter casing is that now you can focus on just drying this part by blowing on it and then putting it back in the lighter whereas you can't do that with a bic but the beauty about this clipper lighter is that you can get a fire going with just using the flint wheel to get a fire tinder to burn if you've got dry tinder down here and you spark into it you can light your tinder without even using the lighter so that's why these are a good survival lighter i've never seen these at any department store or drugstore or anywhere else where they sell lighters i've never found these in stores and i'll leave a link below where you can get all six of these for one price and it says that it comes in six different colors however i want to make a correction on that because there are not six colors here the only colors you have are yellow green red and blue clear where you can see the fluid inside of it which makes it nice so you can see what level it's at is not a color white is not a color nor is black black and white are not colors and i just wanted to include this in the video because a lot of people do not know this when someone has a black card and they say hey what color is your card i say well it's black well black's not a color nor is white it's a shade it's why you didn't have colored tvs back when televisions were black and white after black and white then colored tvs came along because black and white is not a color you can google this and look it up on the internet if you go to art school or an art college and you say to your instructor hey i'm going to color this in black they would yell at you black and white is not a color it's a shade white is a shade and black is a shade so these do not come in six colors you've got a shade you've got clear and you've got four colors i just wanted to correct that any artist out there like myself that has done art all their life know that black and white are not colors they're shades but these make great survival lighters you guys because by being able to pull out the flint and being able to change it and store an extra one in there as well as being able to get a fire going just using the the flint stick which is now like a flint match even if the lighter is out of fluid you can still get a fire going some people have been able to get a fire going even just using the spark from a dead um lighter such as the bic but being that you're able to take the flint out of this and use it directly down in your fire tinder and get it closer and throw a much bigger spark these make the ultimate survival lighter so the clipper lighters have three options that the bic does not you can refill it you can change the flint and you can pull the flint pin out and be able to use it to get a fire going that's why these make an excellent survival lighter i hope this helps you guys i'll leave the link for them down below you get all six for one price with free shipping thanks for watching we'll see you again bye bye", "mQpJ22eHey0": "hello everyone inventor seven one nine here and in today's video I am going to be showing you a awesome lighter hack to increase the flame on one of these types of lighters from something like so to this let's get started now for this project all you will need is this specific type of lighter and a small tip screwdriver used for prying stuff open the most important step is to get the right type of lighter and so you need something just like this red one on the left and generally these do not have name brands mine here says Canada light but it could be different for yours and the key is that it has this adjustable knob right here so that's the one that you will need now other lighters do have the adjustable knob like this one here called X light and it does still work pretty good not as good as the other one but if it has the knob it will work this will not work with bic lighter x' as you can see there's no adjustable thing in bic line is just suck so don't buy one of these ones so the first step here is to remove this metal casing at the top and to do that you're going to use your prying utensil I have a small screwdriver here and sticking it in there prying it open you can also stick it in here somewhere and the key is it only remove this metal casing make sure not to remove the wheel as it is almost impossible to put back in so as you can see I've removed the metal casing and this is what it looks like right here that just popped right off and so now to adjust the flame this is the adjuster right here and on the markings underneath sorry they aren't there on the metal thing you can see positive is by turning this counterclockwise so what we're going to do is turn it as far as you can counterclockwise and then as you can see here it just engages those gears so lift up the black ring to disengage off the white gears push over to the left so we are not moving the white spindle push down again to re-engage and open up over down open so I'm going to do that about four times and then we're done the modification and for an additional step you can replace the metal cover for safety or looks so there's the final modification before and after and since it might not look any different now let me take it to a dark room to show you guys the real difference here we are this is the pre modified lighter and this is the one we modified a little bit so let's compare not bad nice and it doesn't go in on its own sometimes so you got to give it a little shake once more comparison hard lay them both at once and there you have it pretty cool modification before and after so I hope you enjoyed the video learn how to do this nice easy modification key is to get the right lighter and follow the steps I showed you and be careful as if you open it too much there is the chance of it going back down the - and exploding in the lighter so be very careful and do it somewhere where if it does explode and won't burn your house down so I'm not responsible but I said my part so anyway thanks for watching as always please like comment and subscribe help me reach the hundred thousand hey guys hope you enjoyed the video do me a favor and click that big red subscribe button right there and also check out some of my other videos by clicking the links on the screen here's for all my real fans who made it past the end car in the video nice little bonus video for you guys got four modified lighters here and let's do this yeah hope you enjoy", "Po84rXBDwKI": "ok today we're going to talk about the latest masterpiece butane lighter by Blink and it is a masterpiece it is by far one of the coolest layers that they've ever made this is called the blink tsunami the lighter has four Jets and the cool thing about it is when you do light the lighter the four Jets you know they sort of come together and they sort of make like a written you know they make like a red point and it's just very cool very cool it's a bit of a gas guzzler but I say well worth it mo they're not they're hard to find most smoke shops and things don't carry blink products because they're too expensive most people don't want to pay for them like this one was like 40 40 40 dollars blink is more known for making you know products like this you know high-end torches you know I mean a lot of people go for these things that you can get at like 7-eleven you know with you know this cheesy nozzle you know compared to you know this nozzle I mean you know you get what you pay for you can pick one of these up for like four bucks I mean but you know refilling it is a pipe dream I mean if you tried to refill this lighter you probably break it so that said you know I I think they're worth the price you know they're they make a few lighters but you know mostly torches so we got some Bronson butane fuel which a lot of people on YouTube I notice say this is not you know this isn't an inadequate fuel but I disagree I think I think this stuff is as good as anything I think but I've been buying it for years so let's talk about how to properly refill this it's not completely empty but if it was completely empty what you want to do is purge the nozzle and completely empty it if the lighter is say half full and you want to just top it up you know it's still good to just you know hit it for a few seconds and let it let any excess air out that's built up in it and now the best way to refill these lighters is to do three-second reps so what you do is you put it in one two three four and then come off of it one two three four and come off of it you know do this about seven times one two three four and then come off of it I've noticed that's the best way to do it you get the best results so yeah that's the blink tsunami very very very cool light and there there is a little window here where you can see how much fuel is in it so yeah so that's that that's that the one thing is I mean with all butane lighters with when you do refill it you want to let it sit for a little while give it 10 minutes to because the gas that you put in it is so cold you know you want to let the gas you know adjust to the ambient temperature of the lighter which is probably you know the the ambient temperature of the room you know let the gas give the gas a chance to you know warm up to ambient temperature and you'll you'll get better results it'll work like the day you bought it so that is the blink tsunami awesome lighter hard to find there's only a couple websites that sell it but as far as blink lighters go this is the masterpiece at the moment", "JS3EHdOVXKU": "what's up guys welcome back to unbox junkie my name is Matt and today we're looking at something a little bit different I saw this on Amazon and I thought hey that's kind of cool let me check it out so today we're looking at the hahaha the Huawei Wow it's an electronic cigarette lighter watch it's a watch with a lighter built into it I'm kind of excited for this because I've like have never seen one of those it looks really cool a lot of this is in I believe Chinese I can definitely tell you from reading the Amazon page it's USB charged I believe it can hold a full charge for up to hours and I don't know if that means continue with used for two hours or what I have no idea but let's just open it BAM oh and it's a good looking watch look at that it's not a bad looking watch pull this bad boy out nice presentation wah wah wee while we out wheel I don't know I'm just insulting them now small micro USB cable that's always good that's everything there's no instructions or anything in the box I believe let's see the system starts working when the LED light turns lit during the usage if the single device time is longer than 15 seconds the system will stop power transmission automatically and the LED light becomes flashing the LED light will blink successfully in case of undervolt voltage which means that you need to charge it when charging the LED light will turn lit and it will become dark when the batteries are fully recharged okay cool so real simple then continuous fast play three unlock I don't know that I mean let's just look at it I've got weight to it oh man look at that I got to say it's actually a pretty decent looking watch now I thought this was going to be some sort of leather but it is definitely not leather it's rubber like rubber is all get-out keep in mind probably it's just a novelty item if you want to use this for long term use and you want this to be like your regular watch you're probably going to want to change that band out because boy look at that that is okay so on the side you can see you got the micro USB cable and I'm guessing that little dot right there is going to be the LED indicator you've got nothing on this side of course you've got the the watch setting twister knob Deeley I don't know I don't know the exact term for that I don't know what that's made out of I think this is plated with like a chrome painting and then on the back they've got their name so I both oh you just move it over oh it's alright what okay hold on wait a minute you just move it over and there it is it just turns on 15 seconds let's see what happens boom it just turns off look at that that's crazy that's actually that's actually kind of cool I'm kind of digging that okay well okay I'm gonna have to try this on nothing on it is warm that was my first thought is all God is this thing going to get hot and burn my wrist but no it's not I won't say the rubber is a not ideal it doesn't feel that great it's just a little odd having a watch that's super rubbery so there we go there it is that's actually that's that's not bad right flip it open boom we need to test this out so I stopped by the store and I picked up one of these little guys it's a cigar not like you know the real deal type of cigars on a real man's cigar but it is a black and milds it's a little tiny thing and then I got a little ashtray just in case so wow that's strong you might be thinking hey I don't smoke I'm not interested in this but what is okay what if you're just out sure you don't smoke but what if that pretty little lady or that handsome guy comes up to you it's like hey do you have a lighter you could be like you know what I do Sam not only is that awesome because nobody really ever sees anything like that but it's going to bring them even closer to you because then you got to go come here right there not to be too creepy or anything let's just try it out here I'm going to try it it is lit well I gotta say it worked it really did work that's that's not bad I mean it didn't get a full burn going let me see if I can Oh burn the ice Oh smoking is not cool kids if you're watching that smoking is not cool but what is cool is having a lighter watch because who wouldn't be impressed by that okay put that off to the side it's burning my eyes all right if you're going to get this I highly suggest changing out the band for sure if it's like any other watch it shouldn't be too difficult and you can get bands pretty much anywhere even if you're not a smoker it's not a bad idea to just you know what be ready for someone or maybe you're you see that person across the way and they're like oh man I don't have my lighter excuse me excuse me Bob if that doesn't get you a number I don't know what will maybe charm and good looks but you don't need that when you've got one of these I'm going to leave a link down in the description below go check it out I mean when you see the price tag you're probably going to be like that it's not bad it's not a bad idea I want to just light more stuff up now light all kinds of stuff", "mmRu4_zbs2o": "hey everybody welcome back now sometimes being prepped isn't about all the exciting topics like stocking food guns ammo first aid all that stuff sometimes it's about some basic stuff today we're covering one of those topics with a brand new company that was just brought to my attention these are new letters from the mk lighter company [Music] all right everybody welcome back now i know you're asking yourself he's doing a video on lighters it's a good sunday video anyway folks i think it's survival of some preppers we tend to overlook the most basic stuff you know one of them is the value of a good lighter we have our flint and steel our fellow rods our matches that will burn for a month underwater but still in this day the most basic simple thing to get a fire started is a good old lighter and with this company you got so many choices at affordable prices you can buy them in bulk so they're really good for your prepper stockpile and they have refillable both gas and flint so they can be changed out instead of buying more lighters you have a solution right there ready to go so a good example are these new little mk lighters here these guys here these are the grip pro pocket lighters as you see on the bottom that can be changed the flint can be changed out of it they're just a basic lighter what i like about these is they have this grippy texture on them this is this new slip guard texture and it's almost like it's rubberized but it's not and that's all these different colors up in here okay you got these two same thing turn it up you get the same thing these are refillable and reflintable and you have something that i would carry in a bug out bag without any questions at all this guy right here now he's off at the moment click them on and you get a jet that is an amazing way to start a fire even with wet tinder this will dry your tinder out and it will work very very well definitely a cool little thing if you're looking for something a little bigger you have this one here same idea these little jet lighters are awesome they're windproof very very handy very very cool and they are refillable as well as you can tell on the bottom there so that's what i'm really liking about these now these are just regular lighters as well just a different shape a little bit different these are the piezoelectric jet they have an electric on the bottom they're all refillable this gives you the size of a dick lighter yet a directable flame these are kind of cool i'm going to cut them open and we're going to try it out because i haven't tested these yet now i want you guys to know they did send me these for review and i have been using them as a matter of fact i think a video or two ago you probably saw me use either that one or that one to light a stove i have been using them i really like them um there's that one right there okay i have been carrying this blue one right here just a plain old basic lighter i forgot i didn't turn it all the way up but i'll be darned i had you know i even tried my tip to fill it and it filled up nicely it was full when i got it now there is one nice special one in here that's this guy here and this brass lighter here does the same thing again refillable reflintable and it is a jet lighter so i'm assuming there's not a flint in it but it is refillable that is really cool oh that's what that is that's for your plus or minus if you want it to go higher or lower and it is refillable as well that's a nice looking lighter nice little case um nice little presentation case i got to say that's a neat little thing but if these lighters don't tickle your fancy and do it for you there's even more down here you've got all these different lighters for trying to reach over distance this is also handy when you're lighting something that might kind of woof up on you let's see i haven't used this one yet let's unlock it turn it up there you go so that's just a standard flame you have your jet one here i have to remember which way is lock and unlock on them though i kind of forgot now this one's neat because it folds up that makes for a nice handy little package with a nice effective jet on the end of it see definitely really cool thing so these are all refillable as well and this is basically the same thing but it doesn't fold so for your barbecue grills for starting your fires for um just everyday camping you've got such a wide variety of lighters from flint lighters to electric lighters to windproof lighters multi-purpose lighters utility lighters even premium butane letters like that when i showed you the brass one really lots of cool stuff from them and uh they're a california based company they develop modern and reliable layers it's all they do so i wanted to give them a little shout out because i have been testing them out you will see them in my videos more and i'm definitely impressed with them i really do like them i'm going to uh be testing them out every time we have to light a stove or something i really like this one for my uh lightning my surveyor one two three i just can just put it down in there light the bottom put the lid on and i'm good to go and i don't have to get too close but to be honest with you any one of these would work the same way you know just as handy to reach down in there and start a fire so definitely something to think about a lighter is your most basic fire starting tool i understand they can get wet they can get lost they can get broken and that's why you learn and carry an alternative way to start a fire like a ferro rod or a flint and steel but a lot of people overlook lighters when it comes to your emergency preps your bug out bags stuff like that definitely handy to have them and i do like the ones that shut off that's my favorite thing if i can lock that i know that nothing is going to turn that on in my bug out bag or my emergency gear this little guy here especially since it's smaller that is really really cool i can lock it and know that nothing is going to turn that on and when i want it there you go so you're going to see more of these mk lighters in my videos i will put a link down below if you want to learn a little bit more about the company they are on amazon and you can buy them in bulk i'm not going to put them in my store because there's so many different options i just want you to go to their page and look at everything if you want to click my store link and then click their link that's fine but i'm not going to put them in my store because there's so many options you can buy like a hundred of these or 50 of these or 20 of those or five of these you know there's so many options and there's so many different lighters and this is really just a good start so you'll see these in my videos as i try them out and don't forget to check out their link down below as well as our amazon store um i try to put everything that i review in there don't forget to check out our freeze dried wholesalers site down there below you'll get a 15 discount if you're interested in stocking up on some freeze-dried food as

stay safe and stay prepared", "Nzf9wC8Pp1U": "how to fill a lighter i know this sounds like a really simple thing but I know quite a few people who had dificulty filling their butane lighter. So I thought we'd do a quick video and show one method that seems to work very well to get a quick simple fill of a butane lighter. I'm going to be showing us filling our quad torch lighter here and so you can see it's generally empty so first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to turn it upside down and take a pen and I'm going to push right on the little fill stem just for a couple seconds... that lets out a little bit of the air that might be in there as well as lowers the pressure that's inside the tank so that when I now take my can of butane and put it upside down on the lighter and push down and now i'm just going to fill it up. Sometimes it helps to push up and down several times and now when we look at it, we're generally full now now that's the liquids just about to the top   thanks for watching and please leave us a comment on anything that we do and if you have any other thoughts or questions let us know!", "g6WFqPUeAMw": "what's going on guys so today I want to have a quick discussion about disposable lighters and something I learned about the Clipper lighter which you might or might not already know so what kind of maybe you want to do this video is I had a viewer asked me if I wanted this lighter that they had says clipper on here right it's a metal version of this which has been an available since the 70s actually before the 70s and they weren't quite sure if it was real or not and I didn't know that they made any kind of fakes but it turns out that this is not actually a clipper brand this is just a you know counterfeit type lighter it's supposed to mimic this later but in metal but the big difference is that these take butane right all three of these disposable lighters take butane fluid whereas this one is more traditional and you know this thing opens up on the bottom and we have a spot to put regular lighter fluid okay so it'll soak it up kind of like a Zippo lighter or something similar so it was interesting because I was doing some research to find out if this was a real clipper design or not it turns out it is not it is a counterfeit clipper does make a metal version but it's they're minis and they only make it with the butane okay so it has an open top like this and works just like this only it's metal whereas this one like I said is a totally different design so that turned out to be a counterfeit so the whole thing kind of got me thinking about the spoils of the lighters and I wanted to kind of quickly talk about these and compare them as well as tell you what I've learned about the Clipper lighter I feel kind of dumb because I just never knew this but now that I learned it I wanted to spread the news case you didn't know it so first we have the bit lighter right this is the mini bic but it's representing all bic lighters relatively cheap they sell anywhere from 50 cents to a dollar maybe like a dollar 50 you know is a very high price for one if you happen to go to a gas station or something they might be ripping you off and and charge you a little bit more but generally speaking 50 cents to a dollar for a full sized bic or the mini bic we all know them most people use them they run out of fuel we throw away disposable lighter then we have the super cheap disposable lighters this is not even branded most times they're not they come in a variety of different colors they're just super super cheap to buy but they're also unreliable okay I find that Vic's are way more reliable work way more often than lighters like this in fact this one was almost filled with fluid when I got it but there must have been some kind of leak I see a small crack on top here but I didn't use this lighter but somehow the fluid slowly leaked out until it's empty so now it's completely useless and non refillable so they both served their purpose people use them when they're done they throw them out then we have the Clipper lighter now the Clipper lighter I always thought was a disposable lighter but guess what turns out it's not disposable not only can you fill it I don't know why I never really looked at the bottom of these before because I'd use these and I throw them out thinking that they're disposable lighters why cuz they're super cheap these again just like a Bic lighter go anywhere from 50 cents to a dollar maybe a dollar fifty and most more like 50 Cent's when you're buying like you know four packs or more but I always thought they were just cheap plastic disposable layers that is not the case so I'm here to pass on the information that I recently learned not only are these refillable which I should have noticed on the bottom okay so these are refillable with butane fluid but also the wheel lifts up okay so that you can replace the Flint so this is your Flint tube right there's a little screw on the bottom here if you were to unscrew this all the way you can replace the Flint in here as well that's crazy I had no idea that these were reusable because they're so cheap I just made the assumption that they are disposable but they're not so if you happen to like this style of lighter but they also make other shapes as well and they also make a smaller metal one similar to the counterfeit that I showed but it has an open top works exactly the same only it's metal and I think that's like maybe two or three dollars so it's still very affordable now one thing about these clipper lighters they have a distinguishable wheel pattern it's kind of like star shapes okay as opposed to just a standard round wheel what's interesting with this counterfeit is the counterfeit comes with a round wheel however it has the spare clipper style wheel alright I thought that was pretty interesting so what that means is that I can pull this out here I don't want to put this one in here if I preferred the round one instead so it's kind of interchangeable but anyway but yeah did you know that the Clipper lighters were refillable and reusable did you know about the Flint because I didn't so now that I do I want to pass the information on to you so let me know do you guys use bic lighters do use these super super cheap disposable ones or do you use clippers you know a lot of you guys you could tell me off come on Jeff you didn't know that no sometimes you just don't know things until someone tells you I had a viewer tell me this was a couple of years ago but they told me that they loved Zippos but they're just kind of expensive you know once they run out you have to throw them out what what do you mean and he explained to me that yeah you know I keep pulling him up and stuff but eventually that you know the wick it it burns up and then I got to buy a new one and I proceeded to tell them that they can replace that wick they had no idea it was a big forehead slap moment like I can't imagine how many Zippo lighters this particular person bought because they were throwing them out so you know not everything is common sense I mean it's not like you when you go to school they teach you about lighters or anything you know some of these things in life we just have to learn from hearing from others so I just learned about this and I'm telling you so you could pass it on someone else who doesn't know and then more people know but yeah pretty interesting stuff so as much as I love my mini big lighters I will still use these in the case that I have these are just total junk I really don't like these I happen to have a couple of these because they they're kind of like inserts for a butane lighter which we're going to talk about in the future in a future video I'm going to do a review on a large torch so stay tuned for that but honestly for the money these clipper lighters they come in a ton of different designs just like BIC so you can get plane colors and stuff but they have a ton of different you know images and things that can reflect your personality had no idea no idea that they were fillable and reusable supercool so such a cheap reliable lighter that you can reuse unlike the cheap reliable lighter that you throw out buy a new one so just pass it on the info thanks for watching hope you guys have a wonderful day and I will see you tomorrow with another

are known for being self-sustaining self-reliant and not dependent on technology using pretty much low-tech if any for their daily lives one of the big things about the Amish is that they are very devout and they have very strong beliefs and that really makes a very strong and tight community and to me one of the biggest things with the Amish as far as in shtf situation is that they do have that really tight community they're very social in their own circles and they're pretty much you know pretty autonomous in their communities now there are about 250,000 Amish in the United States from what I've found in 28 different states and but one of the things about the Amish is they typically have a lot of children so the Amish community doubles every 20 years and that even includes people that leave the Amish communities and which a lot of people do you know there's it's a very strict code and people really love the conveniences the modern conveniences you know one of the big things about technology to the Amish is that it creates a very lazy kind of atmosphere it makes people you know dependent on other things instead of just really hard work and that's one of the big things about the amish is that hard work is valued I mean that is one of their strict codes and humility and then we're also gonna talk though about to me the biggest liability for the Amish in a survival situation as far as shtf is that they are passive they do not believe in self-defense so we're going to take a look at what the Amish do right and see if we can incorporate some of those things into our preparedness plan now one of the big things that the Amish are very famous for are their buggies and of course most do not believe in cars so they have these buggies and their horse drone and they take them wherever they need to go and of course you know in those areas if you live in an Amish country you've seen the buggies going up and down the roads but they also use bicycles and scooters and I even saw one girl that was using skates inline skates to get around and again it's all low technology these are things that are not powered and you know it goes in line with that hard work ethic but now there are Amish that will hire people to drive them around and especially if they're going on long trips and they're doing things like that some groups allow it some don't but the big thing is guys is when it comes down to learning from the Amish is can any of us really afford to keep a buggy and horses on hand so having alternate sources to be able to get around you know again you know low powered whether it's a bicycle having bicycles keeping them up having maybe some kind of scooter or a buggy I've even seen people a lot of times have bicycles with you know a cart put on the back to be able to take things to and from places it's a lot faster than walking and of course you can carry more it's one of the big things with the Amish is they do produce their own food and they have vast farms it's one of the reasons why the Amish chose Pennsylvania and of course a lot of surrounding areas in Ohio Indiana those areas because they're just really right to have large farms but one of the things about having a farm which is great because you can produce food they use low technologies so they're using horses they're using plows they're using different kind of technology to harvest that's mostly man-made but also they use generators which is kind of interesting diesel generators are allowed now one of the things about the Amish is there are different sects there are different degrees of what they will allow and what a lot of them use and so a lot of these farms have really kind of stepped it up a little bit so they can produce more but they're still very limited in the technology that they use but with diesel fuel they do keep diesel fuel on their farms and things like that to be able to run those generators and so this is one thing is having the equipment if you have a horse and a plow you've got to have the plow not just the horse and you've got to have ways to harvest and to bring that food in and so that's one big thing that the Amish have especially with gardening and farming is that they have the tools and equipment and they don't rely on again modern technology now over the years of course land has gotten very expensive and a lot of people that are from the Amish community really can't afford land and a farm and so a lot of them have gone into industry one of the big ones is furniture making the Amish are really incredible furniture makers they're craftsmen and they make really high-quality furniture using very low technology now a lot of times they do use compressors which would require a generator and they don't have a problem using air compressors at least a lot of the Amish groups and so that really aids them but they still have the know-how and the hand tools to be able to produce furniture in the skill and so that's one thing that's important now is to gain knowledge to be able to produce things that you might need is to look around and think these are some things that I could probably need to know a lot of people have basic woodworking skills and for me I do I love to work with wood I like to make things but I rely very heavily on power tools and so being able to know how to dub cut you know do a dovetail cut and to be able to join things together and use pegs I mean that is a skill that's really lost and it's something that you know we need to consider not that we're in an shtf situation gonna be necessarily making furniture but a lot of times there may be something you need to produce in a survival situation they've also opened up restaurants they do quilting they make mats hats rugs I mean you name it if you can it can be handmade the Amish are making it and creating a business out of it and you know one of the things about shtf which a lot of people have just in their mind that it's going to be the zombie apocalypse that doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to be that way and a lot of times it's just an economic downturn you know crime begins to rise and you know just like it happened in Argentina I mean it wasn't a mass civil unrest it was more of just different things that just life itself began to drop and people had to start really looking for ways very inexpensively to do things and so being able to barter being able to have a skill to make something could really come in handy in an shtf situation because typically things start to kind of level out after a while and people start getting back to a somewhat normalcy even though it may be a lot less than what it was originally and so being able to trade and to barter I mean that's one of the things that mankind has always done even from the beginning and as far as business goes with the Amish a lot of times they have lumber mills sawmills they have gristmills that are run by horses they know how to produce different products once they get the raw materials but the big critical key to this whole thing is that you've got to have the equipment you know there are some small things that we just don't have a lot of times and being able to kind of at least have some of those basics but to be able to produce food and to produce wood and furniture and whatever you need sawmills again you know having a big waterwheel I mean that is a lot and I think that's one of the things that the Amish have going for them is they've got a lot of that stuff already set into place and as just regular people living in day to day lives in modern technology we have not only lost the skill we don't even have the tools to be able to use the skill if we had it knowing where these old mills are around us could possibly be a resource in an shtf situation we can only have three days without water and of course one of the things that the Amish do is they drill wells and they have hand pumps and they can pump the water out and be able to use it not only for you know living and drinking and bathing but also for you know watering the fields and you may live near a water source but that water source may be tainted and you need to make sure that if you're drinking that water that you have a way to purify it and when it comes to power they are very against electricity but they do use a lot of different ways to be able to have power one thing that they do are a lot of the groups do with their homes or kerosene lamps and so they use oil lamps for having lighting in the evening but they also can use propane lamps and so they have in fact I even saw one where they had a big propane tank with a lamp attached to it in their home and so they used those kind of things they also use diesel generators so they keep diesel fuel there and this gives them some sort of electricity here and there but you know cell phones things like that they don't have but they do use cell phones for business and so there are some discrepancies or things or you know variations of what each group does of course wood stoves are a big part gives some heat they can actually cook on it in fact with cooking they use stoves wood-fired stoves which you know I have a good friend of mine that has one just for that purpose and being able though to know how to cook with a wood-fired stove especially in your home coal is one thing that the Amish use solar power they use kerosene and of course kerosene has a lot of different uses for it for kerosene heaters and for lamps they also use batteries and they charge those batteries and then you also would need to have inverters but thinking about things that are none dependent one of the things about a diesel generator is you've got to store up enough diesel fuel same thing with kerosene same thing with coal same thing well I guess wood would be the biggest sustainable way to be able to keep heating cooking and have some kind of power but as far as lamps and having light being able to store up you know kerosene but of course you need to be able to store that safely and so doing a lot of research on really how to do that it's just smart now one of the big liabilities to me as far as shtf for the amish is that they are passive and they don't believe in self defence they believe that thou shalt not kill means that you can't kill someone now one of the big things though also that the Amish have going for them is they're hunters they love to hunt they have their guns and from what I understand a lot of them have a really extensive gun collections they like really quality guns and so but they use them and they teach that those are for hunting and so they provide a lot of their foods hunting and so that's something that you know if they're very accurate with their firearms they're very good with them and they target practice and I'm speaking in general terms but you know that is one thing that the Amish though have is a downside is if they are faced with a violent encounter you know they're not going to be able to defend themselves against their own moral code but there are some that feel that if they have to face a situation with their families that they will defend their family I found it interesting that some business owners actually have concealed carry permits and carry a weapon on them that are Amish if they have a business and so there are some variations and again guys in an shtf situation where things are really going bad you know sometimes people have to make decisions that might go contrary to their core beliefs and so hopefully you know they would at least defend their families and children but one thing I think that would really happen in an shtf situation or the communities that are around the Amish would protect them one of the big reasons is is because the Amish are going to be producing food they're gonna have you know livestock they're gonna have you know vegetables and things like that but they can barter and trade with plus the skills that they have and that needs to be protected because it's gonna benefit the people in the outlying communities as long as the Amish are able to keep producing food even in an shtf situation and so for me if I lived on the outskirts of an Amish community or had Amish neighbors I would be willing to protect them not only because I just want to protect people and care about people but because it would be advantageous to me that that Amish community could continue to produce food that I would be able to get and be able to use and maybe barter and trade with and so I think that a lot of people that live in the Amish country would kind of band together and really protect them and to just like they hire people to drive them around they can hire people to be able to protect them now some Amish will not agree with that just like a lot of times they don't really to cooperate with police when police are looking at crimes against the Amish but I think that a lot of people will step up and protect them and of course there will be areas that will just be wiped out but one of the great things about the Amish is that is real rural and it's out from most of your urban environments and so for people to actually get from there to the Amish could take a long time to do so and so they may be isolated and insulated somewhat and then take the communities around them that are willing to protect them and again guys no one knows what a grid down shtf situation would really pan out to be and like I said community is one of the strongest suits of the Amish people one big thing they do is barn raising they all come together and they'll build a barn and then they'll build another barn and they kind of help each other because that's a really big expense and so they get together as a community they make it a big event it draws people together it makes stronger ties and they're very willing to help one another and you know it's one of the big things about the Amish is they try to stay very humble humble people and you know and there are some bad apples and there are in every culture but one of the things about the Amish community is they're tight and that's really a critical thing to have in survival and so unfortunately today in the world we live in a lot of times you can't trust but you know in the Amish community they built that trust and they built those relationships I think one thing that's important as far as building a group or a community is finding people that are like-minded that have some kind of moral code similar to your own I mean for us our prepper group most of those people either came out of our church or they store they believe pretty much the same way we do and it really builds a strong bond and so we all can agree when things are wrong we can look and say well that's wrong and we kind of all agree that it's wrong sometimes if you get people that are from the outside that come in they may not see your moral code and so they may disagree and that can really cause a lot of problems down the road so having a really strong knit community that you're depending on really is important but sometimes you're thrown together with people and so one of the things that for foul said was when down in Argentina people that really by the best were people that drew together in communities and work together and helped each other and I think that's one of the strongest lessons that we can learn from the Amish is like-minded people joining together making a community and then being better for it and being able to depend on each other because again guys lone wolf is out of there I mean you are not gonna make it long in a lone wolf environment and so having people and depending on people it's just the way we've always been I mean no man is its own island and it's just as important in a survival situation so guys if you're serious about prepping and survival check out survival dispatch insider it is the most comprehensive resource for prepping and survival using some of the top names in the survival world and we upload one video a week that's exclusive to the insider so I'll have a link down below in the description check it out be strong be of good courage god bless america long live the Republic", "1GEPL5xa3IU": "well it's up guys today I'm going to show you how to make a lighter using battery nichrome wire or you could just use an oil spring from a pen that worked okay the first thing you're gonna have to do is you're gonna peel the tape off from the negative sight which is this side right here you're gonna just be the taper on it just pin it off so let's do that so this is what it looks like once you don't pinning the plastic off so now you take you and I chrome wire and grab your pen and just roll it just one time just that so now what you do is grab your battery use the positive side for now grab your nichrome wire set it on top and Bend both side just like that [Music] there now take your bed we flip it on the negative side place the Nikon Y on top just like that make sure the middle part is not taught touching so just like that make sure this is not touching the ball and take some electrical tape and just tape it just like that and you're done that's all there is to it you could you could cut this off if you want to but I'm gonna use it again okay so let me show you how it works this is a match let's pretend this is a garrote so [Music] pretty cool huh if you enjoy watching the video is so far make sure you subscribe so now it's not touching and now it is [Music] see that really hard so what that gap does between the nichrome wire and the battery it's a key spring right every time you touch it it gets really hot then when you stop it just goes back up it's a key spring so let me show you other [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so let's just say you have this kind of battery what did you do it's pretty much the same procedure so now what you want to do let's grab a knife and stick it in between you see there's a call board here just stick it in between that and pry it open not all the way just a little bit see you could actually start a fire just doing that yeah let me show you an example [Music] [Music] [Music] so yeah so but what you could do also is just just pay the whole back off just pry it open yes okay and this should come right off so now this is pretty much like this one [Music] yeah thanks for watching don't forget to subscribe like comment and share and I'll see you guys next time peace", "0G_6zL1zU-Y": "caddis maximus here might as well do a quick review of the ambikada s-- bic lighter these have been around since the 1970s and contrary to popular belief these days these are known as the premium lighters over the cheaper lighters but these were actually sold and as a cheap alternative in the 70s - what lighters were available and what is also interesting is the retail prices around the dollar 50 in the 1970s and that's about the same price as they are today never like these stickers you know try to slowly peel them off you can usually get them apart so these lighters are made in France they're manufactured in the United States and I'm not sure what other countries that they're made in they used to actually ship them back and forth to some of the French made ones will be in the United States and some of the US ones would be put you know elsewhere around the world apparently these are sold in 160 countries we can see that these are if I can get it in just the right light us-made so for a long time they were manually adjusting they just had a gear wheel and for at least a while they were collectible I don't know if they still are and then they invented the automatic adjusting valve which actually worked pretty well and they've been like that for ever since the big deal about the Bick was the 3,000 lights of course the number lights is variable but one deal is BIC does put in a really extra-long Flint the Flint is much longer than the amount of fuel that's put in them as far as the fuel they actually have a special nozzle that fills it up and then it has actually like a nozzle and a little probe inside the nozzle so it fills it up and then it jams a ball-bearing in there so that's why they're not really refillable you can refill them but it's it's kind of some weird hacks but nonetheless that's how they are so besides the sticker they have the child safety which is a spring steel spring that just makes it more difficult to operate the wheel many times I use the lighters for like shrink tubing is they for some reason have made it I mean it's a pretty effective child safety but it's really easy to just pop that little thing out and then it works like a normal lighter these are great to have in a first-aid kit an emergency kit they're a very effective and reliable way to start a fire that's the purpose but they can be used for shrink tubing and even a little tip is if you put the shrink tubing in the orange part of the flame you get this charring but if you put the shrink tube in the blue part of the flame like so you don't get any charring so that's one of these secrets of using a lighter force shrink tubing and it works pretty well so let me go and knock one down just for the heck of it here they're actually pretty easy to take apart I just use a pic here and you just want to get the little steel cover off actually let me zoom in here we are just get this a little cover off it's actually a pretty rigid these big gliders have they're a very strong design with a Center Ridge I believe they're made out of polycarbonate definitely a pretty tough design there's some really cheap lighters that just aren't very safe this one's definitely had quite a bit of use and we'll just go and pop the wheel out even if they seem empty there's always a little bit of gas in there so you have to be careful that will go and drop out the Flint and you can see how long the spring is it is a super duper long spring it's almost 2 inches almost 2 inches long it's pretty surprising and this lighter is nearly empty and there's still quite a big piece of Flint in there of course the thumbwheel is diecast zinc it's actually two-piece there's the solid piece then there's a little pressed on collar this is a wild piece of carbon steel with ridges it's basically like a little file that's wrapped around like a spring they slide that over that cast piece of zinc and then they press on the other side of the wheel so that's how they make the wheel and then what we have left is our valve and our thumb switch let me go ahead and pull those well I can see some of the things even versus the early auto automatically adjusting ones is now the valve is actually just press fit into the plastic so it makes it smaller and you and cheaper and the other thing is there's these two little notches here so when they put on the thumb the valve it actually is crimped around the edge so I suppose it's actually pretty good because it makes it nice and reliable but you can't really disassemble them but we do see that it is a plastic switch but then at least a metal cast zinc lever in there so one of the things that makes them reliable and be able to sustain being dropped anyway I figured I'd do a review of these um bic wouldest bit gliders they have their mini ones and you know some other variations that they have all these different colors and all these that are shrink wrapped it's actually kind of surprising apparently some of the numbers are pretty crazy around thirty-five billion sold obviously a lot less people smoke and do that kind of stuff so a lot less lighters are sold now than they used to be and there's like a Bic lighter app for people who go to concerts because not very many people actually have lighters i doing they may not even allow on the concerts anymore so i think that's a bit hilarious but nonetheless at one point at least they used to sell 5 million plus of these things every single day pretty wild anyway i really appreciate everybody watching and subscribing and if you haven't subscribed please do until next time catice maximus out [Music]", "MM1HmOcBhd8": "hey what's up guys welcome back to the shop just a quick little tip for you today any of you guys used lighters quite a bit for lighting those Marlboros or using it to spark your torch or whatever most of these Bicks like this are disposable not refillable but I'm just gonna show you a quick little way to make it so it is refillable they have a little hole down here in the bottom and it's sealed with a little some sort of bead I guess and what you want to do first is you take a regular standard ordinary pushpin and you want to pop that bead out of there and then I don't know if you can hear this but that's the the bead that's now loose in there which will allow you to fill fill the lighter use any standard lighter butane you can't just put this right on here and fill it so you won't get a good tight seal so what you want to do is find some sort of rubber gasket I have this is actually a foot that's off the bottom of my tabletop belt sander it was already missing one so I just took the other three off and found that it works well but and I think you can actually get these I don't know Lowe's or any hardware store I'm sure but this will just help create a nice tight seal for the butane to fill up so go ahead and start filling and then you're gonna want to do this pretty quickly but soon as you're thinking you got enough in there and it's full you want to take it off and then cover the hole with your thumbs and then take that pushpin that you used earlier and fill that hole make sure it's not leaking now if you use like the standard a little thumbtacks those will probably work better because it'll sit flush or the kind that you don't have the little I don't know hourglass kind of shape you can always just nip that off or sand it down or whatever but I like to be able to take this out and refill it over and over and I find that even you know if you're just keeping it in a tool box or whatever it works well but if you're gonna put this in your pocket or something you may want to sand it flush but anyways there you go now you have a newly refilled Unruh fillable lighter so just a little quick tip for you hope you guys enjoyed it and catch you on the next one", "howFFwmPp4E": "how do you tubers welcome to outdoor survival shop in this video I'm gonna do a comparison on the bic lighter and the dollars for lighter 2 for your dollar so the bic lighter i bought at a convenience store for a dollar 83 and you can get them as low as like 90 cents apiece if you buy them in cases of 50 whereas the dollar store lighter you can get for two for a dollar and you just have to buy two so let's dig in to see just if the bic lighter is actually much better than the dollar store lighter or if you can actually get by with a really cheap lighter like this alrighty so in this comparison I'm going to use a fan two different speeds it's a very small fan it's the key nice I got it off Amazon it's a clip fan I use it in my car and just clip it to the window so I'll be using that in this test today just to provide a little bit of a breeze and to see which one lasts the longest now as for features the pick lighter is pretty traditional all you have you just have the striker and then the button to hold down to let the to let the lighter fluid out the dollar store lighter is very similar same way you strike it and it lights now the dollar store lighter actually has another feature where you can you can take this and adjust the flame height so at full flame height you end up with a really tall flame that's about a 3-inch flame so but in this comparison at least to start out I'm just going to put it about at the level that the pic later is that so alright that's pretty close alright so without further ado let's get this fan on and try these out so we know that both of them light fairly easily without a breeze so I'm gonna start out on the first setting on the dollar store later pic later they're both very similar now turn it up to the high setting so on this test we find out that neither one is very good with any sort of a breeze now let's try turning up the dollar store later all the way see if that makes a difference nope that doesn't seem to make much of a difference so it's mostly just a few want a bigger flame you can increase the flame height and that'll work so anyway if you liked the content in this video please like subscribe and comment below with any comments you have if you have any questions or comments had other experiences with these lighters that maybe I haven't had so anyway I'll see you in the next video thank you", "SaMkBYBE1oM": "[Music] hey guys John Faulkner here with survival dispatch and I'm here to answer one of your guys is frequently asked questions and that is how can we carry a fire system within our EDC because it can get complex and so you know a lot of people just say like hey just carry a lighter and and that's exactly you know pretty much what I do but I just make a couple modifications to it that can really increase the ability to get a fire started if you were to find yourself in extremely cold situation or an extremely wet situation so what I've carried for a long time just in that small coin pocket of your inside of your front pocket is just a small bit lighter and what I've done is I've made a few modifications to it and I'm gonna show you exactly what I do to my lighters so you can use a mini bic lighter or a standard sized lighter doesn't really matter just depends on you know what you want to carry I don't smoke you know but I carry a lighter every single day just as a resource to be able to have fire which is so critical if you were to find yourself in a survival situation from keeping warm to getting dry to signal it's just something that is very very useful so this is my lighter that I've carried with me pretty much every day for a couple of years now and I'm just gonna show you what I do to it so we're starting with just some regular big lighters here you can find me pretty much any convenience store rip the package open pull them out they're cheap they're affordable that's why I use them and then we're gonna use some EXO tech tender tabs not all tender tabs are created equal you should really look for the ones that kind of have like a pink or orange hue to it that means it's been pregnant with some kind of wax and what it'll do is it'll help the cotton stay dry and it'll make them burn longer each of these burn for about a minute or two so you know it gives you just a little bit of extended time without having to use that precious fuel that's in your bic lighter so rip this open pull these guys out here and then the last component is you got to have something to hold it all together and you can either use good old trusty duct tape or you can use like gaff tape gaffers tape rigger whatever they want to whatever you want to call it I like the gaff tape just a little bit more we're in the studio here it's always laying around but I like it just because it has a little bit more of a fabric feel and I think it burns a little bit better not to that in just a second so so we take a couple quick tender tabs here and what I do is is I just flatten them out they kind of come shaped you know in a in a circular shape and I just kind of press them out it's just going to make it fit in your pocket a little bit better and then I just take a piece of gaffer tape here and I just will adhere him to here and it's super simple and literally you just wrap the lighter at that point and it holds down your quick tabs I just throw these over here and I just go a couple wraps around with the gaff tape you always whistle while you work you know rip it off and then just literally just press it down and what I like to do is I try to get the top press down this one pretty quick so that's so that's the first modification I make I just add some quick tinder tabs and and then the last modification I'll do as you see in my mini bic lighter here is I'll add a zip tie I'll tie it around the back of the the lever so that the gas can't leak out it can't get depressed in my pocket and lose all the gas so I'll run a small zip tie around it and then it's good to go now if I ever had to start a fire what I'd simply do is just unpeel this and and like I said all we're trying to do here is get a longer burn time to guarantee if there's wet wood or anything like that we are able to to get it started I would take the top one and I would turn it right-side up and then watch this loosely as much as possible you kind of wrap it around back around now what this will do is it'll not only burn the tender tabs in a row so I stood the first one up but it's touching all the other ones and then just kind of put the gaffer tape on it so it'll stand up just like that and then you can simply just light the top of it and what this is going to do is this is gonna give me I've calculated it I've gotten ten and a half minutes of burn time just off this one part once the gaffer tape starts to burn and it keeps burning the tender tabs so what this allows me to do is get some little twigs some moss whatever you might be able to find that's dry and even if it's not dry it's enough of a flame and a large enough flame to start to dry a little bit of stuff out now what you'll see here and we inside something I can let it burn all the way is it starting to burn the gaff tape now also so the fires gonna get a little bit bigger a little bit hotter but it's still gonna burn pretty slow I'm still only about halfway through the first tinder tab so it's starting to burn the tape and it's going to start connecting and it's kind of like building a like a reverse fire so it'll kind of as it burns down it'll catch another tender wick and it'll start to burn again keeping it burning all the way down there we go I blew it out there get a little smoke in here but that's all right it's our studio we can do whatever we want Bobby Lynn lit our table on fire so so that is what I do to my bic lighters and then I put them in my pocket and I know that no matter what I have a good source of fire for 10 to 12 minutes in a very very small package and with the bic lighter I like to put two quick tinder tabs on it just because of the size of the lighter it fits on the side but that's what I do throw it in my pocket and you know that you're always going to have a successful fire if you like these short little videos on your how to make sure you come in and below on what you would like to

seconds it would look like more than that but you be the judge of it okay now we have our um a laminated paper press down on our oracle 651 we're going to take our image and we're just going to just put it right there on top of it get some heat tape to hold it down we're going to put it back on our heat press and we're going to press it for 60 seconds we're going to remove the paper from our heat press [Applause] take our image off [Applause] i'm just just cut the paper around it [Applause] once you have done that you can just cut it when you about to um put it on your lighter make sure you take this um this label off right here it's easy it's easy to pull off so you can just pull it off okay that's how your image is gonna look and you're just gonna pull the backing off of your vinyl for

god loves you and i love you too go ahead and hit that subscribe button thanks [Music]", "1ARCKpwDwJY": "Hello welcome to another video from Far North Bushcraft and Survival On a video, I did a while back about is a Ferro Rod worth having? A lot of people told me that a Bic lighter a butane lighter was the the ultimate survival fire lighter. I'm gonna tell you why that's a bad decision. Stay with me. Okay, well I'm glad that you joined me. My name is Lonnie Here is your standard Bic lighter, okay? now In spite of what many people have said The butane lighter does have several shortfalls one of them is if you get it wet it can be a bit difficult to start, there are ways of getting it started if it's wet. You need to know how to do that. Another way is if it gets cold. If it gets cold, it is not gonna light. You've got to get it warm back up, to light. Butane boils at a temperature of 31 degrees Fahrenheit, that's just under the freezing water or water freezes, okay? That's where butane boils. In other words that's where butane vaporizes from its liquid form. Okay, it's 16 degrees fahrenheit here now. So this is well below its boiling point. Okay It is not going to light. And to show you that it does have fuel in it Hopefully you can see that. Right there, hopefully you can see the fuel level in there. It's about 1/3 full, okay? Well you have to get it warmed up. So I know a lot of you right now are saying \"well, duh Just keep it in your pocket next to your body. That'll keep it warm. That's all you need to do.\" Well, that's not all you have need to do. If you're in the north country like I am Hopefully you can see that it's even snowing right now What if you fall through the ice and into the freezing water? Okay, you're gonna come out of there, your body's gonna be cold your body's not gonna be producing the heat that this needs to light. Okay So that's why A lighter is a bad idea to depend on. A lot of people go out with nothing but a lighter. They depend their life they let their whole life depend on this lighter Getting a fire going. Im trying to warm this up. I think we got it warm enough, maybe, that it will work There we go we got flames. I hope you can see that but like I said, you don't always have that option. You don't always have a way of keeping that lighter warm Okay? In that video where I was speaking of the The Ferro Rod I said, what is superior about the Ferro rod, is It doesn't matter how cold it is. It doesn't matter how wet it is. It will still spark, just great. The wet doesn't bother it at all the cold doesn't bother it at all. But It does require some skill to learn how to use. Okay, you need to learn what natural materials around you will work with a Ferro rod Which natural materials won't? I know a lot of people carry Man-made firestarters with them Such as a cotton ball. Vaseline soaked cotton balls, petroleum jelly soaked cotton balls. That's a great idea and I recommend that. Carrying something like that with you. However, I do not recommend relying on that, for the same reason I don't recommend relying on the lighter Technology can fail on you. Okay, you can you can use up your Vaseline soaked cotton balls, say if you're having a tough time getting the fire started You can use them all up, and then you're in trouble if that's what you've relied on. Okay, there is other options. Here is a container with matches in it, okay? That's great if Here, let me Keep searching here Now it looks like they're all Yeah, they're all storm proof matches. Which is your best option for matches, okay? because they'll handle the wet, they'll handle the cold just fine They'll handle damp Okay Regular matches, as long as this is Kept sealed you'll be okay but What happens if your buddy borrows this, and he doesn't get the lid tighten back up and you fall through the ice? In other words, what happens if your matches get wet? You're in trouble. What happens if you use up these storm proof matches? Again, you're in trouble if that is what you rely on. Okay, there's also other options These are all options, I carry with me all the time Okay, here's a magnifying glass That'll work just great If you have solar. On a day like today, we don't have solar. so Well, in survival When I'm in a situation where I think Survival might be a possibility In other words, when i'm going on a trip on the snow machines, or the boat, or you know I'm going on a distance trip where I need to rely on myself to get myself out if something goes bad okay, I'll carry a road safety flare with me if I need to get a fire going quick, I mean like right now that safety flare is one of the best ways of doing it but again, I don't rely on that What if I lost everything? You know what if I flew into a lake in a floatplane and when we landed we flipped the plane over and I was able to get out of the plane and swim to the shore with everything left behind, okay? What is the best fire lighting tool out there? Well I'm gonna say something that you're probably not thinking of and that is right here. This tool right between your ears okay. Knowledge. As you noticed I don't depend on any one thing to get a fire lighted. I light 90% of my fires with a Bic lighter. But I don't depend on that. I don't rely on that. If I lost everything, well I've Always got my carbon steel knife with me. If I can find me a chunk of quartz, and I can find me some chaga Which is fairly widespread here in Alaska. I can get a fire going. Chances are I can get a fire going that way. If that doesn't work, what can I do? Okay If there's no other way of getting a fire going, I can still light a fire with friction fire methods. I'm wearing a t-shirt, okay? The hem of that t-shirt can make a bowstring for the cordage on a bow, for a bow and drill friction fire. I'm wearing rubber boots. I don't have boot strings. Often times you'll have boot strings you can use as cordage to get a fire going with friction fire, using that as a cordage. Like I say This is the most important thing you can have for lighting fires. I encourage you not to rely on technology. In fact that goes for all of survival; Shelters, Fire, Food, Water. Don't rely on technology. Yes, have technology with you and use it but learn how to do without it. Well I hope you learned something in this video, and I hope you find it useful.

Thank you", "nJOpf80TK7M": "you know every once in a while i have to change up my edc kit because there's never a perfect edc kit now i had used this max petition fatty bag for some time it is a fantastic bag i mean the zippers are amazing because i had it so stock full you know if you look over here i think it is you can see a link to my video on that edc kit i was watching a video by sensible prepper and he had a new bag yeah it's made by right there and fire and there are some things about this bag i really liked one of the reasons i was drawn to this bag was because of the bright yellow background in the first compartment i think it makes it much easier to find things in the bag the other reason i was drawn to this bag was that in the second compartment on the right side it had a zippered pouch and on the left side it had two net pockets which i thought would really come in handy the other thing i liked it was similar in size to my fatty so i had to revise my kit and i thought i'd show you what i've done inside you know i've taken away some things and i've added some things so let's go in the house where it's not so windy and see the kids contents for your convenience all items contained in this edc kit are listed in the box below this video so let's get started oh xander wants to help out well he's playing with something and i probably should show it right here this is batty i don't know can you see them yeah and i had it in my my other bag and i keep them because it's kind of an inside joke where people think preppers are batty right well maybe not so much now since the pandemic started but anyway xander has adhd he has a very short attention span oh he's back again xander okay let's get started you'll see there's like a blanket pin on here that can come in very handy emergency situation and especially if you have a wardrobe malfunction an emergency whistle a little thumb drive to back up your data and what do we have up here okay a compass and some paracord and a bracelet and here a bandana and some of those little plastic zip ties they really can come in handy on the other side i have a flashlight this always comes in handy especially if i want to look through contents in the bag at night and i have a little mouth protector in case i would ever have to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation this can just let's see how you probably can't see it too well but it flickers see and if i was walking at night it could be good to have this this can help break out a window or can help cut a seat belt a good thing to have on hand i also have one of course in my vehicle and then i have a little measuring tape again i often use that okay now let's actually go inside you can see there's a lot of stuff in here but it's pretty well organized on this side well i don't have to take it out you can see it's a bit lighter down here it is a little multi-tool comes in handy and that's a gerber multi-tool you see here i have another one of those little type zip ties here i have something that i use a lot and i bet you rarely find this in a male's edc bag but it is eyebrow pluckers these little tweezers can work well on a sliver or something else a little piece of glass so really they're a good idea to keep on hand so i'm not going to take the whole thing out but this is the hydro blue mini water filter fits right in here which is great this is another [Music] i shouldn't say another this is a knife and it's much better than just one of the small blades that come on some and he knows right next to it i have my little thing of pepper because if i drive through some place and let's get say i get soup i want to make sure i have pepper too you know those are the kind of emergencies that are the everyday emergencies right and of course right next to it i also have salt and this is a screwdriver it has a phillips on the other side it's more for micro things like computers i always keep it in here and underneath here oh let's see nice tight fit wow you know what this is and it can really come in handy and it's just the right size to fit in my bag and you're noticing i'm taking time to put everything back but it took me quite a while to figure out the organization for it so i don't want to lose that okay then way over here this is a ferro rod it's really nice case and it's orange so you have less likelihood of losing it and it's by exo-tech and of course if you unscrew this side you also have a striker pretty neat so we have two ways of fire here we've got our thick lighter and we have this and i like that it's orange color because it's easier to find if you drop it now in the back here okay got some more of the plastic zip ties i got some floss you ever been in the car and you got something caught in your teeth this really comes in handy in your edc and that's it in this part now we have over here and right in the middle okay i have a magnet here can you tell it's a very strong magnet here we go again and i have used this to retrieve things uh like maybe i've dropped my keys in a spot that's hard to get out so i put a string on this put this down and oh i can get them so i always keep a magnet and of course this is a little pry bar and it fits just perfect right in here and up here i have this little stick on light but it is really bright and is great for seeing things inside here and this is the leatherman and i have the bit extender here because i do have additional bits in this case and behind that i can get out of here okay it's just a little ruler but that can come in handy too let's go over i'm going to take some of these maybe there's another name other than plastic zip ties because these really aren't plastic you know these are those great twisty ones but again i love using these and i love that they come in bright colors so take these off okay down here i have a little work sharp and it is for a knife kit you have ceramic side the other side you can sharpen your knives and it has some little tools that can help you tighten screws or other things on your knives so it's nice thing to keep in your edc and this is just one of those tools that you know primarily is going to be used for opening a bottle of beer or something like that okay but it does also have on it so you can do a can too so it's a can opener too what about in here okay and this is a box cutter or utility knife whatever you want to call it again can come in very handy in a lot of situations okay now over here okay you can see we have a lot of bits for the leatherman and back here more bits so that goes with the leatherman tool and here wd-40 right everybody needs to have that and this is a little toothbrush and this is some baking soda so don't have toothpaste in here but i have baking soda in case i need to brush my teeth quick maybe i forgot my toothbrush before i'm going to the dentist or something this way i have it in my edc and again i think you know what this is right nail clipper and i can't tell you how many times we're driving in the car and my husband will go do you have a nail clipper i have no idea why when he's in the car he thinks about clipping his nail but anyway comes in handy and then we have a pocket behind here which we have a lot of different things [Applause] in okay this is one of those handy dandy things that you'll probably never use right it's one of these little cards it's got a spear head or arrowhead a bunch of fishing hooks needles even a little saw i mean why not carry it and this is just instructions on how to use that hydro blue sidekick three stage draw water filter and then this is something that i encourage everybody to always use costs nothing open it up here anyway you can see it's just a tinfoil pan but this could be great for cooking for water for a lot of different things and it doesn't take up any room really i mean it really folds flat and then i'm not the best person to know how to make a knot but i know they're important so i have this pro knot shows all the different knots and well not all the different knots but a lot of the knots that are used so i have this to remind me how to make the knot i might need and then i have some neon tape it could be used as a trail marker and i have one last thing and that is just aluminum foil folded flat again great thing to carry with you you know in some cases like if it's snowy or whatever you need this for a base sometimes to build your fire because fire doesn't start well on snow anyway i'll put the rust back and that's it for this compartment now we're going to open the other compartment and this is what attracted me to this bag because it has a zippered pocket and these pockets here and you can kind of see what's in them i mean i think this was originally intended to be used for a med kit but i think it comes in great for the edc so let's see what's in this pocket so the first thing on this side is altoid mints you never know when you need fresh breath and this is a little sewing kit it has some needles in it safety pins two-sided tape thread just any basic thing you might need and quite a few needles even the upholstery needles in case you had to go through something thick to make it to mend it and of course cordage it's not paracord but i'm telling you this stuff can hold i believe up to 300 pounds uh it's really great and i find it much easier to tie knots and do things in so i love it copper wire and of course a right in the rain notebook this is the kind of book that you can write in it can even get wet and you're still going to be able to read it so if you need to leave an emergency note it's a great thing to have okay soap again hygiene need this is that tiny survival guide and it comes with a magnifying glass because it's awful tiny it would be hard for me to read but nice addition and this is something to wipe down my electronics with live fire great thing if you're going to stutter fire and you want to do it quick some water purification tablets super glue you never know when you might need that and of course this is amazing amazing stuff it's by gearward and a sharpie and i got this from a subscriber you're alone in the main woods well i might not be in maine but it might be in michigan anyway a lot of survival tips i almost missed this this is in there this is the aqua pouch so isn't this great you get some water and you put in your purification tablets and you're going to be ready to go so this gives you a nice size it's one liter so that's it for this side go to this side okay this is a little first aid kit probably more of a boo-boo kit right it has some cough drops you know the advil those type of tablets you know what you have an over-the-counter splinter out kit some alcohol pads of course a lot of band-aids just various things and if i'm with a female that all of a sudden it's her time of the month i have a pad available too so it has a lot of things that could be needed but more like a boo boo kit and this is a little flyer be smart be prepared a little first aid guide and these are all little tubes i've made from straws i'm sure you've seen that before this is a hot melt glue this is tea tree oil this is lavender oil which of course i use all the time for burns and stings and neosporin and this is from survival resources and it's a fresnel magnifier and yeah something i don't see in the edc a lot but i think it can be pretty essential which is kleenex i mean when my nose runs or when i get a bloody nose i'd like to have this on hand and last but not least some money this is all smaller denominations and there are coins in between so that's it for my bag you may wonder where do i keep my edc kit and i have a net that goes in between my two front seats and i flop it right there so it is always with me in the car and i always have it do i carry it everywhere with me no so it's not technically an everyday carry but it is an edc kit kept in my car and is very convenient to me for use thanks for watching this video i hope you enjoyed seeing my edc kit and as always stay safe you", "kKvXb0kKP9Q": "you hey gang bison here today I'd like to talk about these lighters you see sitting here these are called clipper they are lighters that are refillable they take butane and there's a really cool feature or two about these I would like to tell you about in a minute I learned about these from my buddy in Greece Niko's his youtube channel is Nick diver and I kg yve are go check him out does a lot of cool tricks with Victorinox knives and he's an avid outdoorsman and practices survival he makes lots of good kits and has lots of great gear so check him out so Thank You Niko's for tell me about these lighters so let's take a look at one close-up this is a translucent one they come in various colors obviously now as we said it is refute refillable unlike a disposable lighters you can buy like bake and whatnot now these items overseas you can find them lots of gas stations at petrol stations these I have never seen anywhere in America I had to get these off of the internet I think I got all six of them for like six dollars and change probably came to seven bucks with shipping so it's practically like a buck apiece so like I said they are refillable they're made out of a nylon material which is awesome because a lot of the other lighters you can buy out there like BIC and stuff that are disposable are plastic this is nylon so when you light it you can keep this flame lit for about two minutes before it starts to burn the nylon whereas you know after you know under a minute with your plastic ones it starts to melt and the flint wheel would pop off and the light a bit hot or just shut off so that's really cool about the material it's made out of so you can keep it lit to use the lighting source for about two minutes or if you're trying to get something lit you can hold it for about two minutes and also the cute cool thing with these butane lighters is as you tip it the flame does get higher if you're lighting a pipe or any other things that you guys and girls out there like to light that are not legal so that's a little bit about the lighter but now the really awesome feature about this why I would recommend this for an EDC type of use bug out survival type of scenario is if you don't want to carry the lighter and its whole you can actually remove here the Flint compartment and it just slides right back in there which is very cool so if you don't want to carry a lighter and your true survivalist you want to just start a fire with a spark or you have your lighter and you add a butane in this a viable situation you can't refill it and you have some type of tinder with you you can just take out the Flint and you've got your spark source right there and the other cool thing is the wheel has got this kind of ridged type of thing to it where it's not like the little round grooves where if you know what situationally wearing gloves it's much easier to spark it then it's smaller lighter and it's a bit beefier too to actually get a good grip on and there is a little knob here which is very difficult to turn let's try and use a plier and as you unscrew it you can actually remove just be careful doesn't launch on you the spring and you can change the Flint I'm not sure if the same size Flint as Zippo lighters there's been a lot of discussion about that I've seen online but you can replace the flint what it wears down in time so you can actually bite assortment of these and keep the striker portion and your various kits that you have for you know you EGC your bug out or what have you and then she slides right back in nicely like so and there you go so there's a look at the Clipper refillable butane lighter let me know if anybody could find these in the US I haven't seen him in any gas stations or anywhere else I'm not a smoker so I know we don't buy lighters so I just got these to put my various kicks maybe take out the Flint's and stick them in my smaller pouches and stuff so I was not a different spark source always like to carry three four different ways to make it fire with me because you never know all right gang so go check out the clip a lighter give me your feedback on it and thanks again to a Niko's for turning me on to this awesome idea and product all right gang thanks for watching bye you so now you you", "Q-rQ2mCOEMM": "hello everyone dj blindblink here so i kept my alloy it's a diamond cut i've kept it before and i've repaired it and i'm going to do a video now that's going to show you how you can do it i'm going to show you the tools and everything you need to do most important thing is you need to be very patient when repaying the alloy you need to be very very patient so let's show it to you now let's have a look at the damage you can see it's right here all the way from the top all right we're going to go all the way downward all the way to the bottom and also at the back and there you can see it also that's a little bit at the bottom it's been scruff yeah so that's it you can see how nasty that is yeah you can see very very nasty very very nasty all right now let's get down to the tools you're gonna need you're gonna need a wet and dry paper 800 this is what you need to file down everything when you're done memory clothes are sorted it contains one fine one medium and one quart six you need this lighter the alloy will lycra right you need water in a spray can that you can spray and you need anything that you can use to hold um the the clutch you're going to use to file down right so the process is going to fold this down after filing this down you clean it up and after cleaning it up then you spray the lycopene so we're going to get this started now one thing you need to notice is this the emery clothes are sorted the first one you're going to use cannot be used wet you need to use it dry all right so that's what you're going to use to file everything down you know to get everything smoothed now the wet and dry paper this one this one you'll be spraying water with so the first one no water this one water so let's get down to this so the one i'm picking up now is the medium the one medium from the emery clothes are sorted i'm going to do this part then i'm going to zoom in and then you see the bottom part so i'm going to do it for my final so you can see it you can see what i'm doing just taking a little bit all right just a little bit put it on this all right and then i can use it to file it's just to hold this you really don't if you don't want to have used anything you can use this alone but to get it good smooth don't don't worry yourself too much if you're filing away yeah just you know concentrating on this area and go in one motion [Music] now it's getting smooth get this smooth already so now let's get the clock off adjust this alone so now i've used the medium to falling down a little next thing i'm going to have taken the other one the one cross all right and then just holding it remember it's rough it's more rough than the medium [Music] so now i'm going to zoom in and then you see it's more closely right all right so i'm going to do a close shot now so you can see it's gonna fall away this gives you a better view of what i'm doing so yeah we're taking away the top layer more and more so we're still using the cross and the medium that's you know you're alternating between them is the medium now no water not a single drop of water at all yeah i'm gonna zoom out now you can see how smooth it is it doesn't even look as if it's been kept yeah and this is without the lyka no like i yet we've not added the lanca so yeah just keep going back and forth back and forth back and forth back and forth so now i'm going to wipe it down you see okay dry cloth also to clean it so you can see what you're doing all right so we've got the dry cloth [Applause] wiping it down so we can see what we're doing yeah what i'm going to do now is going to use a phone camera to record this look at the video from the phone camera you can see what we've smoothened out yeah let's go close to it you can see all what we've done yeah we're gonna smoothen it some more oh yeah that's it all the way yeah with the phone camera okay so next one we're gonna use this is the part of water and wet and dry paper how do you do this you're gonna spray and then you wipe down yeah you lavish lavishes with water lots of water so see yeah you can see what i'm doing let me take this camera backwards spray and rub you can see i keep spraying the water i'm not even slowing down at all at all don't even make the mistake yeah i was slowing down the water so what do we want what we're going to do now we're going to wipe it take a look we still got some little tiny marks here i want to get it off and then we're gonna work on that so remember no water this is the class one yeah after this i'm going to do the back wheel i'm not going to show the video of the back way because as you know will is a wheel well yeah let's keep watching this so yeah it's all about patient you got to be very very patient here but now to be honest you can't even see any mark now i'm not bothering again here i don't want to take away anything from here i'm just dealing with the part now but you can see back and forth back and forth back and forth back and forth so yes this is good i'm happy save myself some money and do it myself again what next remember water and this slavish spray and wipes yes as much water as possible all right this is super smooth i'm gonna wipe it down now and i'm gonna record it also with the phone camera so you can see i can come more closer so you can see what we've done this we've done all the repair very smooth yeah all the way down there super smooth that's it so next stage we need to spray the alloy we like onto it um it's usually advisable to spray this at you know warm temperature like 20 degrees and above but what about if you're in winter you know there's no sunlight what would you do so what i do is i put this in warm water very hot water not warm water i boil water to 100 degrees dump this in it shake it very well and then spray it and then i wait 12 hours so when i spray it now i'm not going to spray it again until tomorrow evening so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to boil water dump this in it wait for it to warm up and then spray it so let's get the hot boiling water so this is what i mean you drop the aloe vera lacquer into warm water you can see boiling water so let's just leave this for a while and then yeah we're good to go all right so it's gotten dark now i've had some more lighting now while the lacquer paint is um heating up in the warm water what you can what you need to do is get some any cards any set of cards you can get there any cards you can get just put them in here because remember you're going to spray all the way at this side and you don't want a situation where um you don't want a situation where the locker itself goes on the wheels so next we're gonna do we're gonna cover all the area we don't want the lacquer to land on with as much tape as you can you know paper tape anything just protect all those areas [Music] time to spray so how am i gonna spray this stuff just a quarter length away from the alloy wheel i'm gonna go this way that way this way that way don't let it drip yeah do not let it drip so just go this motion this motion this motion this motion and then you wait for 12 hours and then you do another one again 12 hours between each coat right so let's get this done so that's the lacquer can it's warm for the touch shake shake shake shake shake shake it for about two minutes and then spray you can see what i'm doing yeah see that motion it's not gonna drip don't let it drip yeah and that's it let it dry 12 hours you're back again so i've decided to make a quick video of the repair before i post the video on my youtube channel but you can see this was where i did all the walks everything looks smooth and very good i've not done the second coat for the lacquer that's going to be done later on this evening for the 12 hours but yeah this is a close shot you wouldn't even know that alloy when that's being cleared that's all and if you look at the back wheel that this walks also on the back wheel also you can see it it looks very very good all right that's it it's all done it's all sorted the cabin all the shenanigans on the wheel has been cleared so remember the whole process you need to be very patient get all the materials use the rough one use the medium one and then you know spray with water use the wet and dry spray you know rub spray and rub and then you know heat up your lacquer um if you need to and if it's not warm enough put the candle around it and then spray it in one motion 12 hours later that's important part 12 hours later you're going to come back again and then spray it so yeah if you like this video give me a thumbs up remember to leave a comment below if you have any questions just drop it in the comment section below and also most importantly subscribe to my channel remember to subscribe to my channel for more videos and tips so yes this is dj bling bling you know how we do you know how we do signing out [Music] do [Music] you", "9ZaFnSNXO1E": "[Music] big gliders last longer i should have got one of the mini ones for this oh geez still got a ton it's up past where i was i thought it should have been should have been empty got a drill or something [Music] out there there we go oh yes i got her that time so i've taken it upon uh myself as a personal challenge to see if i can get a fire going today um with a dead lighter i always carry a big light in my pocket but what happens if all of the fuel is gone is it still possible to get a fire with that tiny little ferrocerium rod basically that we've got going on there i don't know i've never done it before and i thought today is just about the worst possible conditions to try to get this done so so if i can do it today with a dead lighter i can make it happen pretty much anywhere so that's what we're that's the mission for today dead lighter fire the problem is going to be finding dry tender of any kind and when i'm using this tiny tiny striker that tiny ferro rod that's on the bic lighter i'm gonna need to find the finest driest tender imaginable otherwise it's just not gonna work and what i'm looking at is these little seed heads here and if i'm very delicate with them i might be able to gather them up and see how fine and fuzzy and fluffy that is hopefully we can focus in on that right there and my hands are a little bit cold but it feels dry to me this would be probably ideal for what i'm trying to do but it is wet really wet try the uh the blonde watch out here yeah even if it's wet you might be able to yeah maybe this stuff here maybe is pretty damp but maybe if i pluck it walk around with it for a bit while i'm searching for everything else i can get it to dry out a smidge these are reasonably dry dead pine needles that are still attached to the branches and up off of the ground anything on the ground right now is not going to work at least not now it'd take a while to dry it out this stuff is de it's damp but may be doable now i'm just going to be looking for some tulip poplar strip off the inner bark of the tulip popper make myself a bird's nest and hopefully i can find something that's reasonably dry so this is the jackpot right here feels really dry well driest that we found so far because it's been way up high off of the ground and it's already processed out for me by the wind it looks like a little bit so that's a good that's a good thing and that's going to be yeah that feels pretty dry and this right here is probably enough to make my tinder bundle which is great so you can see the difference in color between these two um this blondish color is much much better it's drier it's still got some fibrous fibrosity that's that's another word that i'm gonna go with it's got some fibrosity to it this stuff here is wet it's darker in color it's a little bit more decayed but it could probably still still work it would just need more processing and more time to dry out it wouldn't be a deal breaker but that like chocolatey kind of dark color just means it's been on that it's been there a lot longer dead a lot longer not that we couldn't get to work but for right now fire it's not going to work so in this area the white pine in my opinion is the go-to fire tree for a couple different reasons one the dead branches on the bottom like this especially the ones where they've kind of turned that whitish color and they the bark has fallen off are really really dry and they will light up really quick with any kind of open flame as long as we can get the open flame the other reason i really like the white pine well besides being perfect stuff for um a primitive fire friction fire bow drill is this sap that collects at the base of the branches any place where a tree's been damaged or sometimes not even doesn't have to be damaged just has to have a a place for the sap to leak out this is kind of ideal stuff right here and i would call this a flame extender because it's got see that squishiness i can stick my finger in it it's got it's solid but yet it's not runny like sap but it's got that squishiness to it and if i add that to a tinder bundle add that to my kindling and i get this lit on fire that will burn for a long long long time and it will dry out anything that i put on my fire so if i could collect this stuff hopefully not get my hands crazy sticky another benefit of that is adding it to the shaft of your uh spindle when you're doing a hand drill fire it gives you traction that's right you know your hands get slippy sometimes i will use that uh myrrh and crittenden taught me that [Applause] so this tender is pretty damp i can feel it it's dampness but as i do this and i rub it against itself and against my hands it it's warming up that friction is creating some heat and it's drying it out just by working it and it's making it finer and with this kind of fire that we're talking about here the finer the better i mean it's light and as fuzzy as i can make that the more gooder and all of this right here i'm collecting on my vest and that see how light and fuzzy that is that might be enough i might be able to light that um with the bic but we're gonna find out here real soon that stuff's perfect that's really really good stuff and it's pretty dry as dry as anything out here look at that really fibrous this would make the good cordage too if i wanted to make cordage out here well i'll show you real quick i just twist it twist the fibers up turn it over itself like so and then just continue that process twist away from me and towards me away from me and towards me away from me and towards me and pretty soon you get strang and here and these parts i can't think of cordage that's i can't think of anything that would make stronger quarters than tulip poplar bark that grows naturally here alan do you know what anything better well animal hides obviously but well there is yucca but it's not it doesn't grow native here right rarely usually it's in cemeteries no home sites and stuff like that poplar bark is definitely plentiful anywhere in the mountains yeah but this is pretty strong cordage and it's in the blondes condition if it was too far gone and started to turn that brownish chocolatey color it wouldn't be as strong but this stuff as is is pretty pretty stout string right there just on feel alone this one's the best right here that one's a little bit damper than this one so maybe first second third and i put this one on top and this stuff when i create my bird's nest this is what i'm gonna do i guess i could go ahead and make some of that happen but i'm gonna create a bird's nest literally something that looks like a bird's nest something a bird would want to live in and then this really good dry dust that was a result of processing the tinder down that is gonna go in the middle and see how light fluffy that is so we've got our dead lighter nothing this puppy's not going to light i drilled a hole through the bottom so all the fuel is gone all right so i've got some really fuzzy stuff sticking out right here really fine little tender if i can get that to light don't know yep all right so that's not working that's all right seed heads down see if i can get them to light up those are pretty fuzzy and all i need is a tiny little flame if i could get this to give me a little bit of flame it'll light the rest all right so it's not it's not happening i'm not getting flame like i was hoping for off of this tiny tiny little ferro rod here inside the lighter so i wonder if i could without breaking it remove this metal piece off the front of the lighter oh yeah like that looks more promising to me it's tough getting it close enough getting it close enough without screwing it all up that's as fine as we can get it what else could i do let me take a break so this cat tail the seeds in it are in the bajillions and as you spin it you can see them opening up and look at that pretty incredible how many seeds there are in one cattail head and that is as light and as dry and as fluffy of a tender that is imaginable if this doesn't work i don't know what we'll do we'll go to plan c let's give it a shot at that hopefully that's on camera we got fire we had fire but we're not out of the woods yet here we go here we go look at that well son of a gun buddy winners find a way winners find a way you know most people would have quit with the really fine tinder yeah because i thought for sure i i thought that was going to work i thought our um are really processed down um poplar tinder was going to work but it did not what moisture i think was the issue yeah in that and what was going to be our next course of action if the cattail didn't work was i was going to dissect a what's gonna sector cartridge here see if i can get some powder out and see if that works that's gonna be a separate video i think just to see if we can make that happen but but with a dead lighter with zero fuel in it i've got a good one in my pocket because i'm not stupid but i've got a with a dead lighter removing the the shroud off the front i think was was a really helpful tip something that we should definitely keep in mind is removing the metal shroud but that tiny little spark with the right tender it's got to be the finest driest fluffiest tinder and the cattail was it this stuff right here that is as fine of a tender as you can possibly get that just drives home you know the mindset thing never quit yeah never give up figure out a way like you know this i knew that there was spark here and i knew that if i just figured it out and i have that concept of of tender if i have that the finer the better if that concept of dry two ideas that really were pivotal is one we said hey let's take that shroud off and see if they give us a better spark and then we kept trying different tenders yeah exactly yep and that we got fire with a dead lighter yep and i might add a very wet you know we've had snow laying on the ground here for what four days yeah pretty pretty high humidity it's cold out snow is everywhere ground is wet everything's pretty much wet you can see the our tender bundle isn't really even burning up that well because of how wet it is all that moisture in it see it's smoking a ton it's not like it's just poof and it's gone because yeah normally like with a friction fire and an optimal bundle that would have already been gone pretty much yeah but our kindling's on fire yep tinder's still here so that is a successful fire yeah well done another plan well executed well i think that that's the that's the biggest thing to take away from this i i was not going to give up on this no matter what that's just kind of my personalities i don't i don't uh winners find a way and i'm not gonna give up trying until it's just you know it's you you've exhausted all efforts and even then you can usually come up with something else we had ammunition we could have lit yeah i was going to tear apart a tear apart of a nine millimeter round and get to the powder and see if i could get that to light up that didn't work we could have defaulted to a bow drill yep because we had good tinder we just didn't have the thing that would transfer to that initial flame absolutely yeah if that fails we go to the nearest trailer park you steal some gas there you go that's right that's where you fart on it but the but that uh but with that along those same lines that's the the importance of if you're going into a woodland environment something that's a little bit more off the beaten path you should take definitely more than one way to start a fire because that one lighter that you have could easily not work uh the difference between having a lighter with a flame yeah and one that's just a spark source yep how long would you say you worked on that uh i'd say a total two to two to three hours maybe and if you had a flame yeah ten minutes yeah yeah less than 10 with with a lighter that worked i could have had a fire i would say under five i would have had that success right there um i could have skipped a lot of the steps i wouldn't have to process the tinder as finely and as carefully but without that tiny little ferro rod that's in the lighter you've got to be re every little detail matters but that's why i carry i'll show you what i carry i carry a bic lighter a functional bic lighter this is not the functional one functional bic lighter in my pocket and every morning when i put this in my pocket i shake it just to confirm it's got fluid still left in it and then attached to my belt right here on a lanyard so i cannot lose it it's on my belt i've got a nice long five or six inch ferro rod right here and this with this and that tender model that i had without question i would have had a fire so even if my lighter my primary source of flame was to you know take a crap on me this will work but anyway i really appreciate you watching guys thanks for stopping in hit the thumbs up subscribe if you haven't already and we'll see you next time you", "3Wmfc9hUVqo": "you [Applause] hello hello today I'm gonna show you an awesome unboxing

brightness comes from the LED balloon lights those balloons should be inflated by an inflatable equipment like pop electrical air balloon pumps would be a better choice of course but I do not own this sorry for it please do not blow the balloon with your mouse do not put the balloons near fire sources sharp items secrets secret lighters fire the often you're neither hot areas to activate the allottee balloons all you need is to do the two AAA batteries in the battery box and switch to on just Dan that's awesome really awesome it looks really beautiful this is a nice decoration of thing

is 40 i am going to use 40 centimeters of filling circle you can first approach or inflate this and Dan you can put the balloon put other small balloons you can choose what you like the color of paper and other fillers and the continue to inflate that means you can make a special thing inside pull something good inside pump it up and shake it awesome really awesome the last three meters nine point eight four feet the metros naturally latex the color is much covers the LED quantity thirty it is waterproof ip6 for the ball on the eyes is up to 18 inches and you will need each balloon to AAA batteries and you will get here as I got it now you see eight times LED wedding balloons four times copper wire lights eight times balloon horror sticks four times transfer tubes and ten times rope four balloons and now let's assemble it and have a look how it looks and I think it is really beautiful thanks for watching please subscribe me and give me a positive feedback and I hope to see you again on my channel soon soon [Music] [Music] [Music]", "95QT-qM5bjk": "here's a very unusual trick with a piece of tissue paper got a gift wrap paper and what you've seen here and people can examine I've drawn a little target a little bullseye here on this like this and I've got a whole bunch everybody's favorite magic object and look I'm gonna notice that I could maybe try to reach all the way in and punch a hole here and what I'll do it here on camera for you but you can even have a spectator say the spectator punch a hole in either corner so let's say they punch a hole here like that and you make sure to remove the little paper so they've done it they've examined it punched a hole in it like this okay you say along with this we're also gonna use a lighter okay but take this and ball this up into a little ball piece of tissue paper remember they examine this they punch the hole you're showing your hands empty everything's cool and I got the lighter here and I've also got a little mug like this keep this on camera here nothing suspicious watch it's gonna spark the piece of tissue paper [Music] just like that and keep in mind you show your hands empty the mug can be examined they're the ones who examine the piece of tissue paper that you obviously just sparked you ask them they can examine of course the cigarette lighter you ask them to gently open this up as carefully as they can and they find that fire truly is magic because the heat of the flames caused the hole in the tissue paper to travel to jump to melt from one of the corners where they punched it till now it is in dead center of the bowl this is a piece of tissue paper what I've done a drawable target around it three rings with a sharpie marker okay and I got a hole punch and I punched a hole in the dead middle of this okay this is a piece of tissue paper or the hole running through the middle this is a piece of flash paper now flash paper if you're certainly if you're young or old obviously you're under 16 or ten or three you shouldn't be handling flash paper but uh so I'm gonna tell you right now handle this stuff with your own risk it's super dangerous you will find a lot of magic shops online sell flash paper big sheets and pads and things and Sankey magic calm on my site you'll find we've got the only thing I sell there the flash pads I'm also gonna use a mug or a ashtray or something like that or you can drop it on a bar table as long it's not tablecloth gonna need a lighter as well so what's the performance well I've got my tissue paper balled up with a hole okay and I'm gonna have to palm that in at some point I can start the whole thing with this palm dependent here this is called the people PE eight not PE e that's a very different kind of trick is keep on they can be here here okay or you could even just have it loosely in the finger palm and from the very beginning you can bring this out say I'm drawing a little target here the whole punch go ahead punch a hole but not in the middle let's make it hard for me maybe punch it somewhere else anywhere else but not in the middle this corner that corner wherever you want they can examine that and punch the hole and the whole time I can this Punk or I can have this in my pocket say with the lighter or even the hole punch or whatever I want I can hand this show my hands absolutely I have this examine duck Duck Duck and any time when I go to my pocket for the hole punch or the lighter I just palm this in them your choice okay but let's say I have it pawn the whole time okay like here piece of tissue paper go ahead punch this where you want the spectator grab the hole punch they punch it here like this okay like that beautiful clean convincing match now because this is flammable they're quickly flammable and this is not as quickly flammable it's just tissue paper all I have to do is take this okay show it both sides lay it down on the other piece and follow this up around it this is the principle I came up with original principle of mine many years ago and I've used it in many ways because now look you show your hands empty there's nothing to see this is the just examined piece you are so far ahead so now usually in magic when you're using a duplicate you have to Palm it out but not here here I'm just gonna set it aflame it's gonna instantly clean up everything for me so they've examined this they punched a hole show this empty take this come over here spark this get a beautiful flash of fire drop that down they can see it's the same piece still the piece but now it's charred totally adding to magic the drama there's nothing to ditch nothing to get rid of and you ask them or I offer will be the one to do this because it's charred if they open it up too quickly they can tear it or hurt it I want to make sure any even and gingerly tentative gentle nature there's three words totes loli open this up and they see that the hole they punched has impossibly moved right into the dead center of the target I'm gonna drop the cards and at some point I want you to say the words stop right there you're sure okay take a look at the card and I want to see it got it okay now can doing anything tricky cuz I said stop whatever you want the cards in the card case what color was the car oh that works with fire that's perfect and tell me what suit was the car a diamond a red diamond that makes sense and finally what was the was it a face card a number card what was it number card what number seven you're sure seven so so spread through see anything has happened here right there only one card in the entire pack has some smoke on its back in a very distinctive shape in this case in the shape of a seven so all I've done is I take a seven seven diamonds in this case and I take this cut out card I put it on like that okay now you then I hold it and you want to make sure it's not buckled or the smoke gets in at a funny angle and it will take the edge off the clean lines so you gently hold it finger here and you take a lighter okay let's case the letter and all I'm gonna do is wave this over the lighter okay Anna carefully weigh the lighter underneath until I get a nice clean smoke and notice I'm using a red back card I've done it with blue back cards for sure but the red makes it more pronounced right so now I've got this now I'll tell you right now the moment you have this smoked you need to bury this in the deck and put a couple rubber bands around it I have learned the hard way after so many years of fiddling with this stuff two rubber bands one of each end should be you want to make sure it's really really tight because if you don't what happens and then you got to leave this so I'd leave it overnight because it's funny even after an hour to the heat warps the card and the card will end up not being perfectly clean or straight unless you really bind it like this I just had this on the bottom of the deck I cut the cards kept a break directly below the center okay fingers on the front here to make sure I'm not gonna flash mine and I'm holding the break with one hand just with my thumb now you'll find if you ask someone to say stop and you look at their lips they will move their lips then the movement other lips will be just before they say stop or at least at the very same time so you can dribble the cards slowly and the moment you see their lips move you just drop everything below the brake boom down so it can look very fair okay right there at the card they skal stop and then I just lean these up and show these seconds show just call stop they call stop lean that up and show the seven and you get this really beautiful drop no moves into the carcass have them remove a match have them think of their card have them and you don't even ask questions just on camera here I thought it was easier with Chris have them spark it and say whatever your card is king queen of two I want you to sort of write the shape or write the number or face if the K for king queen and a a two for two whatever and write it in the air do not underestimate the power of this it's so simple so dramatic you get this gorgeous reveal here then you get the car there nice two beats no duplicates very powerful beautifully use of smoke the last trick I'm going to share with you guys is an absolute reputation maker the imagery the magic the involvement I've been doing this for years I know you're gonna really like it Chris I'm gonna go through the cards have it call stock whatever you want man right there okay I'm gonna cut the cards I'm gonna push the card you stopped me forward and give you a little peek at it give you guys a second you got it okay keep it in mind okay now look I'm gonna try to find the one card Chris chose here we go couple cuts I'm hoping they're I'm hoping they're boom right to the top impossibly I'm pretty sure Chris three times right that was your card right with this sorry wasn't the three I'm gonna have to renovate this cards I have to use some magic here see see if I can do this look Chris take this marker and to keep it everything honest to the fair just put your big initials on the back nice like this Thanks get you back behind the camera so we can see I hope to some blurry neck switch here okay so he signed the back of his car here and the one I missed it wasn't the three um was it close to the three of diamonds yeah it was close okay well is it which to okay this is gonna be easy watch it's the wave of the hand you guys watch you're gonna visibly see this cars go free and I don't even have to use all my thing I can issue four or even three or watch just with one finger three to the to the - thank you very thanks folks no refunds on this show no I know you know what's giving this away now the illusion is perfect I mean that looks like a three or two I should say looks exactly the - except for these this is what is giving it away so actually if I take the card and I fold over there and I fold over there now look it's almost a perfect illusion now now if I just cover that up like that now it looks like the cards supposed to be but of course there's still this problem so look go into my pocket here gonna eat this on camera don't want you in a course it's obviously just making sure it's Christmas signed card watch gonna get the lighter a little magical fire here and I'm gonna see if I can heat up that middle annoying this and everything's fair nothing in my hands now see if I can maybe oh yeah look look look with a little bit of heat I'm actually able look I want you to see this I'm able to peel off the one little bit of ink and now hopefully I've changed it into a two from a three - Chris is - and remember it's with a signed card that can be closely examined given the fact that 99.9% of the tricks I share in this channel are absolutely free I figured was okay to throw in on the end here one of my marketing tricks reconstruction we're gonna reveal it right now to buy the specialty printed custom labels die-cut the whole thing and go to Sankey magic calm I've been doing this trick forever it is a monster it's all you know this one of these things you pretty much have to close with let's cut right now and I'm gonna show you the details and reveal the secrets to my trick reconstruction now the tutorial video that comes along with a special gimmicks for reconstruction is far more details than this but I'll show you kind of the broad strokes right here reconstruction comes with a hundred special labels clubs spades hearts and diamonds you get a hundred so you get a hundred amazing reactions so for that and it usually retails for about fifteen bucks so for that in that regard it's a super cheap for huge crazy reactions now my favorite way to do it is with red back cards but you can do with glue back as well and these special gimmicks are designed to be work not just with bicycle cards you'll find they work with most standard looking brands of poker or bridge sized cards so super flexible what I've done here is I've taken one of the hearts off okay and I just with a corner of a playing card I just stick the heart to the corner of this and I laid it neatly down the middle and stuck it down onto this too and it was a trippy looking card it's a two of hearts but with a three pips now I don't want to forget to mention that you can make a to look like a three a four looks like a five a six look like a seven I don't want you thinking you can do this trick with only two is your threes so there's lots and lots of options to perform this trick in this case I've got a two and A three got the heart on here and this set up very simple all I need to do is have the two and the three on top of the deck and whenever I want to I can close my show with this crazy interactive monster trick performance dead simple all I do is cut the pack and keep a pinky break they call stop I cut the deck okay and I simile let you have a peek at the top card and they are peeking the top card it's the two but because I won't be pushing it out a little away I'm actually showing them to prepared a freaky card for better luck so they just get to see the two they don't even know they're already looking at the bizarro card okay so they see the two then I push that back down give the deck a false cut okay or you could do that cut I use a lot here in the channel where you grab the bottom and slap those down just a quick illusion that makes it look like a cut but everything is on top then I say I've cut to your card da da da here's your card that's your card and they go no that's not my card like a what it's not your card no okay well what I'm gonna have to magically change the card turn the double lift over so simple have them put their name on the back of the card their initials you're down to here so this already shouts closing effect because you're just showing a card for them right and it's so worth it like I said I turn the double lift back over and I say so okay the three wasn't your card what was it they say the two and I go oh this is easy watch this gonna wave my hand you're gonna see a change and I do this and I can't tell you guys how consistently this silly joke is a huge laughs watch it change from the three to the two so simple I say but these are the problems giving it away right I could see that so now I come over and I pretend to take the three off the deck but all I do is slide the card beneath it to two since I'm holding a double lift as I turn over but the signature shouts is the same card but I've switched it okay so literally just from the same double lift I pull that off this goes to my pocket the trick is done they have no idea how far ahead you are so I bend this corner over so I'm gonna cover up those threes they've been given away my trick and now it almost looks exactly like your - and look how far ahead you are do this gag again there it is I said well I know this is one all right let me do some wheel magic here to do this so now I get to take the lighter and for years I didn't use this technique I could just slowly had somebody peel off the PIP or I peeled it off but I loved the fire aspect of this now because you're gonna be left with a silhouette in the Sun here lean right in start to pluck this off a little bit and take your time on this because as soon as they start to see the suit the little PIP come off the cart people lose their bleep okay right like that it comes off so much magic so magic number one this chest came off magic number two this pit changes magic three this pit changes and you have an absolutely perfect souvenir sign card and the smoke gives a little story the smoke basically tells the story if you're interested in flash paper or the

a pocket lighter can be dangerous the majority of pocket lighter models do not conform with these standards all big pocket lighters meet or exceed all applicable laws and standards worldwide at BIC we manufacture the best lighters in terms of quality and safety how first thanks to our unique manufacturing process big pocket lighters are produced in big factories in France and Spain giving us the full control over the production every big lighter undergoes more than 50 individual automatic quality and security checks before leaving the factory we also use the best raw materials our lighters are filled with pure isobutane ensuring a stable flame height without any spitting and sputtering the bic lighter is made of Delrin this material ensures a high resistance to impact to elevated temperatures and pressure it is so resistant that it is used to manufacture security seat belts this material has a specific molecular structure which cannot be transparent on average a big maxi lighter contains up to 3000 lights that's up to two times more lights than other flint lighters of the same format this dedication to quality and safety makes us the number one pocket lighter brand in the world Vic our quality your safety", "77OtwZGG0ak": "alright guys so this week's video is going to be all about lighters as you can see I have quite a few lighters and the very first thing that we're gonna do and the reason you probably clicked on this video we're going to put lighters inside of a deep fryer and see what happens before we get started I feel like it is necessary to say every thing I'm gonna be doing in this video is dangerous and stupid so I have 26 years experience of being an idiot so don't know what I'm gonna say so I have 26 years of experience being an idiot and doing stupid things so just leave it to me now let's get started alright guys you can see that we have come outside for obvious reasons I don't want oil all over my garage we have the white table and the deep fryer and the deep fryer is up to well if you can see it 392 degrees even though it says the max is 375 so better for us right here I have two purple lighters we're gonna put them both in there at the same time see what happens both of them do work so here we go three two one oh well okay that was rather fast let's do a couple more that was actually way faster than I thought and very anticlimactic so just for fun let's do three three lighters three-two-one all right well I guess we're moving on to the next thing if anybody wants some well done lighters I have five of them here I'll give them to you half off all right so it is a very good thing that I keep white tables in stock because I think that table has seen its last day I know that was pretty anticlimactic I thought it would be thought they would be more exciting than that so we're gonna move on to our next experiment the microwave we're gonna put lighters in the microwave let's see what happens all right so obviously this is very straightforward we have the microwave and way the lighter so put this in here you can see that this microwave has definitely seen better days set the layer up right there in the middle and then we're gonna go let's just go one minute to start and then I'm gonna go hide over here three two one [Music] [Music] all right I think that is enough now that was the reaction that you wanted just in case ooh I think there's still some butane in there boiling that's I don't know what to do let's go ahead and close this if there's butane in there then it could still explode so that is dangerous I don't know what to do I never learned about this in science class let's use a broomstick and just all right so I guess I was just being paranoid there's actually enough fluid in here but those really cool so let's do that again but let's do it with like scoped two lighters right one minute again three two one [Music] Oh [Music] that could not have been any more perfect I guess I'm not a very good firefighters all right that was pretty perfect all right so since two liners is enough to open the door in the microwave and I'm starting to fill up with smoke in here I think we'll probably call it quits with the microwave and go into something else all right moving on to our next experiment clearly see what I have here is I have a 2x4 that has a little bit of nano tape on the bottom to stick it to the table and I have a lighter that I have stuck to the top of this 2x4 with duct tape then I have this heat young obviously the experiment is I want to see what happens if I put this heat gun underneath of this lighter and just even though with pure heat without no flame no microwave no blowtorch nothing I just want see what happens so the way this is gonna work is I have this heat its own right now but it's not it the switch is all but it's not one on the hook to an extension cord that goes to the back of the garage so that way I can have it on here I can go to the back of the garage and just plug it in so in that way I started I can be away from I wonder where I started so let's go started three two [Applause] okay that was actually not very excitable so it looks like what you would looks like what happened is what you would expect to happen the just kind of heated up and bubbled and then shot out so let's try something else let's repeat that same thing but I have a candle I'm gonna light the candle and put a candle maybe maybe on top of it or maybe down here we'll see if we can catch the flame will take this paint can and we'll just sit this candle right here so hopefully whenever it wherever the heat gun makes the thing burst it'll burst all of all the beauty will come down hit the candle then go get our ball [Applause] that was Publix pretty much exactly what I wanted cruising the exact same thing as this one it just heated up and melted it and it bursted out it hit the candle exploded just like wanted to I was kind of getting worried because I was I thought maybe that it wasn't gonna just like burst and I'll rush out I'm just gonna get a tiny little pink oh and just sit here just burn but that worked perfect [Applause] that's no good tell them didn't go at all this one did exactly what I didn't want to have footage whatever they leak out I will not be satisfied until I see that was it just a fluke that that one one time it happened this time that we're going to double up and do two layers they were really empty so I guess that was a fluke so it just happened to be a fluke one the second time on the first time with the candle so that kind of sucks I really wanted to see that again let's move on to the next one alright so right after I turned the camera off it just hit me instead of using the heat gun and then try to get them to release all the butane into the candle why not just light the candle and then just put them on top of the candle so what we're gonna do light this candle what was it cool yeah bursted it in it but it blew the candle so alright I think it's time to bring out the blowtorch blowtorch have a lighter what would then I'm sure you're probably wondering how are you gonna hit this thing with a blowtorch and be a safe distance away put my blowtorch on a pole it's that way I can stand up all the way back here whenever I like it and something I don't usually do I'm gonna be wearing safety glasses alright so let's cut to the chase that was awesome I think Maidan always I didn't expect to make it as cold as you expect it's just a little tiny pinhole so let's do again that wasn't what I expected whenever it fell over the only reason I kept hitting it with the torch was I was hoping that it would do it shoot off but I'll take that all right I'll do one more let's hope this last ones are do [Applause] yeah I'll take that that's pretty good oh yeah that looks pretty good I'll give you guys are close by this because it looks so cool all right here you can see you can see the hole on this one where it all blew out all this plastic is right here and you can see the hole on this one which is right here and then this whole sides melted and this one right here you can see there's a little tiny hole right there alright so we've done quite a few tests here in the garage and stuff yeah we blow torch microwave all that kind of stuff and we've had some pretty cool reactions but let's move on to the grand finale all right guys and for our grand finale I present to you 14 you lighters stuck to a 2x4 why do you have 14 lighters stuck to a 2x4 it's a good question well as you just saw with the blowtorch what I'm gonna do I see how fast I can line off all 14 light all 14 of these lighters with this blowtorch just bang bang bang and it's gonna be our grand finale my safety glasses on all right well nevermind we're gonna take these outside all right after dousing these things in water I guess we'll call quits there who would have thought that would have got out of control oh well we got one one two three four five six now we got seven we got a hat on so obviously I'm not going to do the other half because I think I'm testing my luck enough for today so thank you so much for watching I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next one [Music] [Music]", "c33sE2_V2S0": "hey guys how are you doing it's harry here again so recently i bought something off wish i've never used wish before obviously i've heard good things and bad things [Music] uh yeah they had a few things on there that said limited quantity deal like one pound for like well all sorts of things that shouldn't be a pound and i tried to buy some but obviously i looked into it a bit more and it's one pound per for the first person to order it or something like that so you never get it and you have to get a refund then and go for all that so it's not very good for that for bargains but yeah i found this on there it looked quite interesting this little electric usb lighter now it was about two pounds something on there and then two pound delivery so i think it was roughly around four pound fifty i've paid for it it looked quite interesting it's supposed to have like it said fingerprint scanner but it's quite interesting it's got like a touch instead of a button it's like electric touch kind of thing i've used it a couple times it's quite bright as you can see there's like a metal coil at the top there turn around so you can see a bit better there i've used it a few times now and i have to say if i were using if you're going to use it quite a lot i think the metal coil is going to break eventually because it's just a flimsy bit of metal in there but yeah if i just i'll show you what i mean so just touch like that it gets hot and it reminds me of like a car cigarette lighter and then yeah that's quite instant quite quick i've had also in the past the electric other electric lighters that are kind of like a taser we got two prongs and the bit of electricity goes between them but with those i've noticed they're quite high pitch and make quite a lot of noise with this it obviously doesn't and yeah it's quite a nice little thing really four pound i think it's quite good on and off the only thing i do have to say is it is quite like that you have to once and that's it because you can just like double tap and it won't work but one tap will work yeah it's quite a funky little lighter early i think four pound fifty it's quite good i know a lot of people don't like disposable lighters because it's bad for the environment and what have you i think this would last a while if you used it correctly i have to say is when you do put a cigarette in it does push the metal out a bit so sometimes you have to turn it around and start pushing your cigarette in the other way yeah i've got a cigarette here so on and will it and it's easy as that so yeah quite a funky little lighter it also came with the charger cable not the plug but still for four pound i think it's quite a good deal it took about 20 days to get here which is fair enough yeah i think it's quite a futuristic kind of style little lighter for four pound like i said i think that will go in the future i think the metal will break and it will be non-functional if you take care of it i think it will last quite a long time and it might be quite handy to have so yeah there we have our little wish lighter fingerprint lighter i don't know if it's got a special name i think it's just an electric lighter but yeah there we have it anyway thank you very much for watching guys if you liked the video leave a like uh if you want to check out my other videos feel free to and if you want to subscribe please feel free to anyway hopefully i shall see you in the next video bye for now", "vIe_fNwWM-Q": "what's up buddy how you all doing today I'm gonna be testing out five different survival lighters and see which ones are the best hope this lighters doesn't come with the lighter fluid so make sure you're gonna go pick up some lighter fluid so each and one of the sliders are unique and awesome so let's test them out and see which one is the best let's check out this lighter first it's on a keychain pretty cool so what I'm gonna do is open it and fill up some lighter fluid and fill it up right here oops I might have put a little bit too much oh so I'm gonna close it just like that I'm gonna set it aside and we'll come back to it first I'm gonna fill all of them up so this one is a little cool check this out you're gonna pull it out it comes with a lighter and the keychain as well I'm gonna open it you see there is a little light just like that I like how small it is it's pretty similar to this lighter but it's actually twice smaller overall we're gonna open it it works a little different cause it has different flint you got this drum over here and you just like it but right now it's all empty so it's a little bit hard to get it out you need pliers but this lighter is easy just sounds good easy to take it apart so I'm gonna need pliers take it out pretty simple and then we're gonna just fill it up a little bit soak it in nice done doesn't take that much as you can see boom set it then we're gonna close it and we're gonna let it soak it in and come back to it and what else I like about this lighter it comes with this really cool waterproof case cell phone anything you can build your own survival kit and this one is a Zippo lighter ever buddy knows Zippo lighters ooh awesome lighters everybody loved them it says water resistance seal what a resistant means it's not under water it's means against Iranian stuff so if you drop it in the lake you're gonna have a problem with that lighter it's also says includes four tenders tax which is cool so that means you can start a fire four times not very sufficient lighter but let's check this out I'm sure if you're gonna go a bunch of replacements with you that'd be good but this is what it's supposed to look like I guess very cool design I like it lunch really easy to find if you lose it kind of closing a little bit tough so they all ready to go all you have to do is flop this out and strike it and it should get on fire we're gonna have to test out how long it's gonna burn for so we can start the fire it's actually really really cool I like that a lot and close it we'll come back to it later and the last lighter right here we got floating light so let's open it up see how it flames up so you have a little bottom to release it very cool right here and this one locks it up so so you can open it unless you release this lock and then press this one very cool and well that's looks like a little lighter what it does not come with gasps oh my god so this light I need some butane you fill it up over here which is I don't have it now but you know it's gonna make a little torch right here but what's cool about it is that is floating waterproof lighter creation so we're gonna test it out see if it's actually floats so what we do with this lighter is openness like this and it's like a much what we gonna do is grab it like that and stack it the Flint on the side here and whoa dois this is so cool keep away from here because if by mistake you get this fire into here the whole thing is gonna get on fire so make sure to be careful and let's start to blow it out really easy to blow it out this whole thing over here is a flint so that's actually super cool looks like I need to dip it in back in a lighter and stack it again boom easy wow that's so cool now it's time to strike this lighter and let's see if it's actually works and how it works you see layered armor here boom only one strike took me to get that lighter one look how little this letter is I think I can start a fire with that easy easy to blow it out put it back on ready to go now let's see if it's actually waterproof or not we got here part of water and what I'm gonna do is drop this if you drop this lighter it's gonna sink but hopefully gonna drop it not too deep but what's cool about this lighter if you gonna drop it in the water and it's too deep to leave it from underwater you don't have to worry about it cuz it's just gonna float I like that a lot and this one it says is whatever is distance so I'm not even gonna try to develop it in the water because it says it's not waterproof so it's only again cycling so if I drop it in the water it's gonna go get owned which is not as good as this lightest so as you can see this one floating pretty good let's take it out I'm gonna open it and see if there's any water inside of it nope no water we were happy with this lighter actually so now I'm gonna take off this lighter wipe it off on my t-shirt or whatever you got your hug I'm gonna open it up and strike it again and see if it's actually still works look at this no problem let's test this leo like out wipe it off on my shirt again let's see if it starts then come on here you go it started no problem pretty in first about this light as well but if I'm out of lighter fluid there's no way I can start this fire with this park like this why I like this lighter way better because the Flint is way bigger way more spark and now let's go to start how long this will be on so this is a very simple test you're gonna take it out take one out just like that there's three more left oh wow and then what you're supposed to do is fluff it up this piece side here just like this and then what are you supposed to do is go up your lighter like this the different right here and then I'm gonna just strike on it and it should get on fire come on here you go it's on fire now let's see how long it will be around for so looks like really easy to start a fire it's been burning for five minutes so far so what I like about this lighter you don't need any lighter fluid all you need is a little spark like that and you can get fire but only for four times and then you out all you got is a flint which is good too but not the best this lighter is awesome makes it a lot of fire really easy to start a fire it's waterproof but if you're out of lighter fluid you're not going to be able to start a fire as much this one it's floating so if you're gonna drop it in the deep water no problem you're gonna get it easily it's floating so you can get it out of the wood are really easy and it's a little torch I'm sorry I don't have butane to test it out but I'm sure it's gonna work really good if you are tough lighter fluid no biggie you can start a fire just like that what you can get bunch of magnesium on the table or whatever and strike it and get this little thin dough on fire really easily told my lighters need the lighter fluid so this will work for perfectly for tall my lighters really really need it so how it works its water soften stuff you're going to open it so it's open Center things like that looks like in four things just like this so first I'm gonna fill it up the two lighter fluid just like this it's actually holds quite a bit Wow we were happy with that and then I can put this on top and this is going on top of it so it does not get any spilled out wow you look happy with this little canister so whenever I'm out of the light fluid this one well this one and I'm sure there's plenty of the ones I have a lot more and a fuel canister so this will last a lot longer pretty awesome love this and guess what it's also waterproof so when I need to refill it I'm just gonna open this part open this part and just gonna fill it up whatever I need to fill it up just like this boom done in conclusion out of all of this unique survival lighters very cool designs one-of-a-kind for sure this one is a tube inner for sure because even if you out of lighter fluid it's okay you got a flint and you know you can start a fire the different pretty easily as well so but if you have lighter fluid inside of it even better really easy to start a fire it's waterproof it doesn't float in the water so you can put up a cork or something like a wine cook on that on this keychain and now it's gonna be floating as well so it's not gonna sink in the deep water so I think this is definitely my bean a lighter and this little K said here gonna come with apt stay together and I'm set to go for the fire emergency fire starter alright guys let me know what do you think I definitely love all the survival gadgets and definitely putting them in my bag out bag let me know in comments below which one your favorite lighter and I'll see you next time peace out", "S8uMMx0doDo": "hey everybody Nick here and today I got a review a quick little review for you of these two little guys these are two peanut style lighters I'm the county Campina excel in titanium by Mara tack and the new myth to Hill lighter I'm one quick note I don't smoke unless I'm on fire so I'm reviewing these little guys as everyday fire starting tools but they're only gonna see occasional use so I'm not doing a full review just something quick the good in the bad up and just a note the toe Hill here is about 23 bucks available at going gear and elsewhere and the peanut XL is 39 bucks in titanium but only 18 and a stainless steel available over at county con and you can get this guy in a couple of different sizes this is the XL but you have smaller and smaller versions so that's a nice thing so let's go on ahead and talk about the good and the bad of these guys and then little conclusion okay so first a quick little overview of how these work fundamentally they're both just little capsules and inside that capsules and insert you pour some lighter fluid into this section and then when you go to use it all you need to do is flip the little starter and it produces a candolyn well style flame that just stays there it stays lit then when you're done with it you either blow it out or you just put the cap on it and that'll put it out naturally but either way that's how these work and it's a beautiful thing because it is very very simple there's not much through these you can't go wrong with them particularly you know the only thing that you can do is you can run out of fill run out of fuel and you refill it or you need to put in a new Flint and they usually come with a new flood so problem solved case closed no issues um so that's nice next thing is because these guys have this little rubber o-ring here they're waterproof which is nice if you you don't have to worry about your pack getting wet or your pocket getting wet this is still gonna light up afterwards because no water got in there that seal is also a beautiful thing because it means that the fuel will take a long time to evaporate in a conventional Zippo silent sort of lighter I gather you get like a week or so out of the before the fluid dries up on this guy you got a lot long to people of revealing reporting something like six months and that's that's a beautiful thing but you don't even have to worry about it to think about it just refill it once a year when you go over this stuff that's in your pack so that's that's really really nice next thing is that there's less environmental impact is a disposable light of the size comparison and a quarter well I'm at it but with these guys you use it and then it runs out of fuel and then you throw it away there's plastic metals and never going anywhere again on this guy though if you run out of fuel all you need to do is well like I showed you pull this out pour some Zippo lighter fuel the Ronson all or whatever you want to use under there case closed problem-solve put it back together you're back in business there you go that's business right there I mean speaking of this sort of thing you'll note that you can use this as a candle just by standing it up like that it'll get pretty hot as he's doing that but it's kind of a beautiful thing um so that's nice another thing that I like about this is that the flame on it is very accessible compare that to some of the other light is out there whether if the flame is inside big wind gods and whatnot this guy you the flame is just sticking out this you can really bring it directly up to something and touch it to something which can be helpful for lighting certain things like for instance a Zippo hand warmer it's very nice to just be able to hold this directly to the flame and light it up no problem so that's that's nice I like the accessibility there and then finally I'm probably the thing I like most about this is that it actually requires both of these require active steps in order to make things flammable um if this is just in your pocket or in your pack it really can't accidentally catch fire I mean maybe if you like super overheated and it could do something but by and large this is a nut sort of block sitting in your pack until you actually take this off because remember fire needs air and there's no air in there until you well at least not enough and then you hit the striker fundamentally this is a nut kind of ish close enough until you take it out and take some active steps this is also nice because these sorts of light is if you just throw them in your pack it's very easy to accidentally depress this red button and then vent all the fuel out of the lighter so next time you go to use it you realize you've got yourself a hollow plastic body whereas with this guy again unless you unscrew this and take the active step to remove the cap that's not really gonna happen so that's a beautiful beautiful thing for me so there you go that's the good of these two he not style lighters they require active steps to make them flammable they're sealed up they waterproof accessible can be used as a candle Oh stupid child proofing less environmental impact and the vigeous symbol it's just an easy thing let's talk about the bed it's not all rainbows and unicorns you got some issues here Rob but you know that not too bad this guy even in titanium is a little bit on the heavier side you're looking at something like two 101.9 eight ounces versus 0.75 ounces for you disposable so you're paying a price and weight to carry this guy around it is also a little bit slower to get to and fire up I mean once you've got this out there's still a bit of a process to go from out to on fire and it's a lot quicker to just do something like that so that is a little bit of a process um it's probably not the best choice as a result if you need your light in ten times a day um and you know this guy particularly can occasionally take a little bit of work the light a couple of different strikes could be weird with gloves as well so there you go next issue there's no child proofing at all on this onion is badly any on these but if the kid gets all the bass he gets gonna let himself on fire don't let him get all of that just saying um it can also be hard to direct the flame into a very specific area because you kind of like I said the flame is just coming off of this wick it can be non-trivial to kind of put that wick in the right position to get to some things and so it's very much not gonna be able to get into a little hole in light anything up that's that's a problem there um because this is using lighter fluid the scent of lighter fluid will permeate your life is he using this I don't mind the scent so it's okay but that is a little bit ugly I'm a wind can be a bit of a problem unlike you know even your Zippo has this wind God around the the wick here um that can be a bit of an issue and then of course this will need to be refilled after sometime this can very much go dry see you can't just throw this in your car and expect it to work five years later you might get very lucky but chances are it won't work that way so that's the negative side it needs to be refilled every so often still the wind can be an issue you'll smell like lighter fluid um there are no childproofing features and it can be slow to get through it a little bit heavy on the conclusion sighs look I like these a lot I think it's a great way to have a controllable and low effort source of fire with you I mean sure you can carry a fire starting steal and whatnot but if you're in the lunchroom and you just need to light a candle for somebody's birthday or you need to you know light up your hand warmer on the way home I'll be reviewing this guy here soon um you know you're not gonna wanna build a pile of den there and be it and the fires deal with the back of your pocketknife this is just an easy way to get boring fire and it stays fueled way longer than a Zippo it's a lot more reusable and environmentally friendly than one of these guys than matches it's way more waterproof than matches and it's a lot more durable and packable than you standard disposable so if you need fire this is a convenient way to have it with you and either one of these works pretty well so uh there you go hope this has been interesting and that oh I don't know this lit a fire in your soul of the very best time so yeah anyways I'll probably be picking one of these guys up although probably the smaller sized and hope this has been interesting and have yourself a wonderful rest of your day bye now", "9kdSZthjOjA": "hey what's going on guys so we are continuing on the lighter uh videos these are all um you know jet flame lighter and uh these are ones that i've uh i've used a lot like a lot a lot four cigars over the years and i have them kind of in the order that i got them um this one is the oldest one it just says the pioneer on it i have no idea when i got this or where i got it but i know i've had this very very very long time i thought it was really cool you know back in the day there is a little you know clear part on the bottom so you can kind of see your fill level uh for your butane fuel um this one has a safety feature where you have to push let me zoom in here for you so you see this you can see push here so when you push there it pops that open on the back but you have to keep you have to keep pressure on that otherwise the button won't go down again for safety so it doesn't just you know leak a bunch of fuel or turn on an accident so you push forward to open it and then as you're pushing forward you come down and then you have your your flame all right very cool very effective and uh again very used for many many years i'm not sure who even makes this um and that's this one as well i don't know who makes this this is not branded or marked anywhere but had this one for a while as well top pops open with authority here i think and uh it has a push button on the side all right very easy to use this one has uh the red flame okay so there's a little piece of metal little ball of metal there forget what what uh what metal actually creates that reaction where you have a color flame but really easy to use all right and again use this for a while my issue with this is that the the lid although it opens very nicely has a good hinge on it i wish it opened more i don't like the fact that it's kind of close to the flame so this is one that again for cigars i would end up using it on this angle you know to toast and stuff but it's just hard because it's kind of blocking you know but this one got a lot of use so i figured i'd throw it in the video as well and then eventually i got into this one which is labeled bugatti um and i can tell you that that means absolutely nothing it's not like you know the car company is making these lighters it's just something that the chinese company who made this slapped on it thinking that was cool like oh yeah everyone loves bugatti they'll buy her later so yeah i i doubt there's any relationship whatsoever with bugatti um so this one was really cool and i liked about this is that this had the uh two punches on the side all right so this is great for cigars we have a small punch cutter and a larger punch cutter i've used these a lot like a lot a lot um the only thing is you know you have to be careful with these that have punch cutters they're integrated you don't want to just hold it like this and push the cigar and put pressure on the back because it'll just break the hinge these are you know they're cheap layers so you'd have to put this you know for me i'd put it down on a hard surface or i would just hold the side here like this and make sure it's stable so as you're putting pressure on it it's not pulling back because that will eventually break um but yeah it's been good you have to manually push that lid open all right and then same thing you have a side button all right but very effective flame very nice holds ton of fuel so it just works really well and the last one here which is the best one um and then once i got this one i didn't use these as much i still use this one these kind of got retired but this one also has some punches on the side just different style this one is made by vector all right and i'm a huge fan of vector lighters in general they're like anywhere from like i don't know 15 20 bucks only up to like 40 or 50 depending on you know which lighter but they tend to be a little bit better quality they're not like amazing or anything i do have some vector lighters that kind of crap down on me over the years but at least it's a name brand you can go to you know i mean they're they actually have models so you can find them but anyway on this one you can see there's a small punch and large punch same thing these do go all the way out though to 90 degrees which is nice and what i'll tend to do is i'll put my finger on the back for stability then i'll take my cigar and do my little my punch cut like that we have a small one then we have a larger diameter which is really nice and this one is very cool because it has a triple flame push the button on the side and these doors open let me zoom in a little detail on this alright so as you're pushing in the doors are open you can see the triple burners there all right and then we have that triple flame what's really nice about this extremely consistent okay no issues with uh you know too many misfires or anything like that but what's nice with the designs you can see it literally makes a wall of fire all right it makes it very easy to toast cigars and stuff all right awesome and even though you have three flames there and you're going through a fuel there's still a large you know capacity for fuel just like the uh the bugatti one so yeah just uh some some cool layers use i'll use all these for uh cigars again for years and i love them so you don't have to spend a whole lot of money you know getting a a decent lighter that works i mean sometimes it's cheap one you get from a gas station if it works it works it doesn't matter what brands on there it really doesn't as always it's serving a purpose but yeah i just want to share these with you these were probably you know some of my most used butane lighters for uh for cigars so that's it for now hopefully you guys have a wonderful day thanks for watching let me know down in the comment section if you carry it later what lighter do you carry always curious uh but yeah that's it for now hopefully you have a great day and i'll see you guys tomorrow with a brand new video thanks for watching take care", "9P_lkDs93DQ": "[Music] [Laughter] [Music] welcome back to gentleman's point guys my name is David today I have a review for you and the review which I will be doing is pipe lighters and cigar lighters and any other kind of lighter or flame related material you can think of within reason related to pipes and cigars so today I'm gonna take you through just a few of the different kinds of lighters that I think are the best and worst for lighting your various forms of tobacco I'm gonna start off with the one that everybody knows because everybody has access to it because everybody has seen one in their time whether it was somebody lighting a cigarette or lighting candles on a birthday cake and that is the classic bic lighter so this is the lighter that you can get at a drugstore at a gas station pretty much anywhere it's very basic it's got butane and a flint wheel you do that and it lights up and it's all pretty and sparkly so this is a very basic lighter it does come in a couple of different sizes so you can get a larger one you can get a smaller one like that still just as big a flame actually so which is nice these lighters go for anywhere between two and four dollars a pop at your local gas station or convenience store you can get them in multi packs you can get them in just about any kind of color or pattern you can think of which is very nice however this is where the caveat comes him the problem with these is you can burn yourself really really easily if you're trying to light a pipe and I'll just grab a pipe real quick to demonstrate for you what I'm talking about so if you have your pipe and you're holding it in your jaw and you light your lighter unless you're holding it at an angle like this if you do it like that you're gonna burn your your finger the other problem about these is they are disposable but they're not refillable now they are cheap enough that it's not really a problem that they're not refillable but if you have one that you really really like it can be a problem the other problem with these they're not wind proof which for anyone like me who smokes outside that can be a problem these are great for pipes if you're indoors but they're not great for cigars a cigar takes so long to light using a soft flame that by the time that you get this or this time you get your cigar lit this part on it this metal shield around the around the emitter is gonna be so hot you almost can't put it down you can't touch it you can't do anything with it your thumb is gonna get tired from holding it so I prefer not to use bic lighters in general I keep them around just in case I literally don't have anything else to use but I prefer other forms of liars now keeping in the BIC family of product is this lighter and this I got from my local brick and mortar this was about seven dollars and it is just a beefed-up thick that has an offset so that when you're lighting your pipe your finger is further away from the flame which is really really nice now the other benefit about this is it is refillable most pipe in cigar shops have these again good for pipes not so good for cigars but usually it works and it's got a pretty long lifespan because it is refillable now we're gonna get into a more popular form of lighter which is something sort of like this this is a click lighter this is the one that everybody thinks of when they think of a pipe lighter other than maybe the IM corona old boy style pipe lighters this is what everybody gets when they're ready to upgrade this is this particular one is a jet line but I know that several other makers make this style of lighter I've had this for about a year now and when I am in my home or when I'm at my local brick-and-mortar it is a great lighter or at least it was much like Bradley over at stuff and things I have had trouble with it lighting you saw him when I first lit it up it doesn't always light anymore and it it drives me nuts this one was about twelve dollars and so it's not a huge investment but I was hoping for more out of it the style of lighter is called a piezo lighter and it's just a fancy way of saying it's a click lighter you can get these in several different styles this one is one I got in Las Vegas where you slide the top of the chip and it lights there's another version I have here that I will show you from my personal collection this is one that I bought while I was in Tokyo so it's got a very nice castle on it if you flip it up it opens up and I haven't filled it but it would light if I had filled it so there you go that's the benefit of this style of lighter is you can get it in multiple kinds of designs so it's it's fun it's quirky again good for pipes not for cigars now we get into lighters that are good for pipes excuse me pipes and cigars so what we have here this is a classic Zippo and I'm saving torch lighters for last if that's what you're watching this video for so this is a classic Zippo this one was $15 I believe this is the brushed nickel finish so it's got a very nice look to it so as you can see it's got the standard Zippo chimney on it what I love about Zippos is they always always light unless they're out of fluid it's just so long as you remember to fill it every couple of days these things are workhorses now what I like about the Zippo is it is a classic design and it's wind proof this is the biggest issue I have always had with pipes and cigars is I predominantly smoke outside so I need something that's wind proof originally I had gotten this guy because I was hoping if I angled it down into the bowl it would knock out some of the wind resistance but it didn't so what I instead did was I got this this is another Zippo and this is the Zippo pipe lighter now what is so nice about this one is it has a pipe hull so it actually will allow you to light your pipe without damaging the rim of your bowl if you're trying to use a classic Zippo to light a pipe the problem is once you put it in its gonna have to bend over the chimney and that can cause damage to the rim of your bulb so it's great about this is I can get it open you can hold it directly over the bowl and not damage the rim of your pipe now I have also found that Zippos are great for lighting cigars you do get some of the Zippo fluid taste in the first few puffs but it's not going to taint your entire bowl or your entire cigar for that matter really that is the primary complaint that I've heard about Zippos is people complain about the fact oh I don't like the taste of the the pipe or of the the fluid in my cigar or in my pipe and I just think those statements are a little overrated I think people are a little oversensitive about it because they're used to butane lighters so but a Zippo is a perfectly fine way to light your pipe or cigar now if you want to go the butane route you can get an insert where you can take this out and put in a butane insert from a company called Thunderbird hmm they sell their products on Amazon and it is a butane insert with a pipe lighter chimney on it now I have also heard complaints about this that the Thunderbird insert tends to leak so you fill it up with butane and then all of a sudden you have no butane left two or three days later because the latch gets stuck that actually feeds the the butane out through the the nozzle so that does it for soft flame and like I said the Zippos are great this one is a great bargain this Zippo is the matte black pipe lighter I got it for 10 dollars on Amazon I'll put a link to that in the description box below so you can go purchase yourself one I highly highly recommend them now what everyone else has been waiting for all you cigar smokers we have the torch lighter this is a budget torch lighter that I bought from my local brick and mortar for about 15 dollars this is a Colibri Firebird this is a three torch I know if you can see that it's got a really nice torch flame on it so I can light up a cigar with this in nothing flat I absolutely love this lighter its refillable the flame is adjustable which is really nice so it is a workhorse it has never failed me and it's wind proof so if you're out smoking outdoors I like a fast light if I'm lighting a cigar I tend to use a Firebird now if I'm in a brick-and-mortar I may or may not use a torch lighter on a cigar I tend to find the tobacco tastes better when it's lit at lower temperatures so let me just show you the classic example here the classic example of how to light a pipe or cigar is matches granted this is a pipe match so it is much much shorter and what you would use on a cigar butt matches burn and I believe it's like four or five hundred degrees something like that whereas a soft flame lighter and it doesn't matter whether you're burning butane or fuel will burn anywhere from five to six hundred degrees so you're looking at you know roughly 400 450 600 something like that Breyer starts burning around 800 degrees this burns at about 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit so do not use a torch lighter on your briar you will burn out the bowl you will destroy your pipe it will not be fixable this is a fact of life as much as you think this is convenient to light a pipe it is not you will ruin your pipe doing that if you want to do that deal with a corncob or something cheeping throw away afterward so there you have it I like I said I have used all of these lighters and all of them have their merits all of them have their problems the BIC lighters and this you know larger click wheel lighter they have the benefit that they are cheap readily available they're convenient you can keep 10 or 12 of them around for not a whole lot of money but at some point they do run out of butane and you can't see when they're about to run out of butane because they have an opaque casing and they're not refillable so you're always kind of gambling with that and you have the potential to burn the bejesus out of your fingers so positives and negatives the jet line this style of pipe lighter it's good if you're indoors this this is not gonna stand up to any kind of wind at all and after a period of time they do tend to break down and you can send them in for service but I mean for the price that you pay for them it's not really worth it zip o's have withstood the test of time since their creation they've got both the regular and pipe lighter inserts and so long as you remember to fill them they will always light you never have to refire them and they will last you a lifetime if you take care of them jet lighters the Firebird by Calibri the jet line lighters about I think it's a sigh car and of course there are you know multiple upgraded versions of these lighters all work phenomenally but they are not for pipes so there you have it just a few kind of descriptions of some of these products and what you can and can't use them on some of the positives and negatives if you would like to purchase any of these products I'll try to throw some links down in description mmm into the description box below at least for the Zippos and the jet lighters the torch lighters so but other than that that's all I've really got for you today

corner I hope you're having a good day and other than that have a great one [Music]", "-JCqbYVp34o": "got it here five more weird lighters start with this one look at that how does it come out I think it has a little magnet so it turned out to be one of those reaching torches doesn't have a lighter fluid but does it like in no it doesn't have a magnet it just locks in perfectly in here okay let's get some butane oh look there's a little flush like - so that's kind of cool everyday care lighter okay I feel it this park is going but why is it not like you're not let's adjust it a little bit - plus maybe - and you gotta put it on smallest - light it up then make it higher if you need it higher and you can put on smallest again so it works best whenever you put a smaller setting but you're very unique lighter the quality of light up could be way better okay next one there's a brand of it wow this is unique okay looks like it's torch light are easy to adjust the flame let's just fill it up okay what's in here ooh nice so you just turn it and then oh you have to hold it or you can lock it in cool and then you can adjust the flame I just filled it up that's why it's being a little bit crazy and I like how it's a blowtorch and then you can release it and stop it it works way better this is definitely very unique one even though it's new you can lock it in you can hold it lock it in and adjust the flame at any point this is will be the MUX this is will be the list will looks like with the list it stops I like how it is so easy to work with very very cool light all right here tells you when it's on or off I guess that means is off and that means it's on and then just light it boom wow that's a cool lighter looks like I have a whole bunch of lighters by the same plant that was my favorite don't looks like oh it's already filled nice how do we adjust that for the flame cool shut it off oh look how there's a regular spark out here usually has a lip tonic one a lot that you can spark a look at that torch beautiful flick it and it will shut off Kate what is this oh this is a thing cigar cutter and here you can adjust it with a big screwdriver or one of this multi-tool looks like it's ready to go where's the + on - it doesn't tell me I just died okay I adjusted for perfect flame it doesn't have it this huge flame and then flick it super easy one more time love it so you are very easy to adjust to beautiful lighter I should try to find more light us that this burn makes this is a very unique light I think I already put to the test one like that with a leather casein this one has this very very unique I don't even know what color of that but what's so special about this it has this hand whoo this one is a little bit different there you go you got flicky better they go so the idea of it it's like vintage easy to looks like I feel it and grab the same screwdriver to adjust the flame but you want to flick it all the way boom and it will spark the arm will spark the lighter the flink you see it so very very slowly we grab this arm pull on it illicit young wok keep going till it's lights up probably need to adjust the flame another torch lighter Wow I guess this video should be called very very unique like you never seen before torch light us I think it's out of gas but makes sense right it works I'm not going to feel it for now but well now we're gonna be using it I definitely going to feel it very very nice light action never put that one to the test I thought something similar but not like that that is storage okay a little bit different burnt over here let's see what this one does a while it's not a torch lighter but let's try to feel it that's okay one can be non touch lighter it just saw metal lighter that's it that kind of has a flame sideways like that but what happens when we spin this thing doesn't have plus or minus no it does this was a plus whoa that might as well be a torch lighter look at that without having a torch just a flame easy to adjust that you see right here and what's so cool about this like that it's all metal fully metal lighter look at this explosion of a flint bubbly the most epic Flint I ever seen look at that you could probably start the fire with just this Park whoever makes this flint should make fire strikers that's insane I'm Anna seem impressed by the Flint than the lighter but yeah very unique kind of torch lighter but let me know in comments below about this thing pretty awesome yeah [Music]", "RMkT8KNIRkU": "[Applause] [Music] hi I'm Andrew Nagy associate editor of Cigar Aficionado magazine and I'm here to show you how to light a cigar here we have a torch lighter these are great for lighting a cigar outside inside they're great too because they have a very accurate flame the only downside is is that that flame is also very hot so you have to be pretty good about how you light your cigar or you may singe it torch lighters come in a variety of options you have single flame lighter but then you also have a double and a triple flame which are good for lighting larger cigars the key to lighting a cigar with the torch flame lighter is you want to strike the torch first then you want to bring the cigar just above the flame because remember this thing is very hot he's shot on the outsides you work your way towards the middle and as you see that sherry start to develop give the end a couple blows and you have a lit cigar this is a soft flame lighter the most common lighter you will see on the market these are great for lighting a cigar inside with a little bit more control but outside it can be a bit difficult as the wind wreaks havoc on its flame for myself and a few other editors here at cigar aficionado we do prefer the soft flame as it's just a very simple controlled easy way to light your cigar bring the cigar gently over just slowly rotate the cigar you want to begin on the outside edges and you just kind of rotate through then you want to gently move the flame towards the center when you see that a little gray maybe some of that char showing up kind of want to just maybe blow on the end and when you have a nice enough cherry stem to take a drug and here we have the simple wooden match creates a nice soft flame it's great for lighting indoors again wind rains not gonna allow you to use this outside the wooden matches a nice old-school method to light your cigar during your cigar slowly above the flame and like all the other lighting methods you want to slowly rotate starting with the edges and rotate that cigar this is why you also use long wooden matches because it gives you a longer time to light the cigar as opposed to cheap book matches seeder spills are great for inside as the soflam is controllable makes it nice elegant way to light a cigar however outside it's gonna be very difficult to light your smoke as the wind or rain just gonna make it ineffective a cedar spill is a great option when you have a lighting source that may impart all flavors such as a candle charcoal grill or a lighter that takes fluid you first need to light the spill and you want to bring your cigar over to the flame start with those edges and you work your way towards the middle don't be afraid to take a puff you'll notice with the cedar spill the flame tends to dance and jump a little bit it forces you to take your time and that's kind of the romantic [Music] you", "KAZ0-Muia6Y": "hey guys summer is finally here for me I'm sorry I've been gone about the last month but the last month of school was a super intense time for me work wise so I just had to take some time off well I'm here today to talk to you about a problem that I have and no not based on the title it's not smoking that I have a problem with the problem I have is with crummy lighters it's a guy who's been collecting gear for over a decade I have constantly run into the problem of cheap garbage lighters in fact I just went around and and tried to find all these examples of junky letters that that I have lying around and I just have tons of all broken lighters mostly butane lighters which are more difficult to keep running admittedly but I think that I've finally found some letters that I think will be permanent usable keepers in my collection and I'm going to show three that I really like today this is the accomplice trench lighter this is the Douglass filled out lighter and this is classic Zippo in brass and what you're gonna find in this video is that there's a clear winner even amongst these three as I show them all to you I get all three of these letters from urban everyday carry supply and when I first got them I've had them for about three months I had to admit that I thought okay so this is mostly just a matter of taste they're all quality lighters you know the these the Zippo lighters for the guy who just wants a classic hot rod the accomplished lighters for the guy who kind of wants something more whimsical and then the Douglass lighters they'll get one for the guy who likes quality but actually in real-world testing I have a clear winner and in this video I'm gonna be talking about that I'm gonna show you how all three of these letters work obviously they're you know simple but I'm going to talk about some of their quirks and some of the things that set them apart and and I think you'll also see why I clearly have a favorite when we get to the end of this so so please stay tuned and if you're interested in any three of these letters the links listed down below thanks a lot for watching and I hope you enjoyed this comparison let's start with my third choice in this group this is the accomplice trench lighter and the idea of this letter is that it's sort of a whimsical steampunk design that is actually a recreation of a letter that was used in World War one hence the trench letter name and the idea is is that there's this brass core which is really sturdy it's a nice heavy letter but around it is this stainless steel sheath that slides up and down on these little miniature rails that create a little windshield for it and also that's how you put it out yeah it's a very fun design if you're into kind of offbeat style in your EDC it would be a great choice for that you can't operate it one-handed as I'll show you here the truth is though is that most of the time when I gave this letter to people they had no idea how to use it and so I ended up just having to explain over and over again what it was how it worked that kind of thing not exactly the kind of conversation you want to have when you're trying to get cigars lit and so I found that I was not using this very much it also doesn't hold fluid any longer than a Zippo which is a big negative for me well the accomplice later has some interesting history being a throwback to a world war 1 letter no one can doubt the 80 years of provenance with the classic Zippo lighter of course these letters made famous in World War two but really are the standard mass-produced letter being made by Zippo since 1932 they are legendary you can get Zippos everywhere at gas stations and they're highly collectible which is why this almost took the first place spot because for most guys who are in the lighters you're going to be collecting Zippos at some point and this fire fighter is an interesting exclusive with urban EDC supply it's a beautiful brass lighter and it is high polished great engraving little curious that firefighter is spraying towards the truck but you know maybe he's afraid of his fire truck I don't know but the the uniqueness of this lighter with this specific engraving and then also obviously the fact that Zippo lighters are so legendary and you're able to do so much with Zippo say you don't like Zippo fluidy and don't like the traditional construction you can switch it over to a butane of course the experience of you know flipping a Zippo and keeping it up and running is just you know something that happens for generations well at any rate I did end up using this later a lot but but for the $55 price tag which is what it is from urban everyday carry supply it just didn't stand out to me enough which brings me to the Douglas field el l\u00edder which wow what a lighter I wish I had not been in denial about the greatness of this letter for so long the Douglas field L by comparison is a new design that is coming from Japan and what it is also bringing from Japan is that exceedingly high level of build quality and finishing that we've come to expect from quality Japanese EDC goods this easily is as nice as some of the high-end Japanese knives that you sometimes see coming through and it's got an incredible machining and detail throughout in fact they claim that it is constructed to triple lot tolerances it's a very carry bull weight and in with the L design there's a flip lock mechanism that is how you operate this lighter my experience with this handing it to every guy that I was having a cigar or a pipe with in the last three months is this was the showstopper in brass in particular it's got a great weight it's got a beautiful knurling beautiful construction it's a pleasure to use and as long as you keep it fueled up it keeps his fuel it doesn't run out which is so frustrating with zip what's in particular and this is really one of the reasons why it's in front of the Zippo for me you'll notice it's got great engravings it even has a serial number on the side I don't know if he caught that and then just the actual striker mechanism on it is just such a pleasure so tactile and the top flips up and that's also how you put it out by far it's favorite design and a lighter ever and it's built like a tank I can't recommend it enough okay there you have it the Douglas filled out lighter is the best not only just for retaining fluid which is so important with these old Zippo fluid lighters but also just for the the incredible craftsmanship the reliability of the design and just the touches that make it feel special so please let me know in the comments below what your letter of choice is if you're new to the

welcome make sure you subscribe hit that bell hit the notification park and you won't miss an upload make sure you thumbs up this video go check out my other videos once again welcome so um i got these lighters here from roses express i don't know if anybody have a roses or not but these are just some cheap lighters uh content in a pack with an extra lighter in there so they're like living and i am using shipping label paper to do the prints with so you can get this from walmart for no more than like five or six dollars things like four 489 somewhere but you go to walmart make sure you get the full sheet you got to be the four sheet right here and then this is the number that you would look for 15 26 5. okay so um i already got images of my choice which i all i did was google uh limarito labels but like labels stuff like that and the sizing for the labels are 2.45 width 2.45 height for this lighter in particular now when it comes to bigs and all that kind of stuff i have another video you can go check that out i got the measurements for the big lighters in that one like i said this here is a transfer uh trans um hyzer transfer tape um shelf lining tape whatever you want to call it i got this from walmart i use this a lot in a lot of my videos some y'all might know some y'all don't you can get this from walmart up in the kitchen area where you buy all the contact paper the chef lining paper stuff like that this is no more than like six dollars i got this one out of walmart so all it is is a transparent tape before y'all say what's the clear stuff i'm using this is what i'm using my image is already cut out i use my qriket design space to design it and get the size and i need it so i cut it with my cricut machine and i did not use the transfer tape like i should have if for some reason it gives me a hard time you can go ahead and cut your transfer tape before you cut your images on your cricut design especially gonna cut it to where it fits only inside the black square and it will cut it but sometimes it gives me a hard time so i'd rather do it by hand so let's get started so i'm just gonna get my ladder and i'm going to give you some transfer tape and i'm going to try to cut it the best way i know how there's two inches and i don't need it to be perfect i just use the transfer tape to give it like a gloss look or a waterproof look for when it's like um going to be in water or something like that so all i do is measurement like that and i pulled it back and off of it and it gives you this clear tape so all i'm going to do is place it down on my image my image is already cut so that's why i'm not really tripping so i'm just going to smooth it so all you got to do now is cut the excess so all you do now is you put the tape on there you get your tape down real good cut the excess up and then you pull and it is it's already got a backing on it that part came up this part didn't so you will have to pull it so that's what i'm going to do now i'm just going to pull the backing off and it should look like this gonna cut another excess of the tape off because i want it to just look like even okay i'm gonna do now lay my ladder down get it to where i want it to be yeah once you put this shipping label down yeah i better make sure it's where you need it to be because if not it will come um it will leave like a residue or paper residue on it so yeah and i'm doing is rolling it this is what it looks like it's my first one so we're just going to repeat the steps on pretty much all of them ain't no sunshine in these city not for me 22 years old [Music]  i can't tell so i'm glad to know cause i ain't gonna snitch on me and i ain't feeling jealous i went raised this way just the way i were born into a life but thug

plastic and it says walter replica i guess ppk call 765 millimeter but yeah i have to put this one away and hide it because i don't want it kids get to", "ibYf7YdBcFM": "welcome to the average male channel where we might get older but we never grow up according to my mom that is exactly right today we are going to be putting to the test some lighters that I bought from Amazon that will replace the common bic lighter now the Bic lighter might only cost a couple dollars but the problem with them is they run out of butane real quickly they get really hot around the top your thumb will eventually get pretty gruff right here and if you lend them to somebody to go start a campfire or something they put them in their pocket never to be seen or heard from again and then you have to go ask your friends who's the light of thief so let's get to it let's check out some of these awesome lighters both oil as well as butane that I have found on Amazon now the first letter I have up is a butane lighter and look at how cool this is I mean think of you pulled this out of your pocket to show your friends or give it to somebody to start a campfire with versus a big ladder you give them the big lighter it can hurt your thumb gets hot but this butane lighter just look at it it has sex appeal thumbs not gonna get it beat up it's refillable from the bottom you can turn it up or down to make you adjust your flame so this is really cool let's fill it up and see how well it works I like using this premium lighter fluid special blue European fluid and one of the reasons is because it comes with all of these attachments we'll use this one the lighter one of the ways we know if it's a quality lighter is if a lot of fuel comes out and we always go upside down and now it's full and you can see how much butane you have in the lighter right here on the side there's a little window and I think that's really cool because you always know exactly where you're at and look at that first time we have a jet I don't know if you can really see the Jetta might need to turn the lights down I'm gonna turn it up let's turn it all the way up see how big this check goes oh look at that oh it's hot so look you take this you show this to your friends pull this out of your pocket you have a big jet or you just have your BIC which one would you choose I like this one I think that this one is really cool let's see what else we have we have more cool lighters and this one even after that flame that jet flame it's still not hot I could put up my pocket right away and it's not gonna burn anything okay what else do I have the next one is an oil-based lighter and if you're giving this one there's a present look at this box it has a great presentation when it comes out always extra Flint's a brush to get rid of any dust or debris the kids around the wick and this was my favorite lighter when I saw this one I knew that this was gonna be my favorite lighter so I actually put this one to the test for a week so I actually already took it out and filled it up but could use a little more oil after a week it's been in my pocket my pocket didn't smell like kerosene a lot of times if you have a Zippo lighter and it's in your pocket it'll end up smelling like kerosene and this one again one handy see that how cool is that one-handed and it lights it's not lighting every time and so I know it's getting low on oil so input oil on it take the back off has a rubber gasket around there to keep the oil in and so one thing when you fill this up with oil it has a really big opening called a little on the sides and they're ready to go one thing I have found with this slider after you fill it up put it this way if you put it this way it gets the wick wet and it also gets the Flint wet and there you go bigger flame [Music] when it does get dust from the magnesium in the Flint you can clean it like that fix the wick and you're back in business the best thing about this when it's in your pocket this won't go up keeps the flame covered and it actually takes a lot of pressure to push on that so you actually have to engage this in order to lift it and it won't lift up in your pocket ouch you have to push really hard on the spring to get it going so I think this is my overall favorite mitre because it looks so sophisticated no matter what though tell me what you think do you like to jet flame butane or the oil lighter classic trench lighter I think they're both better than the BIC sore thumb one-handed operation one-handed operation let me know in the comments click and subscribe if you like this I'll keep making these videos and this one sometimes you have to adjust the butane to keep it going as well found just in this video this one every single time how cool is that smothers the flame lights are right back up let me know what you think which one do you like better if you enjoy watching these videos as much as I have fun make it now make sure you hit like make sure you comment and subscribe and I will see you next time", "Ck7rf4l4-0o": "hey what's going on guys today I'm going to show you how to turn your regular cheap lighter into a jet lighter super simple let's get right into it alright to make this jet lighter you need a you need a lighter obviously a cheap lighter and you need a needle so take your pliers and you want to take this cover off just like that guess and how you wanted your needle and just jump in this hole okay so now you want to grab the sharpie and just make a line just a little bit higher than the nozzle just like that take your pliers just cut that in [Music] that [Music] grab your lighter [Music] put the new back in this hole and want to push on it don't push too hard just at now your pliers you want to squeeze the nozzle so it doesn't come out just a bit and now your jetliner is ready let me show you how it works so all you've done is you made the hole smaller right now there's more pressure coming out of the hole so you have to adjust the pressure a little bit higher and should be good and now you have a jet lighter I'll show you okay so you guys remember the regular wire just your regular lighter this is your deadline and if you can hear up [Music] till figures subscribe like this video and comment down below and I'll see you guys next time peace [Music]", "hsxk2afliA8": "[Music] welcome to the urban survivor channel and in this video we're going to be taking a look at the dissim lighter which is a high powered circle grip everyday carry lighter that can be used right side up or upside down before we get to unboxing the dyson lighter and lighting a nice fire be sure to hit the like button and subscribe to the channel for more videos like this one first of all i want to thank dissim who sent out the slider and a few other items to the channel for review dissom originally raised over 330 000 on kickstarter from over 7000 backers to help make this product a reality and if you want to pick one up you can do so using the link in the description below they also sent over a nice little water resistant zippered case for the lighter it's a great way to store and protect the lighter the dissim lighter is 3.53 inches long and 1.8 inches wide and it weighs just over three ounces making it ideal for everyday carry use these lighters ship empty so you need to pick up some butane before you use it to fill it up all you need to do is make sure that it's depressurized set the dial to low press it up against the butane container for five seconds and then wait a few minutes to let the gas settle and it's ready to go once it's filled up it's really easy to use all you have to do is hold the lighter at any angle you're comfortable with and click the button with your thumb you can easily adjust the size of the flame by adjusting the large dial on the side the dial gives you a lot of options from a tiny little flame all the way up to a huge powerful flame this is a quick comparison of some of the most commonly available lighters on the bottom left we have a standard bic style lighter which gets hot quickly and the flame doesn't have much range to it to the right we have a france 98 world cup zippo lighter which lights really easily but again the flame is not very powerful at least compared to the dissim lighter on top we have a long barbecue lighter which is pretty powerful and it has a decent reach but it's really long and bulky compared to the rest of the lighters finally we have the dissim lighter and as you can see it's the most powerful and has the longest range and it's also very compact compared to the barbecue lighter so now we're going to put the slider to the test and see how well it lights up a stick of fat wood and then see if we can get a little fire going in my solo stove for those of you that don't know fatwood is a resin soaked piece of wood that's used to make fire starting easier as you can see this piece of fat wood is catching really quickly and we're going to have a nice little fire going in my solo stove in no time for those of you that like backpacking and survival gear you should really check out the solo stove which is a compact wood gasifier stove that i'm using to build this fire it's great for boiling water and it runs on little bits of wood you don't really need to carry around any fuel canisters and as long as there's more around you pretty much have an unlimited source of fuel as expected the dyson lighter did a great job getting the fatwood started and it's excellent for getting a small fire going [Music] the only downside i noticed when using the slider is that sometimes it can take a few clicks to get it to light but i've had this problem with other lighters in the past as well it's also relatively large compared to a lot of lighters but the trade-off is the ability to light bigger fires and store more fuel with regards to the pros having a nice large dial makes it easy to have precise control over the size of the flame and another thing i notice is that the lighter doesn't really get too hot when in use like a normal bic lighter or zippo would the lighter also produces a really powerful flame which makes fire starting really easy and it also feels great in the hand and has an awesome design it's really nice to be able to light at any angle that you're comfortable with overall i was really impressed by the slider and for now it's going to rest in my get home back if you're looking for a high-powered edc lighter then this is definitely one to consider if you want to learn more

survivor channel for more videos like this one oh", "81WpN2xtb4s": "i just wanted to pre-face this video by saying i do not encourage nor condone the use of cigarettes or weed or anything similar to that and if you're under the age of 18 you can get out of my channel right now um but i'm going to go ahead and get the video started make sure to like and subscribe of course and enjoy thank you alrighty so today i'm going to be smoking a newport red cigarette and talking a little bit about what the best lighter is is it a zippo is it a bic what kind of lighters are the best but i think without further ado i'm going to go ahead and get this lit up and uh start the video so let's get it and in my opinion this does not come down to opinion most of the time when i'm talking about what's the best cigarette when i'm talking about like what's the best way to smoke or something like that it always comes down to opinion but this time this is fact fact based this is not opinion based and the thing with this is that bicks do not work very well in wind and that's why i've been using my zippo now zippos are quote unquote windproof with the base uh insert however what i have in here is a butane insert now don't get me wrong i love my butane insert i love my zippo however there are a few problems with that too the butane insert it works great in the wind so does the normal zippo but the normal zippo it runs out of fuel every three days and you have to fill it up every three days that gets annoying after a while especially for somebody who just likes to grab their lighter and go kind of thing my butane i've had my butane in here for three or four months now i'm doing pretty good um but that's what i like but the good thing about butane is that it's wind resistant i can use it however windy it is does not matter i can use it and it's going to work either way and a normal zippo insert will do about the same thing too um a normal zippo insert will work when it's windy but not when it's super windy it says it's wind resistant but i'll be completely honest maybe it was just mine but it was not particularly wind resistant uh it would work when it was slightly windy out but not when it was like really really breezy um but it's still better than a bic a bic doesn't work at all i'm sitting here with a bic when it's windy trying to light it like five different times and sorry that just turned on trying to light it like five different times and it doesn't work and for that reasoning i'm gonna have to go with a zippo is the best lighter however however there are some problems with the zippo as well man this is good uh the problem with my butane insert is that it's not very good for lighting cigarettes this is great for bangers not so great for cigarettes because and i don't think you can see the flame but i'm gonna go ahead and do it the flame yeah you can't see it the flame right here is a little bit too much for the cigarette so if i accidentally light a different if i accidentally light it like up here kind of thing when i'm first lighting my cigarette it'll burn off a good amount of the cigarette and i'm sure you've noticed that in a couple of my videos where i accidentally burn off a little bit of my cigarette which is not a big deal to me but it's still annoying you know what i'm saying it causes the cigarette to canoe it's just kind of annoying you know what i'm saying but yeah that's pretty much my answer i do think that a zippo with a butane insert is the best lighter um that's my opinion however your opinion can be different but this is fact based of course because it works in the wind it's gonna work all the time and uh it doesn't run out of fuel easily which is really really nice uh i do quite like disposable layers one of the downsides of this lighting sorry it's getting a little bit windy one of the downsides of the light this lighter is simply just how heavy it is this lighter is pretty heavy i gotta admit especially when you compare it to one of these this you can throw around and it won't break if i threw this off my porch right now i'm like i doubt it would break but the lid might come off or something like that um i would be worried about it if i dropped it kind of thing and another downside to the zippo is that it just it's expensive my zippo this cost me twelve dollars for the case and the um insert was another twenty dollars so it's basically a thirty two dollar lighter and that's a lot of money i'm gonna be completely frank now granted i like my lighters so it wasn't a big deal um but this is two dollars granted it's disposable but it's two dollars it's a great deal you can get 10 of these for 20 bucks that's that's gonna last you for me at least i don't go through lighters very fast even though i smoke pretty consistently uh i don't typically lose my lighters so it's just one of those things where i could use these i could get 10 of these and i could use 10 of them for like two years kind of thing oh excuse me but the problem with this is that it doesn't work in the wind that's my main issue with big lighters i love big lighters don't get me wrong um but it just does not work in the wind i typically use them in the summer um but when it gets to winter where i live it gets really windy during the winter so i prefer using this during the winter you know what i'm saying man this is good though what can i say sorry it's a little bit windy out here i hope the noise on the mic is not too bad man this is a good ciggy though and i've got a few more hits left but yeah that's pretty much the video what's the best lighter well that's my opinion let me know what your favorite letter is in the comments down below though i'm always curious to find out and i do plan on buying some more lighters in the future i gotta expand my collection you know what i'm saying so i'm looking forward to seeing what you all have so i can hopefully buy some of those oh man this is good and i'm gonna take one more hit yeah that's the video so if you enjoyed this video make sure to like and subscribe for more content uh i i hope this video was informative and enjoyable to you um but yeah thank you so much for watching guys and uh check out my instagram and my book in the description down below and as said thank you so much for watching um and until the next one uh peace stay safe out there", "sRECXiQaaag": "Wow lighters work with a simple flick you hold the power fire in your hands so here's how the most famous lighters in the game make that flame the classic disposable lighter most disposable lighters use butane which is housed in a plastic casing compute contains the pressurized flammable butane gas when the lever is pushed down a fork opens the valve at the end of the tube and releases a constant level of fuel the steel spark wheel rotates against the Flint the gas ignites and you get fire the most famous disposable lighter on the planet Vic creates the body of a lighter from a technical resin known as del wrap which is extremely resistant to ruptures and high heat the fuel is isobutane gas a pure gas so the pressure always remains stable this keeps the flame steady and the same height throughout the lighters entire life no wonder they've sold more than 30 billion lighters since 1973 with its iconic look and unmistakable sound nothing tops a Zippo the body is stamped out of brass and then painted or coated in the classic chrome the fuel is of light petroleum dislike aka lighter fluid soaked and ran balls a submerged wake draws the fuel up to the striker it's simple but brilliant Zippos are easy to refill and if care for will last forever Electric lighters also known as art lighters rely on electrical energy as transfer between two ceramic notes the result is a laser charge instead of a flame best of all they're rechargeable lighters are very helpful tools and knowing how they work makes them safer to use and now you know a wider arc [Music]", "3szcOk4HjAI": "hey everybody I'm Tim here with Bradley the light [ __ ] reef and this is the Tim a Bradley cigar review dude I need you stop doing that why hey sweetie what light all right lighters dude we I am reading a fire we were finally refer to Bradley as a lighter [ __ ] because that's what he is a lighter who were glue this I took this from Bradley's desk before that thing there's an important there's an important lesson in here for you gotta think Bradley's lighters like that listen if it was inky ashtray and it's billed I might have a problem I'm not a problem I'll I'll fire I like fire this is where my favorite is the colibri didn't work this is a Calibri utter failure it's what I wanted to be brothers things I like this is one of the best ones to hold like this and do your light I mean it's really good a single flame it's a nice it's an old-school calibra from like early 2000s but it's really great if you're like Bradley and you're addicted to lighters there's a 12-step group for you available somewhere hey the first step is probably a little problem I'm just gonna quit something no no sorry cigar you all right now yellow stuff out of here I mean thanks good all right there is a nice little can you stick one for MA these aren't even lighters they're just carabiners hahaha so here's the reality here's the reality we got the cigar game not too long ago right a couple years ago nobody here you go three years ago I came from a background from corporate America and automotive right yeah that was my background so when I was in the background of corporal Erika automotive I was using something called the respect sale that is when a vendor worked with you they would give you some a little extra okay to buy their product I had no idea about this before I came from sales I did a lot of sales and also come from a ministry background but Bradley understood the respect sale Bradley brought that idea into the cigar industry when he started calling out all of our reps to bring him what we've come to refer to his respect life this respect lighter dude I literally they would ask me from thousands of dollars in orders and I would ask them like it's not unfair like hey so where you gonna give me extra for that and the first person actually get this I can't remember who it was I think it was probably Nick from Oliva yeah okay leave a nick was the first guy and he gave me a lighter I don't have any more cuz I gave it to a friend okay the free lighter that's really nice Lotus lighter as a dual flame Lois lighter I was like this is pretty cool and I called it the respect lighter I shared that with many of my reps and now they bring me lighters they bring lighters are like hey Bradley I've got several respect lighters sitting in my endeavour old way of realization Airy conservative term for the number of lighters he has but there is nobody in the cigar industry better to bring you the knowledge about lighters today than Bradley and I've learned a ton just by sitting in the same office being irritated to my ears with all this lighter just talking it you just talk to me love when they come in everything stops working stops the phone stop we get the new Liars you get them all laid on his desk it just fills them up and diffuses them and gets everything just perfectly I don't have a problem so I've been trying to keep this video from happening for as long as possible but it is can't I can't it is a problem it's something I'm going to 12-steps work and the first first thing is recognizes a higher power than me which I the power yeah I understand is Jesus but now the lighters are not your guy alright I think this is not my god so we got so we're ready I'm ready for this so I'm just gonna start here and what we're going to do today is we're going to bring you ten lighters 10 top lighters from 2017 but a lighter is only as good as the cigar you use it on so tell me what we're smoking today alright so we are going to be smoking a couple of cigars we haven't done a show on them or anything like that we just got them in and loved them they're on tea and tea I got the Tranio TM 0:27 I have it's aronia volt p0 double 44 ok this is say double 40 that's four four four four okay I got a p 0 for 4 ok this is a beautiful beautiful cigar it's not do you remember this a while back Carlos Trujillo came out with a cigar called the finite ok and it was a very very unique tasting cigar it had a certain type of I don't that finally had a certain type of guard this is kind of a remake of that cigar and it is a beautiful cigar if you like unique tasting cigars by unique I mean yummy and delicious you need to grab this cigar it is wonderful mmm it's great if air where you say yummy anvil is the guillotine delicious honey it really it really is good this green label is right up the medium body alley and it's a very very very good stick as a mmm real good leather notes it's got a little bit of pepper in it but like a like cooking spices pepper right spices okay you guys anyway that is beautiful that finite piece I don't know how to pin it down but I know them they use every letter I can on the cigar yeah great all right well so here's what we're going to do on the show today we're literally gonna scratch the whole program we're just going to show you the top 10 lighters of 2017 they're ones that we think are good enough to be brought in T&T cigars we got three categories for him so Bradley's gonna walk us to right now we'll sort of go back and forth and show you some life oh here we go what do you see boom boom boom okay oh here we go fighting white we can explode they go through right yeah so let me just tell you there's three categories the lighters that I have first I have my everyday value lighters now just so you know a jet line in my personal opinion makes them the best ladders that are out there on the market especially for the value now this is called the jet line patriot okay it's a single ignition okay single mission and it's got some really good Jes on it this is super affordable beautifully constructed even as a punch at the bottom for you guys for a big punch guys alright I'm more of a straight cut guy but I use punches in a while and this is a wonderful little cigar lighter it's triple flame it's a great value we have monthien sea cigars and if you do this a hundred times it'll do it 100 times in a line if you press down the ignition a hundred times in a row it will light a hundred times where I want it I did before I absolutely well yeah your stumble wear out before the flame does your thumb will wear out before the flame does it will Wow how's it something dripping okay alright so the second lighter today for our value series of lighters is one pretty much every manufacturer has a lighter of this style alright this one is a triple flame it's got a little bit smaller of a body but it comes with that take clear tank at the bottom so you can see exactly how much fuel is in there this one's made by vertigo and let's see how it lights up I'm just it just doesn't even go out just keeps pouring out of there these are great I think that the ignition on these is pretty good the value is up there with these guys this one is actually a ripoff of the original version this one right here made by super torch by jet line again like I said before jet line I don't think you can get a better value lighter in my personal opinion they've got a version of this that I might bring to you here in a second which is my personal overall favorite lighter ever for the value for the money and everything else like that this super super torch you put your pocket is great everyday value and you can use it anywhere anytime and it withstands win pretty by the Christmas for Bradley I love it so yeah I'm excited you say I said I said even try I'm not going to get a word in edgewise now there's another one by Calibri called the quad torch by play the quad calls a quad torch by Firebird okay the quad switch by fiber is a very very good little lighter it's got four burners on it this is for like a larger cigar gauge it'll be a larger cigar sixty ring gauge guys like asylums or the where we have what's it called again are they L colosso that we have colosso if you like the asylums of the glasses this is a lighter for you it's got four burners you can go like that around there really quick and you can get it lit every single time and it holds plenty of gas in there for you okay because it is a more affordable lighter you might have to push it a few times okay and this will not be just so you know as faithful as the jet line in my opinion but it's a good value great actually especially if you want four burners on there you won't regret what you're going to spend on that the last guy you want to bring to you is what I call the paint brush this is a nice little cigar it's coming up tune for us a paint brush it's the venom 2 by vertigo and it's straight across burger it's kind of unique little thing but you've got a paint brush your cigar with it it's wonderful and it comes together a nice little hot tip so you can touch up your cigar if you need to it's a great little cigar lighter I love it and it works every single time boom boom boom boom boom it just works every single time I love it it's the paint brush right the thing that painters is our before us that's I hate that great brush I preset it like six times I started to hate the analogy but to think I like about every lighter that we've shown to you every one of the value lighters we've shown to you is that they have that clear tank at the bottom you can tell exactly how much fuel is in there and we're getting low one of the most frustrating things to me about a lighter is when you can't tell how much foo you have and you can't tell if you're running out I want to bring you now my favorite top-line lighters now there are some really really really really high top line that nobody buys if people want to impress people but I buy some functionality and I buy for fire to things functionality and fire I want to be high apps to watch you have a light and fire thanks to us so I'll bring you in a row these lighters I think you're above fifty dollars but worth the investment the first one I want to show you Tim's going to pull out right here and this is the xikar double flame okay this is our double flames a lot of knockoffs of this I think xikar knocked it out of the park though this kind of hooks an appointment this up because I didn't turn down you I've been what causes that anyway when you have your cigar lighter turn up to high you're going to get overflow of the top that extra flame not tuna now that's not there now because probably pressing out because I feel all these lighters before I got in here okay so you fill them up a little bit it's also got a punch at the bottom a lot of them have these little features they're cool add-ons a little flip out punch yeah so you can get your cigar lit anytime smoke at any time with this lighter it's a great little duel lighter and the Jets on it are very powerful and very very good so that's right and that's $67 for us all right see $7 is weighted yeah it's pretty good name just keep going yeah the next one I have for you went in some plane was done by a plane with a double fine is one of my favorites this is really one of my favorites and this is a Calibri astoria lighter okay it's a triple flame lighter you pull down the trigger is really easy to pull down you can see the triple flame right here one of the coolest things about a slider it has the best integrated double cut system I've ever seen on any lighter okay they have one called the boss we should put both fingers in to clip it but I think this is slicker cooler and more aesthetically pleasing than the double cut from the boss that Calibri has as well so you put your cap in there slice it right there put it back up you can tell people on the lighter at all and it's a very slick lighter I'm not the lighter horn that Brad's is but that thing it's like it's worth everything I have pretty big cycle so you know I like that I like red I have blue that black so I love these I give them away to friends actually gave I gave one to diagram the the head code for ASU I gave him one so these are wonderful wonderful little cigar life and it's just capable Calibri has really made leaps and bounds and their ability and the triggers and their jets and it is a great company once again struggle for a little bit now struggle for a lil bit there but it is a great company again and I think this is worth every every pin year it's been for it Colibri I believe has its on this website about 950 bucks I think it's well worth the investment for you guys that want a high-end liner the next one is one that I'm going to do only because I know Bradley desperately wants to do this one I'm going to do it nonetheless this is the St DuPont defi extreme it is the top of the top of the line the cream of the crop is good at it gets and it just comes with that price tag at two hundred and eighty dollars for a single flame lighter but it's got some of the nicest parts in the world inside this constructions absolutely flawless in the side of the lighter here the whole side of the lighter is a fuel gauge you can tell exactly how much fuel you have in there it's got some vents on the outside for breathability I don't know if the light any debris the ability but for 280 bucks because I blame these oven on it kind of needs it that comes down to the top that's where you get the oxygen for the flame no coop that cited you shows Leah put now no does it do that alright please please comment below who's right does the oxygen breathe from the top or does it breathe the oxygen - Sykes is the live in the gas it right here I don't know what all terrible it's terrible and this happens when somebody doesn't understand lighter don't like either gas and air mix out of the top of the lighter just give it back and let me review the thing this is great this is crazy I pretty much help ah-oh it like every time so Dianna it's really easy to use this thing's got a really easy to use dial on the bottom or you can turn up and down the flame as much as you want and it lights really really well I got one of these from my best friend a lady who bought it for me for Christmas last year and so not invite or [ __ ] but I have to testify this yeah the St DuPont defy extreme is worth every penny it's just a slick machine for lighting cigars it's got an excellent flame on it top-notch and absolutely works perfectly every time my last category is the super economic category and that's where some of the best values are found on TNT cigars one of the best ones we have is what we call the super lock okay this is the one to give to the friend instead too much alcohol at the party okay because they'll never open it don't be trying to open it they're like what's wrong with it you have to literally push a button just to open it up and then push another button to pull down the trigger to get light now let's just lit this believe it or not it's a wonderful wonderful little bitty lighter we got them on TNT for a super great value you got to get it especially if you like just touching up your cigars and you don't mind single flame we like to give this to people in the office and let them open it the average open time for someone we give no instructions to is about 30 seconds so it's not impossible to figure out but if you've had a few drinks your struggle it took two about five minutes all right the next one wait that is not true I resent that remark I reject it and I want to rebuke your critical spirit I'm afraid my critical spirit would come against that thing and come against everything I'm like a million down spirit you're going to say creepy idea behind me and they bow down you need to listen to Jesus name as you see right the next one is in our communities whether I'm not making fun of our guys over but you started it you disrespectful sacrilegious Irish I'm not disrespect for second with Jesus last with my jokes he gets full cringing usually pretty much because he thinks I'm a millennial Jesus doesn't like I died haha I have been one below his diaper bubbly alright okay I'm so sorry yeah that's so bad it's not true though if you got to not be likable as almost okay the next one is in our super economy category and that is Asylum 13 double flame torch we got these in we love these it's got two flames in it there is single radar pointed straight up it's got a great little Invisibles turning about medium velocity medium volume this one's turned Midway up this one is turned about halfway up right now it's not turned all the way out but there's a little dial on the bottom you're able to put fuel in this thing and it's just a great little economy later our next economy lighter has to be the best one to take camping with you it has a super interesting ignition system it is one of the best wind proof Weider's that you can get on the market even my channels are attached good on myself I did but it's also waterproof you closes waters of it's rainy live in Oregon and Seattle this is the lighter for you to be honest with you it's great to go camping with lights every time and it's got like an ignition system in here but I don't like honey jet engine it's really cool burn flatten right here see that the last one is the Republican of lighters from vertigo this one is actually called the Trump but it doesn't Trump all other lighters but for a super economy lighter it's a really good little single flame torch the biggest downside of this guy is that it doesn't have the fuel window there's no way to tell much food you got in here but what you do have fuel it lights well I lighted this thing 15 times I think I kind of alighted 14 out of 15 times there you go missed one it's gonna be huge going to be here to any age but it's not that huge but it does have the adjustable dial on the bottom it's easy to turn you don't need a screwdriver to turn this thing up or down or anything like that and it is one of the affordable lighters that we include along with samplers where you get a bonus lighter with TNT and our TNT inclusive so those are the top 10 lighters of 2017 that we want to show you today you can get all these on TNT cigars which one was your favorite one this is the one I've not shown me that I did not review this yet for this reason alone this jet line New Yorker triple torch is my overall favorite lighter I've ever had for the value and for how it liked every single time this has a Japanese two-pound trip transmission this has a Japanese two-pound trigger on it so it's very easy to work and it's got Swiss jets that made to last for a lifetime this is a phenomenal lighter at 40 bucks this is only two MSRP at 20 bucks I think we got it for less than that even okay so this and my personal thing if you're going to get a lighter you're just getting lighters this is what you want it's got a cool little square design you like transformers this is what you need to get okay it's every single time it lights I've done this no lie straight for a 150 times it lit 150 times in a row I was there excited l 150 times it will light every single time and it's got different burner system then the super torch this is the best one for overall value this is the jet line New Yorker make sure you pick it up so mine is actually this is weird for me because I am the value cigar guy I don't want to spend a lot of cigars but the St DuPont supply extreme is my favorite lighter so what I have in my backpack is red and this thing is just a great great lighter it's costly it's not cheap it is top-of-the-line and worth everybody in my opinion thank you for the gift I appreciate it it's a friend

Daisy and me at CT cigars check in with us on Facebook check also for all the links in the description below and we will see all you guys in the comments but though", "azau8pW2u5U": "what's up guys I'm the high-tech redneck back with another review for you guys right now we are going to go over some lighter technology now I believe I have found a Bic lighter killer that is right now we all know the old classic Bick this guy is rugged it is tough it has plenty of butane and it lights very reliably over and over and over until it runs out of fluid and then you throw it in a landfill and you leave it there for 10,000 years and you buy a dozen more because capitalism yay so for uh for the first you know 25 28 years of my life I stuck to big lighters as the gold standard in average everyday lighters but I uh I recently found some that are better but first let's go over some that are not better first of all we all know the average el cheapo lighter I happen to have these laying around for those of you who have no experience with these they are crap these metal tops fly off the wheels fly out the springs and the Flint's fly out of there pretty often they are not all that reliable they do function they run out of fluid much quicker than a Bic lighter will they don't have as much pressure in them as a big does and they uh yeah they're just altogether pretty crappy if I were to go on say a camping trip and it's gonna be like five below zero and I might have to rely on that to start a fire to save my life I'm not gonna carry one of these I'm gonna carry a bit but I am I decided then I wanted to try to find something better years and years ago because I'm always looking for something better so I thought I started seeing all of these disposable lighters that have refillable valves on them and they were electric so the Flint would never burn out and I thought man that's a great idea a lighter that lasts forever I wonder if that's actually any good so I bought a couple here's one that I have from back in my older excursions looking for good lighters and I still have this because it's such a piece of crap I won't carry it it functions it has fluid it does light but if you look in here you see that it sparks every time and it lights once out of every maybe five or ten we can sit here and strike on this all day long it's making the spark it has fluid there's nothing wrong with this lighter it should function but it's a piece of crap I mean the valve on it's great it refills great but it's just not reliable so frustrating hey I hate that thing I really hate using it so uh so yeah once I got past that I bought a few others and some of them had trouble with the valve where they did not take fuel properly some of them had trouble with the clicker where they did not like properly and some of them had trouble with both of those and I ended up throwing them all away except that guy which laid around in a drawer in my room for the last however many years and then and then I found this these are made by clipper these lighters are a or they are in electric lighter that is refillable they are very small and they are very very high quality they are cheaper than a Bic lighter this lighter and my local store is approximately two dollars and twenty five cents or something after tax which yes they do overcharge for their lighters there and this lighter is the dollar fifty nine which is significantly cheaper it is very much thinner than a Bic which is a good thing it fits in your pocket much better it does not look like a banana in your pocket there's one drawback to these small size and being very slim it is also shorter if you notice by a good degree and it just feels really good when you stick it in pockets and stuff but it does hold less fluid it holds a significantly lower amount of fluid but like if this bit say this big last you a month this guy may last you a week or a week and a half but it is refillable so you don't need it to hold that much I mean if you are gonna be away from your can of butane longer than a week bring two lighters or buy another can of butane it's not that expensive it's just a little more than a lighter for a can of butane that can last you a year so uh yeah these lighters are amazing and as you can see I have stocked up on them they come in these camo wraps and they also come in a solid color like the now there's a small very small difference the bottom caps are a little bit different the valve seems to be inset on the camo and not inset so much on the solid colors the subtler color one seems a bit thicker and just I mean almost identical specs but slightly different parts that they're made from probably separate factories they're made in a separate countries or something but they are just as reliable the valves on these are equally as good equally as reliable I've refilled probably 20 of these lighters including my own and lots of them that I've done for friends around the neighborhood when they've bought theirs they are very easily refillable you do have to know how to purge a lighter anytime you use an electric lighter you need to know how to purge it properly in order to refill it because after 10 20 refills it will become a pain so this is my original clipper lighter I rip the camo wrap off of it and I've got a beautiful clear lighter where I can see all my fluid see when I refill it and all that I have ruined this lighter I uh I took it apart to tinker with it just because I'm an idiot and I can't leave well enough alone this lighter was perfect for over two months I carried it used it every day it was perfect and I decided one night that I wanted to raise the flame up just to tinker with it and I took it apart and I messed with the valve and I realized that this valve does not work in the way that it works on these cheap lighters when you adjust the valve on these cheap lighters you you can adjust the flame height make it very big on this one when you adjust the valve you just mess up the way everything is finely tuned and the flame gets smaller no matter which way you twist it it's a bad idea don't do it just leave it like it is the lighters great as you can see the lighter still it's still perfectly functional there's nothing really that wrong with it but if I try to light it quickly because inside of here at the top of the valve that's a very small spring that's very tightly wound and the gas flows through that spring as if it were a tube the spring in this ladder got bent when I took it apart and it left a gap in the side of that tube and now the gas flows out of the side of the tube as well as up out of the top and it just messes up things in general and now the lighter only lights the first time or if you wait a few seconds in between it's very reliably but if you try to rush it it does not like when you rush it so yeah that's that's what you get for being stupid and tinkering with something that does not need to be tinkered with these lighters on the other hand are extremely reliable they are more reliable or as reliable as a big lighter if you like 120 times it will like 19 out of the 20 almost guaranteed it is very likely that I could do this all day and it would not fail many times these are very well tuned lighters and even after months of use this other lighter was still that consistent until I screwed it up by tinkering with it so yeah these lighters right here are absolutely amazing they are very high value the plastic on these lighters they're made out of is a very thick solid plastic they can take a drop I've dropped these and banged it around they do not fall apart easily if they do fall apart like when I take it apart on purpose you can put it back together and it's still very solid very rugged I cannot complain about this this slider right here lasted me months before I broke it on purpose essentially and these lighters here may last me a year or five years or no telling how long before I lose them because I have not seen one break yet I've heard of only one of these that ever failed and it was someone who slammed it extremely hard with like full [ __ ] strength down against the concrete and broke the plastic but of course that happens with any lighter when you throw it hard enough one small drawback to this slider it is not quiet being an electric lighter there is a significant click when you strike it but I mean if you're a hunter and you're trying to stay extremely silent and maybe a problem but in any other situation I think that's gonna be perfectly fine for you unless noise is a major major issue and you have to be extra quiet so yeah it's a it's a great profile of the lighter it carries well it's extremely reliable refilling is great I personally refilled this slider right here about 20 times and I've had zero problems from the valve in fact it's actually fun to refill it and just play with it I would refill that almost daily for a while there just because it was fun to do and I would do it while I was thinking about it and as far as I'm concerned these lighters are now officially the best disposable lighter I've ever seen because they can theoretically last for years upon years and these big lighters as good as they are have been dethroned I'm the high-tech redneck later", "UXV09sOSU-o": "hello everybody welcome back jiu-jitsu mm here today I'm coming at you with an interesting video today I want to share some of my opinions about lighters okay I've had this question come up many times what kind of lighter do I prefer what kind of lighter do I like to use so here it is the video for you explaining my opinions about lighters I hope you enjoy so stay with me okay right now I've got a pile of lighters back here that I bought at the store and I'm going to just kind of go through them briefly one at a time and I'm going to talk a little bit about each type of lighter I'm going to kind of flick them and see what I like about them and what I don't like about them now this one is the Ronson this is a pretty cool lighter I can't remember where I purchased this but these are electronic disposable lighters I do not think that they're refillable so these are Ronson let's crack this open let's take a look just briefly and for those of you who don't understand much about Ronson Ronson is basically the direct competitor to the Zippo company so let's take a look and see let's see what we have here so we have a nice-looking little lighter let's see basically push the button get a decent little flame something like that the button feels a little bit stiff and the plastic feels kind of and a weak but nonetheless looks like a decent little lighter these are kind of inexpensive they're not that not that much looks like it what it looks like it does what it's supposed to do not too bad what I want to do is I want to take this little flashlight here and I'm going to turn this on I'm just going to look through the plastic this is something that I like to do I like to be able to see how much fuel they have and flashlight makes that possible with these so that's kind of kind of a cool little lighter the next couple are made by the clipper company these ones are like super cheap bows as far as I'm concerned anyway and if you're familiar with these I think I've got them like at Walmart or something and they're they're kind of cool let's take a look I've never really used one of these so I'm not too sure let's find out I think my mom had one one time or something and I borrow that I don't know these ones this let's see kind of a cool color clipper crystal you can see down inside you know whoops sorry about that one thing I'm noticing right off the bat is the diff will where you roll it's like a funny shape they're not refillable but you know it doesn't look like a bad little lighter for the money these are real cheap lighters looks like it works pretty good yeah I'd probably do that so you got the Rob Ronson you got the first clipper let's take a look and see what this next squid clipper is this one clipper long-lasting lighter five lighters up to 3000 lights these are large let's take a look and see what we got here these are again like I mentioned earlier these are flipper that's a big lighter pretty good size I didn't check that last one to see if we can see the fuel through there you can't see the light hardly at all very dim there is the fuel level see that see the fuel in there just take a look at this one oh absolutely you can see the fuel level see the fuel in there dancing around so these are the clipper long-lasting they have the same kind of funny shaped wheel you can see the little mechanism down inside is plastic they have kind of a unique shape to them I like how the bottom is clear you can see you know the fluid inside the wheel has a funny shape the button feels kind of cheesy like it might break or something but nonetheless it looks like a decent lighter the next one is the bit click now this is something that I found interesting it says right here this product is intended for sale at Dollar General if found elsewhere please call this 1-800 three three four whatever 93 thirty-eight bic clic let's take a look and see what we got here you can see that the colors are all should be yellow and green personally when I'm looking for lighters they're usually going to go in a pack or something like that so I try to find the brightest colors that I can you know yellows and greens beans and oranges and stuff like that there you can see the fuel levels this one's a little higher on the left the one on right a little lower Vic clip it's a real soft kind of button feels good to hand feels pretty sturdy not too bad the next one or should I say to these next two you can see I got like I said the colors I tried it I bought this one specific because it had orange yellow and green and then this other one it had yellow orange and blue and these are the BIC minis you can see in my hand here the big meanie is one that I really liked to carry in my pocket it's a good lighter you can see the fuel level in there this one's get kind of low see down on the bottom this is about almost out of fuel this is a good little lighter not refillable you can pretty much see through the plastic on this have a safety mechanism so your kid has trouble doing it they have to push this little ring down and things like that to get it to go which leads us to the next bit which is the BIC classic and these are these are an actual full-size lighter let's take a look at this there's the packaging pick these up anywhere they make a little advertisement up here it says up to two times twice the lights of the other leading brands made in America which is really cool I can dig that made in America let's see if we can see our fuel level yeah you can see that one's got some fuel in it this is a bit classic everything in it you can see down inside okay remember I referenced that other one that the little piece was plastic down in here you can see that that piece is brass at least it's a brass color so I really like the way the Bix are built they put out a pretty good flame there's no flame adjustment and they're not refillable that's the blip dick classic and that's the same thing again remember I said I buy in colors I got a nor yellow yellow orange orange white brown those are colors that I like to have around my pack now another one is the script Oh script Oh is a pretty popular lighter they're pretty inexpensive I think that what there's four there are seven of them in here like under two dollars if I remember correctly I can't remember offhand but these are the script Oh slip this package over here somewhere I got like this pile of lighters over here let's take a look at this kind of looking down inside to see if that little thing is plastic or brass it looks like it's plastic to me you can definitely see the fuel level these ones you can adjust the flame on them so let's let's take a look and see go up to there down to there they also have a safety mechanism on them and the sec safety mechanism is basically these outer wheels will kind of roll they're not a bad lighter they're not refillable they're disposable throw aways I've had pretty good luck with them not a bad lighter now over here I've got you know from one of my gas stations this is a just a maverick lighter it's I don't even know who it's made by there's like some letters there snap it says right here see if I can get my life says snap right there snap I don't know who makes this it looks like it could be refillable there's a little rubber thing in there in a brass deal so you can't tell the level because it's got this sticker around it but if you remove that sticker you could probably refill it it kind of looks similar to the BIC CLIC as far as the grooves in the handle in the notch here but it's I don't think it's made by BIC it's a whole different shape it sounds pretty good flame and you do have a flame adjuster let's go a little higher and see what it looks like Wow look at that plane that's pretty high that's more on the low side I personally like a smaller flame so I'm about a little smaller than that so that's one that's kind of cool that it's refillable pick that up at maverick on own dollar or something so that's another option now here we have the the scripto company again scripto electronic I think it says let's take a look and see you can see yeah you definitely see the fuel level in there with a flashlight this one's also adjustable non refillable it's a disposable but the thing I like about this one is if you try to just push it won't go you have to actually push this way with this little thing here and it gets it out of the way and then then you can click it so this one is kind of kind of cool because if you were going to put it in your pack and it's rubbing around in there it's not going to be going off and draining all your fuel with these other ones that button gets pushed or something it's just going to sit there and bleed all your fuel off so that one's kind of cool scripto electronic kind of a cool little lighter adjustable flame go down real little small down to a birthday candle all the way up to a pretty decent little flame I like my flame something like that not too big not too small to me it's all about fuel conservation I don't want to burn all my fuel out then you have something like this and this one I bought it brand new had it for about three or four days and it stopped working it is a refillable lighter adjustable lighter but it quit on me so if you see these I don't even know who makes this or what it is spark something made in China it had a cool little flame and it lasted like I said less than a week and it was dead so that would definitely be one that I would not really recommend doesn't want to stand up then you get into these jet type this one is kind of cool just says laser jet I probably bought it at a gas station or something about a long time ago it's refillable oh I had it working earlier you can adjust the flame kinda hard to see what's going on there but it it does have a bit of flame that's electronic you know it's got a little piezo igniter in there and you can definitely see how much fuel you have there refillable and it has this little cap one thing I do like is you can lock this thing slide this little red thing over and it'll knock on for you these are kind of cool but not you know I don't know I'd probably do it in a pinch which leads you to this kind of a lighter or something like this it's got a little flip top on it and it's kind of like a utility knife it's got a little blade on it which isn't sharp at all it's almost a 90 degrees behind you know it's kind of a joke you have like a little can openers kind of corkscrew and this one was like I don't know eight or nine bucks or something puts out a decent fine though it's refillable and you can you can change the the height of the flame that's an option this one I liked a lot this one was Ronson this is basically a jet lighter kind of like a Zippo puts out a really nice little flame there it's refillable it has a adjuster where you can adjust the flame so that one was pretty cool I kind of liked that one then you get into your classic Zippos now all of these lighters that I show you right now they can use butane fuel to fill them the Zippos they take lighter fluid okay not butane so this takes lighter fluid this is kind of an older technology type type lighter I really like these these are really good they're easy to rebuild you can set them there and they'll run however like that's the ship one of the ships that I served on in the Navy I've had this one since the early 90s I mean and they they're they're good lighters Bick excuse me the Zippos you can't go wrong now I've showed you all these lighters and you're probably wondering which ones are your favorite for me personally one two and one of these Zippos those are my favorite lighters if I was to take something in a pack it would be one of those three preferably one of those two these two right here the BIC classic and the BIC mini in my opinion are the best lighters to have I don't get any kickback from BIC I'm not sponsored by them they don't send me any money or nothing like that they don't donate lighters to me not like that I honestly feel that those are the best lighters that you could buy to put in your pack well everybody I want to say thank you

I'm getting ready to do a double-sided lighter and a double-sided a freshener with the with a cotton candy make sure you don't have any lighter fluid in here because you will blow the house down make sure it's empty so I'm going to do 400 or 60 seconds and I didn't adjust the pressure for my I got the whole bit and I'm just holding me because I didn't adjust the pressure 104 60 seconds and these lighters and freshness come from MMP blanks that's from cear\u00e1 if anyone is one to purchase I'll have the link sharply posted we have about 15 seconds and then I'll flip it over and then I'm just gonna do the same thing to the back 400 for 60 seconds and then I'll put it back in the case that it came in we have about 25 seconds next time I'll just refresh this I'll have to hold it we all have any questions you can [Laughter] that's far in back and I'm getting ready to getting ready to press the air freshener so this is how I packaged it up and ship it back to the customer I just put it back in here just put it back in the box the same way it came and then I just ship it up and my bags come from on sticker meal they'll put your logo on there for you all you all I do is just put my father in the bag and seal it send it all first class okay so now I'm getting ready to do an air freshener [Music] of course amusing craft event this paper instead of 60 seconds I'm going to 40 seconds this time and pull the center I'm going to use a cotton candy cotton candy sent these come from all a Candy Girl she's been a group as well [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you don't want to do it at 400 for 40 seconds and I'm gonna just get the next one ready full when I flip it over I can just press that oil and then I'll free it package it up and put it in the bag to get shipped out [Music] okay I have about three seconds [Music] [Music] do this other side it opens up to 40 seconds as well and then I'll get ready so quick you see anybody have any questions if I miss anything [Music] with all no questions over so we have about 10 seconds and I'll take it out spray it and you'll get it ready to be shipped tomorrow [Music] this is the air freshener on the scent I got from Candy Girl I am using craft investees paper with cosmos 8 and the blanks come from MMP blanks from Terra [Music] so this is how I do my air freshener I get my scent and I spray the front three times and then I turn it over I spray the back and I'm going to let that sit for a second so that it doesn't smear when I put it in the packaging and while that's spinning I'll show y'all again the curve you like the lighter then I just did that was fine back because it's cool now so I can show you guys that's the lighter you cannot mail this with the defense whatever they lick lighter fluid in it so you have to mail the empty so always remember some elements without the fluid in it or you'll get in trouble for that so the light is off front and back blank okay so for the air freshener see if I could do it you just stick it through Oh Maria yeah come on exactly it smells good - that cotton candy flavor cotton candy Spence so you just stick it through take it and pull it and that's the air pressure on front and back I put it back in the packaging that's provided [Music] and then you feel it try to keep your scent in here and you know let your customers know that you could make it also spray a scent once the lunch the smell run out they can spray a scent as well so there you have it this is my air freshener and and my double-sided lighter both of these comes from MMP blanks craft investees paper and cosmos so y'all tested I'll try it and let me know how it works for you but it definitely works for me so thank you for being a member of craft industries if you haven't

importance in any kind of a survival situation what we may not agree on is the best way to do it uh anytime you bring that up you're gonna have a lot of conflicting opinions and i made a video a while back about a uh just comparing a couple of different lighters a zippo and an xo attack and had a lot of opinions different differing opinions in in the comment section and actually um some topics were brought up that i had not covered in the video so what i thought i would do in this video just kind of revisit that topic and maybe uh cover some of the things that i missed the first time so we're going to talk about lighters coming up next here on survival on purpose welcome back to survival on purpose your home for trustworthy information and gear reviews related to camping survival and general preparedness for regular folks my name's brian thanks for joining me and um my friends at bushcraft coffee sorry it's been a long long day and i'm tired and i've got to try to keep myself awake so i can make a video for you so anyway as i said fire's important i think it doesn't take a rocket science to figure that one out right um but there's a lot of different ways to make fire if you've seen my attempts at a bow drill fire you know that that ain't gonna be my go-to okay as we would say in georgia but i do um i always carry a lighter with me and the lighter i usually have in my pocket which i don't have is upstairs right now it's just a little a little bit lighter but a while back i made a video about let me let me just grab these i got them in the freezer because we're going to talk about that so i'm going to put them back in the freezer so we don't mess the test up in a minute but um so i compared this zippo lighter with a ranger band around to keep the evaporation to a minimum with an exotec lighter this is a titan light not this one because the one that i tested was orange and it's somewhere in a pack that i can't find i don't know what happened to it maybe it's gone so the folks at exo tech were kind enough to send me a new one and we're gonna um we're gonna restart the test i was going to do a long-term test to see how long the the fluid lasts him and all that stuff and we'll talk about that but as i said when i did that video a lot of people asked me why didn't you do this why didn't you do that some other things so we're going to try to to do a better job this time and address some of the comments that that's a lot of people brought up and one of the things i want to go ahead and address right up front is um is is price because this thing is about 50 on exo tax website and what really got me was a lot of people were going on amazon and right now on amazon this thing is and what my notes is it's listed for 126.99 on amazon people were freaking out saying i can't believe exo tax ripping people off look exotec is not selling these for 126 bucks amazon you can go on amazon you can sell anything you want for whatever price you want well probably not anything but you can you can put whatever price you want on something if somebody's uninformed enough or ignorant enough to buy it then you just made a lot of money on something that maybe wasn't worth that much money so right now um exotec has this on their website for 49.95 made in georgia in the usa you'll also see me let me just say one more thing about that you'll also see some stuff that looks exactly like exotec or really really close to it for a lot less money but i guarantee you it don't say made in the usa on bottom of it what it should say is uh this intellectual property was ripped off by somebody in china that's what it should say but a quick plug from my friends at big daddy unlimited because right now the exotec titan light which is 50 bucks on x attack site is 28.99 on big daddy unlimited so man i've told you over and over and over on big daddy unlimited is a very very good way to save money it's 10 bucks a month to be a member you get the first month for 99 cents just to check it out and see if you like it i've been a member for like a couple of years now paying 120 bucks a year basically every year i save more than 120 bucks when i go back and look at it they've again there's not a cheaper price i can find anywhere on these on the old internet than 28.99 and that's just one example constantly constantly constantly every time i try to find something every now and then like once in a blue moon there might be something a dollar too cheap or somewhere anyway big daddy unlimited and use the video if you use the link in the video description again you get your first month for 99 cents so um to me it's just a really good deal so i'll quit talking about big daddy unlimited let's talk about these lighters so i'm gonna put these back in the freezer for a minute because i don't want to skew my test up but i want to cover the very first thing the biggest thing that most everybody said about either one of these lighters and that is i just use a bic okay let me put these in the freezer and i take this out of the freezer so let's just see if it works and it's brand new okay brand new so if you're in cold weather really cold weather when you might really need a fire because you're really really cold a little bit he didn't get it now oh wait a minute there goes finally so it's finally gone but look how small that flame is that's because the butane in here does not do well in cold weather it has to turn into a gas to burn same reason butane isobutane stoves have a mixture of gas in them um and even the ones that are in really cold weather they don't work really good so anyway we're gonna let this thing warm up and see if it does better i'm pretty sure it will stick in my pocket now let me take the get the other two out of the freezer and see if we have a problem with those because they've been in the freezer too and we'll start with the uh good old zippo because i don't have anything against zippos i think they're great lighters uh you know they're classics american-made classics and there you go as you notice one one flick and the flame is very big and bright so let's close you up for a minute roll you back up so there's no excess evaporation and then we'll um check out the exo attack now again this is a oh i feel that sucker up too look it's it's mighty mighty bright too this one's brand new the zippo has been used a little bit so the wick was kind of already charred in this wick is brand new but you can see burning pretty well so let's put you out now so first test um i think both these lighters beat the zippo and that's look i like the zip i mean beat the big and don't get me i carry a mini vic with me every day because it's convenient it fits in my pocket and usually it'll work pretty good now as it starts warming up it does okay but you know if you're really cold and you don't have this thing in a warm you know by your body or whatever then you might have a problem getting the fire started so now it's getting a little better but here's the second reason why i think a lighter like this for a survival kit an emergency kit might be a better choice than a bic again i like bix because here's the deal with this big i got to hold it down right what happens when i let it go it goes out oh it goes out and that's how big the flame is what what about these here a zippo i lied and let it go if i want to i can literally just sit it there and it's going to burn and let's try a little bit of wind i can blow it out if i want to so i can blow it out but let's do a little wind not bad right zippos are known as windproof lighters so let's try the um exotec see how well it compares so let it burn a little bit so it looks to me like the zippo is maybe a little more windproof but i'm not 100 sure because again this is this wick is high and it's a brand new wick so um but it seems to blow out a little more a little quicker so we'll give that one to the zippo the windproof zippo seems to be more windproof now but both of these if you hold them you don't have to worry about keeping your finger on anything you can use these and just put them under something you can set them under a fire and let them burn get kind of wet tender or whatever going and that works really well and both of them were completely frozen so and now the bic is starting to work but again i got to hold that sucker down so there's that now what i thought we'd do is go ahead and um do a little bit of a longer test i'm going to do a long term chest with these i'm going to fill them up and i'm going to let them sit and we're going to check them you know every so often we'll do a quick check in and then see how long the fluid lasts in these i can tell you that after about three months with the first test the bic was dry and this the other exotec titan light still had still had fluid in it so but let's um what i thought we'd do now just for fun is go ahead and sit him up here i've got a ranger band on this one to try to which is just a piece of inner tube if you're not sure what a ranger band is it's just a rubber piece inner tube but i've got that there so i can hopefully kind of seal that seal it off because there's no seal here the titan light has o-ring seal both on the top up here and it has an o-ring seal on the bottom where you put the fluid in and both rubber o-rings is really really is a evaporation resistant or proof and then it also is they both have a replaceable flint and wicks so anyways what i thought we'd do is go ahead and we're just going to light both these and see how long they burn um hopefully it won't be hours because i need to get this this footage edited out and uploaded but um right now if you can see i've got um and this is my really cool by the way it's a winfield watch veteran-owned company pretty cool there um it's it's 8 39 i don't know if you can even see that but trust me it's 8 39. so we're going to light this one we'll light the zippo next to attack first just so there's no we'll sit there like that like the zippo like that and we'll just see how long they burn and then we'll fill them up again and and see if burning like that because of the wick um maybe makes it a little less wind resistant or new or more wind resistant if the if the wick is kind of charred up because this zippo wick is really charred well and this was a brand new wick on the exotec i don't know i would set the zippo up there i mean the bic up there but this is what it looks like so anyway let's uh again you know 8 39 i'll uh i'm gonna turn this thing off and come back and see how long this thing lasts and we'll get back to you okay it has been about 12 or 13 minutes and i want to point out i just noticed now the zippo has the and they're not really designed to sit there and burn like this i understand but the zippo has started burning from around the seams where the the the i guess the fumes are leaking up through there and the uh exo attack is actually the flame that's gotten a little bigger as a little more steady as the wick burns down but let me just see what happens when i give a little a little wind here and the exotec blew out always hot it's hot hot hot hot hot whoo hot hot hot hot they're both really really hot and there's no i would assume that the zippo will burn out faster anyway because it is burning a lot more fluid right now so so i don't know that this test is going to tell us is going to be have any any any real um significance whatsoever because obviously it's not the normal use of a lighter to let it burn like this so but they've both been burning for about 15 minutes now and man the zippo is cooking dude because it's uh it's leaking from all the way around where the insert slides down into the body now because there's no seal there obviously and it ain't blowing out though okay it blew out now let's see if i can find it back oh let's see what else i i use the bic to light it back oh no it lit the whole thing man it's it's so hot that the gas is just it's like an alcohol stove so not sure if this test has been any of any value at all and i don't know how long it's going to burn so what we're going to do now is going to blow them out let them cool off for a minute and we will continue this video okay well i put these things in the freezer for a minute to let them cool off and i thought that would be a worthwhile test as it turns out it really wasn't um but i do have a couple of observations that i think i might be worth sure it might be worth sharing with you first of all um when we started out the zippo flame was as you can see was about this high so and um the wick is a little shorter on this one and it's just been used this is this lighter is probably five or six seven years old and be a flame on the exotec was about this tall didn't seem as steady but i noticed as the wick got sorry for the dogs as the wick got charred up it um it seemed to get a little higher and become more steady the zippo still seems a little more windproof to me uh blowing on it but the um you also noticed it started burning all around the the perimeter where the as it was heated up i guess it was like an alcohol stove it started gasifying so um anyway that being said um i gotta say based on my experience the exotec i don't i i don't know if this flu will ever evaporate out of here zippo again um last time evaporated in about three months so what we're gonna do is we're gonna we're gonna kick that back again and i'm going to fill up the both of them full show you how they work make sure they light really good and then we're gonna um put these things somewhere where i know where they both are put them up okay it's dripping at the top i'm going to call that full and we'll close it up and then we'll do the same thing with the uh exotec and you can take the bottom off of that one you don't have to open it up and we'll just fill that up again until it's full okay again has o-ring so i keep talking about the o-rings because it's a big deal i mean that really is a big deal as far as evaporation goes what i really like about the exotec first of all i like it because it's made here in georgia made in the usa so are zippos and again i like zippos i'm not zocking knocking zippos i know there's a zippo's have a really really big following and the last video i did a lot of people really came out strong in support and defense of their zippos but just just to be straight with you um there's no o-ring there just like that okay so it's working now we'll close it i'm gonna fold this this ranger band up that's about the best solution i've come up with to try to seal this thing off and i think i learned that from dave canterbury let's light this one up here it's going to have a lot of fluid around it okay so it's working we're going to put it out and now there you go and it is um september the 3rd 2020. so i'm going to put these uh somewhere that i'm going to be able to find them this time and we'll come back and check on them again maybe once a month and until we'll see first of all how long the zippo lasts because i know the exo attack is going to outlast it and then we'll just keep checking the exo attack and see how long it lasts as much as i like a zippo i think for the um this is maybe say it's ten bucks eight or ten bucks for this zippo we'll call it maybe it's five bucks uh this is 28.99 on big daddy unlimited so say it six times as much so you could buy six of these for what you can buy one of these for if my life depends on it and i'm going to have a lighter in the survival kit that uh may or may not get around to messing with um i'm going to put this one in there just because of the o-rings because i know i know i know they'll outlast the zippo this is good for about three months and i'm just the kind of person i'm not going to go back and check all my bags every three months to make sure the zip up's got lighter it's got a lighter fluid in it i'll put a bic in there too but as you saw bix have some significant limitations compared to a liquid fuel lighter the two biggest ones again just are cold weather doesn't work very well and the other one is you got to keep your finger on that thing and hold it down if you've ever tried to light a fire with a bic this not it doesn't like really easy you know if you don't have any any pre-made tinder or whatever you try to hold that thing in there you know sometimes it'll burn your hand really good and it's not very windproof so as much as i like bicks i think these are my go-to for a survival lighter the x-attack titan light so anyway i'm rambling i'm going to shut up now um thanks to the folks at exotec for sending me a replacement for the one that apparently i lost so i could do this test and as always thank you for watching survival on purpose if you want to support the channel financially i invite you go to patreon.com survival on purpose and become a

"hello so this is going to be another video about lighters and in this one I'm going to look at different categories of lighters and who they might be most suitable for because the problem is you seem to get a lot of time on YouTube people who saved X type of lighter is the best lighter and what they're actually saying is that for my particular needs in a lighter this type of lighter or this particular brand or lighter is the best one however because I've got quite a lot of lighters in my lighter collection it becomes obvious that there's not really a one-size-fits-all lighter there's not one lighter that's really good for lighting cigarettes utility use you know survival uses and all things like that that can do absolutely everything and there's definitely light is better than others that you know can multi-role a few things and a very good at one particular thing but I'm still yet to find a light that I think that's the most perfect lighter over that's my EDC lighter I never want to have a lighter than that one it just doesn't really happen so let's go through the lighter types that most people would use or men become a bit more specialized and we'll talk about the pros and cons and also this is not all of my lighters but this good should give you you know a good idea so let's start off with the classic Zippo this is a brass it's not the regular type one but as you know from my videos I prefer this Zippo to the regular Zippo just because the tolerances are a bit tighter so this is if I wind proof well so you've got your windshield on there what are these very good for well if you are somebody who frequently smokes liquid fuel lighters are brilliant because because remembering you know constantly be topping it up every couple of days it's never really gonna run dry Zippos built like tanks or parts of them last ages I did a video recently on the pros and cons of Zippos if you are a frequent smoker then makes the cons of a Zippo don't really exist one thing I'm not going to be recommending in this video is disposable lighters personally because I don't like them very much I think it's quite a false economy you know especially because the quality of some those disposable lighters other than Bix it's quite poor anyway so often you're buying a lighter that's not going to reliably work doesn't have much fuel in and then you know you have to throw it away when you're done with it but there aren't Bix and receiver as I said no disposable lighters the quality control is actually fairly good on Becks again I'm not a fan of them because I like lighters that you can refill so Zippo very good if you're a smoker good for some utility uses because it has got the wind proofing on it doesn't want to light again though whatever reason I think that's just because there's probably not enough liquid fuel soaked into it because as I said before Zippos they tend to run out fuel quite efficiently you know which isn't a great thing but again if I was a smoker I'd be briefly as every few days but I've quit smoking so yeah but a good thing of Zippos they are built very strongly there they have this iconic sort classic look to them I would definitely not think it would fail as long as you're constantly topping out so Zippos are very good in that regard if you're a frequent smoker or you want a lighter for minor utility use I think as if those are great they certainly do that very well now I quit fuel lighters I personally prefer my EMCO the reason I like this is simply holds fuel much longer than the Zippo does my brass Zippo holds fuel probably about twice as long as my regular zipper windproof does this holds it about twice again so this can sometimes last a month to two months on a single filling which is pretty good I've been over the m co before I just like to design one Zippo I like the lights on opening I think that's just a really good design and you can take this bit out and use it like a candle I'll see it you went to light and then pull it out but overall I really like the design of M codes it's just a shame in our business but personally if I was using a reason for a light to light those opposed like I was a frequent smoker I would personally prefer the M co2 to Zippo but you know that's personal preference lots of people at a Zippo both for excellent lighters if you can get hold of an M cope either a this is a 6600 junior I believe yep so if you can get hold of a six thousand six hundred or six thousand seven hundred or six thousand eight hundred genuine m co ones they are very good the other two are bigger than this one they're all very similar in design this is like most primitive of the M codes but it is the only one I found refurbished in good condition at the time so what the other types of lightest people use it well one of your most common lighters is your disposable sort of or refillable butane lighter butane being a gas it looks like a liquid when it's in the lighter if you can see it up there because I'm will see it's compressed inside it I like the clear Clippers of mice because you can actually see through I mean I prefer the metal ones in terms of general build quality and everything but the Clippers are absolutely excellent lighter so you refill it at the bottom you can refill it with cheap butane it doesn't have to be good butane because the tolerance is aren't high enough the it's going to cause problems the striker and gas release which right next to each other so it's really easy to just you know flick them and like them if you want to and yeah you've got this which is like your little pipe tool you can use this to pack a pipe you can also use this to OC release sparks as its own separate thing and these are replaceable as well if you really wanted to do that so you can see there well that stays ins the lighter so as I probably said loads of homes on this channel I love Clippers just simply because they have such a well-designed lighter they're completely you know built from a utility perspective you can pack a pipe using the bottom of this they are actually shaped like that for a reason you can PAP pack a pipe or use this as a pipe cleaner all right cigarettes or joints whatever with that and that works really well just you know all around these are good lighters another cool feature on this is when it the flames out like that if you turn it down increases the flame output like the gas output goes up when the light is that angle which makes them even better for lighting stuff so really good design I really like Clippers they're cheap as well I in my opinion if you're going for a regular butane like to always go for a clipper but there are a couple of other options of butane so I'll show you that now out the cheap light as I've ever seen these are probably the best I mean ignoring like you know just mass-produced Clippers these are called tour jet lighters basically these are refillable butane lighters and you can actually check the liquid level in them by turning them that sing low basically these are jet lighters you probably can't see the flame all that way on that but that's a really bright hot jet lighter flame now these are a really you know good designed reason is I like jet lighters but the tall jets are really cheap jet lighters so I think you can buy a pack of five of these normally just over a pound like it's two or three pounds or something for a pack of five which is really good when it comes to the price of lighters it's an adjustable flame as well the switch is there which might be a bit hard to see on camera so if I said it's the opposite direction you'll see it doesn't really light because it's fully off which might be good if you're having it in your bag and you don't want it to go then as you adjust it you can see that changes the size of the flame so they're really good in that regards the only issue of tour jets is after quite a few refills and uses they are going to break but again they're cheap and if you're buying a cheap for multi packs that doesn't matter too much and because it's a jet like too technically you should be using refined butane with it or extra filtered butane not the stuff you'd feel a clipper with if you feel jet lighters up with the stuff you'd refill Clippers with it eventually gun jizz up the inside because it's not as pure it's like cheap petrol compared you know no better refined petrol/gasoline if you're putting it in your car you know I use red X something like that again because tour jets are cheap and you could probably get quite a few good few refills out of it before it gun jizz up it might just be worth doing that anyway in my opinion the problem is if you get better jet lights as that's when it's a problem now one of my favorite designs of jet lighters ever these this one's the cony one but I've seen these called profit apparently as Eagle I think it's just the Chinese company that makes these and then they're rebranded so you've got your gas selector switch there it's angled so the flame doesn't go near your fingers which I like I means you can also use it any angle and why I like how obviously you can see how liquid level I always like clear lighters for that reason so there you go izya electric ignition or piezoelectric ignition you can see the jet flame there very hot what I really like with these is actually DIY you so we're going back more into non-smoking utility use you can use these for smoking good for light and cigars as well because it's a very hot torch flame but what I really like with these is I've done minor DIY work where I've needed to heat the metal to you know get it to bend or something like that very easy of a light too like this convenient and small so again also very wind proof that went out then it's not working as a watch you know Carol never boils but in fairy jet lights is a very wind proof just not when I'm trying to demonstrate them okay so we've got one more type of lighter to show you which can be practical very impractical depending on the design okay so electric arc lighters or plasma lighters this one's the for hue one or for you one it's got an on-off switch on the bottom these just simply recharge using a mobile phone recharger now these are really good lighters though this particular brand is anyway because as I said before with this brand the electrodes are really easy to get you know where the arcs are so you can actually light things practically with them it's got a magnetic opening thing that keeps it open closed which is good this is not a stupid design shape that sits in the pocket easily my major gripe with lots of electric arc lighters where they could like cigarettes fine and then they can really do much house because the opening fall and was really stupid lots of them had these lids that would cut off if they you know were too far closed you had to have the lid on there if you rip the lid off the lighter wouldn't work it was a safety mechanism and you know and the electrodes are really hard to get out this one they've got around that by having an office which on the bottom a much better idea and then the ignition switch is this so what's really good about these lighters is if you are lighting stuff with them although they do make a bit of a zone which you can actually smell when they're burning they don't obviously have fuel now with things like liquid fuel lighters they leave a taste on whatever you're smoking so we're nice tobacco it's not really a you know good thing butane especially if you're using refined butane from a high-powered jet lighter you're not going to taste too much but these are the best in terms of not spoiling the taste of tobacco or something like that in that regard now if you get an electric hunt like to have a design like this they're brilliant because you can recharge them easily and they can light pretty much anything and they do burn things very very quickly the problem is lots have stupid designs in terms of they've got an accessible electrode or if you want to call it an arc but the lighters built like a really long stick which is impractical if you want to keep it in your pocket or they've got the designs where they're a nice compact lighter but you can't barely get at me um you know arcs or light anything and the problem is lots of them advertise themselves like you can use it as a utility lighter oh you can light candles with it you can light incense of it you can like us light a cigarette with it you know you could start a bonfire in your garden with it but you can't because of the stupid design this one's the only one I've seen where it's got a practical design now some people don't like the high-pitched noise they make I'm gonna say they always sound worth on the YouTube videos and they do in person I think it's like compression of my ways of going compression of silent kind of thing but in reality these are pretty good if you get the design like this I really can't complain about this but anyway hopefully this video has Illustrated that there's lots of different types of lighter designs around that have pros and cons compared to others so I'm a better design than others like you can get the jet lighters that are the survival ones of really hard cases and you know like the floating ones that waterproof yeah really good I've got one of those but all in all what you want from a lighter is going to affect how well it works for you which should be obvious but some people it's really not they say as if those are the best lighters ever Zippos can do everything you know Zippo zipper zipper or clip is the best like a clipper can do everything over one nothing I could become do i one thing clip Condit blows out really easily right so there you go nuts this video hopefully it lets you get an informed decision about what certain lighters can and can't do you", "cvX2WFlIG_k": "how's it going everybody my name is Dave purple and you're watching Busch radical today's video we're gonna talk about fire when you're in the backcountry you have to be able to have a fire if you got to be able to start a fire if you need one you're gonna probably want a fire at night just to sit around and enjoy fires gonna dry your clothes out fires gonna keep you warm fire might save your life so when it comes to making a fire there's only two things that I'm going to endorse there's only two things that I would recommend that you have on you the good old fashioned cigarette lighter and the feral rod the old standby the new standby what's the benefit of each one and why would you want to take one over the other the lighter gives you a flame feral Rod gives you a spark that you could potentially get a flame out of this is gonna work for I know maybe three four five six seven eight maybe a thousand flights you might get a thousand flames out of this that are gonna last you five or six seconds you know just enough to get a fire going now with a Ferro rod you're gonna get a spark that can ignite fine tinder and get your fire this gives you an actual flame this gives you the potential for a flame you get the lighter what you're gonna have to dry it off get the Ferro rod wet and it's not gonna matter at all the real difference between these two things is how fine you've got to get your tinder material you can grab a handful of dry leaves and grass and light it on fire with a lighter and with a Ferro rod you're gonna have to make sure all of that material is processed down tour it can actually get lit by a spark that's a finer process the lighter is going to eventually run out of fluid so it's not a really long-term solution the feral rod if you took your time and processed your material so that you were sure one strike from this feral rod would light your fire and you never just played with this thing to make sparks and you never lost a good Ferro rod like this could probably last you the rest of your life so then I'll lighters not gonna last you the rest of your life a lighter can get broke it can get damaged it can run out of fluid if you drop it and the little wheel pops off the spring and the little tiny barrel rod tiny piece of flint that's in there that produces the spark it's gonna go out and you're probably never gonna locate it and get it back together a Ferro rod this size costs about 10 or 12 bucks lighter like this cost about 99 cents at any gas station this is a lot cheaper this is gonna last you a long time but it's not going to last you the rest of your life even if you really do take great care of it but there is something to be said about flame you don't have to build a flame by the combination of Sparks and perfectly prepared tinder you just start right out with a flame one of the real downsides to a cigarette lighter is how fragile it is you know you can drop it and knock the top off it or you could crack it and all the fluid can come out but it's also important to remember that feral rods are fragile or can be fragile too it's not that difficult to break one of these in half by dropping it on rocks are really hard around yeah it's made out of metal but that doesn't mean it's that tough and then you have a rod that's much much more difficult to strike another downside is that a Ferro rod is not gonna do much of anything by itself it needs some kind of a striker whether it's sharp rock or the back of a knife or the back of an axe it needs another tool of some kind to make it work for all the downsides and the $0.99 price tag on a lighter it is self-contained it doesn't need another tool striking it to make it work it's got everything it needs a lot of people love to pooh-pooh the old cigarette lighter because you know it gets wet and needs to be dried out it can get broke it's not going to last you your lifetime bill lasts a long time but it's so cheap it's so common it's so omnipresent this is very easy to overlook as an option but in closing I would say these two tools are two different tools that have different pros and they have different cons they have different pluses and minuses they do different things very well they're both very affordable and the point I really want to make is there's no reason to pick one over the other or say I wouldn't use this I would use this you might as well take both buy five of each of them put them in every pocket in every compartment of every piece of gear that you've got you might as well have one taped to the middle of your canoe you might as well have one pinned up in your hat there is no limit of how many of these things you should have with you so that the next time you're out in the bush in the wild out on state land on a big camping trip canoe trip and you need a fire or you just want to fire all your options we'll be right there waiting for you in your pockets and you can just pick whichever option suits you the best my name is Dave Whipple if you like this video hit the like button the thumbs up and subscribe in the little Bell to give you guys updates of one I post videos which I try to do quite often thank you guys so much for watching be radically see you soon", "QMJqUMR59G0": "hello everyone this is going to be a video and what's the best type of lighter fare everyday carry so what you'd have on you every day and I've got a selection of different types of lighters here because it's also going to vary a bit depending on what you want to use a lighter for so I'm going to different categories of lighters at the top left here we have oil lighters or petrol lighters liquid fuel lighters lighters at work when you fill up the inside of them with a flammable material and then soaks into the lighter and ignite so those if unless there's a typical example of a.m. we will lighter liquid fuel lighter in the middle we have the Zippo and the Bick so not as if I'm a vicar clipper and a Vic and they are simple butane gas lighters whether these are the simple strike wheel type nor piezoelectric and you have a gas release button igniter releases a gas strike wheel with the Flint ignites the fuel on the right we have jet lighters sometimes called torch lighters they have a few names I think super fuel light is another name they're given and they work by having a higher pressure prior pressure get butane gas compared to the Zippos and the Bix which all see creates a jet plane rather than am sort of wider softer flame at the bottom we've got an electric lighter now if you just wanted an everyday carry lighter for cigarettes an electric one is probably the best you charge up via USB at the bottom mini USB microUSB that sort of thing and you press the buttons and it creates an electric seems like so now that is easily hot enough for lighting cigarettes and one of the big problems needs is you can't really use them the utility lighter some companies advertise in fact you can but you can't really get anything bigger than a cigarette in there and safety feature on these which is a bit annoying if you want it for something out of them cigarettes is when the lids closed its on light and that's good though because you can't self in your pocket you hold quite a lot of charge you wouldn't need to charge them that frequently so if you're just using lighter cigarette should probably be your best everyday carry lighter now what I'm going to suggest is with liquid for your lighters this one at the top here is a peanut lighter and when you open it you can see that there's an o-ring here and that oring prevents the fuel from escaping so although it has no wind resistance this is a great backup option because you can fuel it every couple of months if you need to keep it on a key ring or somewhere and you can have this as a backup to any of the other lighters right so we've looked at these ones already so let's just leave those remaining so for a complete or liquid fuel lighter I have two good options we have the Zippo on the left and we have an ink on the right this is a brass version of Izzo very famous lighter flick it open it's right at the wheel ignite it now the great thing about a Zippo this wind resistant they called wind proof they're not she wind proof but they are wind resistant this sort of shroud here gives it wind proofing as you can see the air would need to blow from the top to put it out Zippo is great the only issue is because of the looser tolerance and Zippo lighters compared to so many other liquid fuel lighters they tend to dry out faster so although you could consider a Zippo unless you're using it everyday for lighting cigarettes and things I wouldn't personally go over their pose simply because they're going to dry out when you need it now we have the in code jr. 6600 which you'll see on the bottom there if the camera focuses on it light it's probably a bad angle for it to focus in code jr. 6600 and this is a similar lighter to the departed liquid fuel it strikes on opening it's also wind resistant again you need to sort of blow it from the top to put it out but it's a bit more practical to me a Zippo in a lot of ways one because once you've lit it yeah you can pull the bottom section out and use it like a candle so it blows out easy when it's like that because it doesn't have the wind shield around it there but the great thing about these is you can take that bit out separately as better fuel retention as if I'd because of this bit here which keeps the fuel from escaping through the wick as easily as a Zippo and you can store spare Flint in the inside bit there so it's like a Zippo but better in my in your knees in colitis you can't buy these new as for such that you can get secondhand service ones online for about 20 pounds right now we've got the standard butane lighters and we have here a bit and the clipper I personally prefer the clipper the lots of people swear by Bix both work in exactly the same way strike it light but I'm being the press releases the gas striking it here lights it now Vicks aren't refillable but that means that they have very very good fuel retention so what a lot of people like to do is buy a sort of package of these disposable Vicks and then they'll put each of the lighters in a different coat pocket or something and then you've got one whenever you need it so it makes a very good disposable lighters much better than the cheap disposable lighters I'm not a massive fan of dicks in the sense that they're not refillable but if you want a good disposable lighters dicks are the way to go now what I like more about the Clippers and the Bix is a couple of things because they are refillable you can refill them at the bottom there they can pack pipes as in smoking pipes by you doing that with a bottom there you can pull out the Flint that's going to be difficult to do in the camera so you find in there we go and you can use that in a survival scenario to strike without a lighter attached to it but you can also use this for pushing in the ends of the Rolly cigarette so it's got all those features going through the Clipper another thing I like about the Clipper is that when you light it if you turn it down this way the flame gets bigger that's the features designed on these Clippers it releases more flame when it's turned on its side again I really like Clippers they're probably on my favorite lighter designs just because they're very cheap for how good quality layer so now when we've also last set the jet lighters now jet lighters are really practical because one of the problems of these type of lighters as good as they are very little wind resistance while it's doing quite well here but yet it goes out compared to um say the electric lighters which are also wind resistant just to show you cuz I didn't show you that earlier you can use those when it's windy these you can use when it's windy because of the shrouds they have on them these you come now with jet lighters how they work again similar to a standard butane but it's a torch flame now these are great in the wind because have sort of just said they won't go out however people do complain in cold temperatures these don't work using it now there's a problem with all three of these lighters and what that is is that the buttons are exposed so you can leak fuel when it's in your pocket if it was in a position like that you've come to use a lighter not it wouldn't like because you run the fuel down from it being in a pocket where something's been pressing against it not a problem of these lighters because of the lids on them not a problem of this lighter because obviously you it doesn't work when the lids closed so if you want a jet lighter or a butane lighter that works like that this is an ultimate survival technology floating lighter it's great because it basically seals in its own little case impact resistant case to an extent that it floats if you drop it in water so it's waterproof unlike all the other lighters and also stops you pressing the button in to get it to work when it's in your pocket so yeah we've got the incredibly hot jet flame that you can angle very precisely and it works in the wind so out of all of them I think this would be a really good air every day carry lighter as long as you're not going to be somewhere where it's incredibly cold you take lighters are fine this one you can't accidentally discharge in your pocket you've got extra protection for it with all the case and it's waterproof if you just want once a cigarette I've said these electric lighters are great and obviously if you did want to go down into route there of these lighters as well which I do like and I've said the peanut lighter is a great backup keyring lighter simply because of the o-ring there stop most of the fuel evaporating unlike those two so it last much much longer than the Zippo liam coat", "g0wOK89tfwc": "what's up everybody my name is Ray Taylor and I'm about to do a Zippo lighter unboxing with the prep that you want to do when you get a new Zippo lighter as well as some some tips and tricks nothing no real tricks I guess so she's your basic packaging from getting lighter Walmart actually is your basic shrink wrap package with the small little instruction booklet and the lighter itself coming in a nice little felt tray so there's the lifetime guarantee and then your basic showing you the basics on how to prepare your lighter because it is packaged and shipped a little bit different than optimal for maintaining the wick and fuel burning potential so it's got a satin black finish with a brass showing through in the logo on the bottom right there it's got a nice weight to it and of course the warning sticker on the back of the lighter and as always peel that sticker off there hopefully not leaving any residue as there is no residue shown you can use the lighter fluid to clean off the residue if there's any left over so lighter feels good so see the little wick there showing through on the Flint working but there's no fuel yet before we add the fuel going to need to do a little preparation here's the bottom of the Zippo case month of K year 2017 and then the open bottom of the lighter first time I got a Zippo lighter I didn't know that there was no bottom to the lighter I didn't know that was a normal thing just your fill lift to fill so to repack this first you need to remove the screw a lot of people recommend you could say you can use the lid to remove this screw but I don't like to do that because it could end up damaging the lid itself of the case you don't want to do that but there's a lot of other things you can use with this tool the multi tool not only screwdriver but you're gonna need the pliers and of course scissors when you want to trim the wick so you're gonna remove the screw and that's where the Flint is housed so there's gonna be a spring attached to the bottom of that screw so you want to be kind of careful that it doesn't shoot out although I don't think it's it's all attached so it shouldn't shoot out too bad you just unscrew this little screw at the bottom and it's got your spring on the end of the spring attached to it that holds the Flint right there's the Flint and I'm gonna show you a little trick to store extra Flint's so now that you remove the screw you can use your multi-tool or some people will use the actual tip of the Zippo lighter fluid in that hole that's on the bottom of that that a pad there's gonna be rayon balls in there so you're gonna want to try and remove those I try not to fluff them up I want to keep them packed in makes it easier to repack the lighter after you've kind of reoriented the wick so use the multi-tool pliers to remove the little rayon balls and those of course will get soaked with the fuel and that's what holds the fuel inside of the tank keeping the wick nice and moist so you see they're pretty simple inside you got your wick that's got the braided copper going through it now we can remove this wick right here pretty easily and if you're gonna replace the wick would be kind of the same procedure it's that wire woven through it keeps it pretty rigid but you want to try and keep the end from fraying too much it's not a big deal you can always adjust it later but you just stuff it through the hole on the top and then grab it through the chimney with your pliers I like to bring it out a little bit so you give it a little twist at the end and then you kind of pull it back down for height now recommend it is to keep the wick at the top of the chimney or just below the top of the chimney if you want a smaller flame you can pull the wick down and that will give you a little bit smaller flame which I prefer it doesn't use up as much of the fuel so you're not having to refill the lighter as often but it still gives you a nice flame I've never had a problem lighting any of my smoking material with the lighter with a little slightly shorter wick so what you're wanting to do here is you want to zigzag the wick which is also shown on the booklet here the illustration so that's gonna kind of you're gonna want to weave that wick between the rayon balls so that the soaked rayon balls can keep the wick nice and moist and doing its job so repacking these it's it's not too bad as long as you don't fluff it up too much use the multi-tool to push it down in there and you you want it kind of tight because it's you'll see at the end it's like repacking a suitcase it's for some reason it never works quite as good as the first time so you're gonna want to pack a ball in move the wick over and then pack another ball in on top just zigzagging the wick emulating the illustration now I've seen videos where there's more rayon balls but I think potentially there were a couple stuck to each other so you know stuff in the last of the rayon balls and you need to pack it in there nice and try and keep any excess rayon or cotton it's synthetic cotton get that in there get those little fibers use the screwdriver part of your multi-tool which i would i would say is a must-have with a Zippo lighter you can do without it you can do a lot of this stuff with just the case itself or your fingers but you know in an attempt to not damage the case it's always nice to have a multi-tool so you gonna slide the bottom portion of the lighter back on it fits nice and tight there and then you're gonna want to dump that Flint back into the Flint tube and then followed by the spring which a new spring a little bit tricky to get the screw to catch you want to screw that screw back in into place and then when you go to tighten it you don't have to tighten it too much just make sure it's not loose I'd give it a little tweak with the screwdriver just to make sure it's in there nice and good even though it's not it's you know when it's sitting on the bottom of the case the worst case scenario when you pull the lighter out of the case the spring will just dump out and you might lose your flint but after you fill up the the lighter with lighter fluid there's a nice little little place for you to store extra flint that's coming up very soon so you lift the little tab there on the bottom and opening up the Zippo lighter fluid you can also use the lighter lid for that which probably won't damage it too much because it is plastic the top of that Zippo fluid so you're gonna want to fill this kind of slow let it sink in you want to try not to overfill the lighter not a huge deal unless you really over felix you don't want it leaking inside of your you know your pants pocket or whatever so this is another way to fill the lighter if you if you open the little spring-loaded arm there you can put the lighter in upside down in the case that way if it does drip a little bit out of the wick because as the wick gets soaked it will drip a little bit of the the fluid so you can set it upside down it makes it nice if you need to set the lighter down for any reason a little convenient make it a little easier to fill so you want to fill a little bit wait a little bit if you start seeing it pool up you've probably put too much in less is more but it's not a huge deal if you overfill it I've done it I've seen plenty of videos where it's done you want to make sure you try and get any of the excess fluid gone because you don't want to light your hand on fire anything like that but eventually it'll get sucked up or just it'll just evaporate you know you overfilled it when you go to tighten that little felt pad down and then it's you can see it's soaked through yeah I don't think too much of it leaked but if it did it would be trapped down there and once you put the lighter back in it'll just soak it out so it's a nice little trick putting the lighter in upside down inside the case and if you want to store extra Flint say you're out and your Flint goes out and you want to replace it you can use the case to undo the screw if you don't have your multi-tool available or a key or a you know coin those little Flint's will fall and get lost very easy so what you could do is you can put your Flint in the bottom where the fuel goes on the the felt there I've heard of generic Flint's or non the non Zippo brand disintegrating from the fuel but the Zippo brand Flint's tend to hold and not dissolve so it's a nice little trick to keep you know one or two extra Flint's with you just in case and then you put the lighter back in snap the little spring arm back out so it can grab the lid and the the wick here still a little frayed out and pointing over to the left which will give you a little bit bigger flame if you had the the wick closer to the wheel gives you a little bit smaller flame and again if you you know cut the wick a little bit shorter than just underneath the chimney height I'm gonna get a shorter flame as well I'm just trying to kind of get some of those stray hairs in place and there you go nice flame great lighter super easy to light that first strike on the Flint is always a little a little stiff close it up nice and clean that's how you prep your Zippo lighter to keep that wick and the fuel not so you're not going through a bunch of fuel at once probably not a good idea to have the Zippo fuel open while I was lighting the lighter but mistakes can be made nothing happened this was not a blooper video but I do enjoy that multi-tool it helps out a lot and that's all she wrote with this video I hope you enjoyed the video on how to prep your Zippo lighter and I hope you enjoy your lighter for many years to come because that's why you get a Zippo lighter you take care of it it takes care of you alright everybody peace out", "ls8pMLBgr8s": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay you will need a empty lighter and be sure that is 100% empty next with pliers remove the metal piece and don't throw away we're going to use it later now cut one-third of the lighter and you will get micro starter with two storage chambers from this metal piece I have made small fishing hook and micro needle from matchbox I have cut small piece of phosphorus paper and made micro matches [Music] in storage chambers we are going to put the micro matches small hook micro needle for compost nylon thread with phosphorus paper and cotton from cotton buds for starting easily fire [Music] we're going to make this waterproof by sealing the bottom with hot glue making a hole for placing a key ring and this micro fire starter kit you can wear it on keys [Music] you make some magnesium dust and strike over cotton very easy and survivor way to start a fire make one for yourself you don't know when you're gonna need it any quadrille gum if we want to make it out from this lighter we're gonna need superglue some solid copper wire and wooden handle and holder for copper wire [Music] I'm using fresh colors like blue and green so can always find this hoe drill tool when I need it at mode now take the wire and put inside wooden folder they take make before and you wanna make several loops on something to get this twisted shape that helps faster to absorb heat from fire and on end of wire you're gonna make sharp tip like this take that super glue and glue the boat wooden pieces handle at bottom and hold the wire on top of lighting let's talk [Music] Oh [Music] the mini hoe drill gun is finished and many of you wonder about that pushpin on bottom of lighter that makeup tubers is how I refill my lighter and you can check the video here now let's test the for drill gun its heat up very fast and it's very handy mini tool I hope you liked it share with your friends and don't forget to

see you next time", "Vl83NU-_-wM": "morning guys I'm Dave Canterbury with self-reliance Outfitters in the Pathfinder school and what I wanted to do today was kind of jump off the cabin series for a minute and talk to you about a product line that we're carrying currently at self-reliance Outfitters of XO tack products I think that EXO tack is a solid brand we have just recently started Kenya products in the store but I have been carrying three of their items for quite some time now one of them I've been carrying for a while over a year and the others I've been carrying for one of them for several months and then the other one for just about a month so I've tested them on and off but the last one that I got I've been testing it now for about a month as I said but I use it almost every single day so what I wanted to do was talk to you about these three products kind of go through them and also talk to you a little bit specifically about the EXO attack lighter because there seems to be some confusion or some problems that are coming along with people using this lighter that are used to using the Zippo type lighters and it is a different animal altogether so we'll talk about that in just a minute stay with me okay so the first product I want to talk to you about is this EXO tack lighter cover now all of these items that I have are in black we chose to carry orange on our website to begin with because I believe it's a good high contrasting color that you don't lose easily in the woods and for someone buying this to put in their kit I think that's a good idea the black ones were sent to me as samples so I've been using the black but the products are exactly the same just a different color so the exit a Collider cover basically takes any pick lighter and makes it waterproof by giving it a rubberized cover that goes over the top of it and friction fits so there's water proof and I have tested this in a bucket of water and it is waterproof now the other thing with this lighter that it allows you to do with this lighter cover is it has a split in the back of the cover here that actually can slide over the top of your button my fingers a little bit cold today that actually will slide over the top of your lighter button to hold the fuel button so that when you light the lighter it's about 10 degrees out here today so my lighters naughty wanted to light but when you light the lighter one disadvantage to the bic lighter you got to keep it warm when you do this it will hold the fuel button down so that if you don't want to hold your finger on the button for a long period of time for flame you have that advantage with that flip up keeper I just put paracord on mine to keep the lid attached to the lighter so I don't lose it and I made it tight so I pull it over it's a friction fit but I don't have anything dangling off of it in my pocket to get in the way so that exit attack lighter cover is the one I've been carrying the longest and it doesn't really take that much more room than the bic lighter does itself but it helps to waterproof that bit lighter and I like that really really well ok the next product I want to talk to you about is called the match cap and this is the match cap XL I'm not sure if we're carrying the XL or the regular match cap on our website the only difference is capacity but basically it gives you a waterproof match container just like a metal match container but it has an o-ring seal and a striker that's built inside of it to be protected when it's sealed from the moisture and it's made to fit the waterproof matches the storm matches that are made by you co so if you're already using you co brand products like these matches you can use this exit AK match cap to keep those matches in and your striker will then be on the inside protected instead of on the outside of the case like the plastic you co case has now the u co case has extra strikers on the inside that are tucked into the case but you can also I believe this one comes with a few extra strikers as well in the package that you can put inside here if you'd like to but I haven't had any problems with this one and I've used it quite a few times the advantage to these u co matches these storm proof matches is you just can't put them out you can put them in water I've done videos of it pull them out they light back up put them in water pull them out they light back up Barry pull them out they light back up so if you're looking to carry matches as an option for fire and there are some advantages to matches for sure especially for younger folks who can't necessarily manipulate a lighter with cold hands or if it's cold outside in your lighter doesn't light matches do have some advantages if you need fire right to second and so I do recommend this product it is waterproof I have tested it there's no question that it works and it's not a very expensive product for what you get a lot of the metal match cases that you find today that are made overseas have some inherent problems with them these products are made in the USA extra tax a great company and I like them and I trust your products ok now let's talk about their latest product that Titan Lite and this is a for lack of a better description a regular liquid fuel lighter very similar to a Zippo that has some advantages over the Zippo lighter first off it has an o-ring seal and that is an advantage in that it will not let the fuel evaporate but if you overfill this lighter it can be a disadvantage so let's talk about filling this lighter now I've had this lighter for quite a quite a while about a month and when I first got it I overfilled it when you overfill it you're going to have problems so what I would recommend is you take that batting and just saturated enough really quick a couple three milliliters is enough if you take this cap and you filled this cap up twice and dumped it in there that would be enough to get you started for sure what will happen if you overfill this lighter is because you have a closed chamber with no release the pressure will build up in here and push the excess fuel up to the top and you're gonna have leakage problems and when you light the lighter you're gonna end up with flame around the outside and probably on your hands if you're not careful as long as you don't overfill it you have that problem so you've got to be cognizant of that when you buy this lighter it is a very very good product in my opinion I've been using this one for a month every single day and it works very very well you can see it's very very wind resistant the wind is blowing right now and it's not blowing it out we don't have a 20 mile an hour wind but there is some wind okay and no lighters completely windproof that I've ever seen not a lighter like this anyway even a Zippo but this will take some wind then it won't get blown out as long as you've got fuel in it you can blow it out by blowing directly on top of it but when coming from the side doesn't blow it out very easily now again if you overfill this lighter you're going to have fluid leaked into this upper chamber of this chimney area and then it's going to spill out these vents when you open it up and you're gonna catch the outside the lighter on fire and probably your fingers at the same time so don't overfill the lighter to change the flint you just push in the detents on the side and you'll be able to take the top chamber off and get to the spring in the Flint very similar to any other type lighter like this if fluid the fluid is filled from the bottom just like I showed you to begin with and again you can use this cap as a measuring device two of these caps initially is enough in that batting to saturate it and make that lighter work and you won't have problems with the fluid coming to the outside and all over your hands you can see I just put more fluid in that lighter and it's not coming to the outside even if I shake the thing up and down I'm not going to get any fluid on the outside that lighter this lighter is very simple to use you just have to understand what not to do what you don't want to do is overfill this lighter other than that what I can tell you is that's the first fluid I put in this lighter since the first day I filled it a month ago and I use it every day so it's very good at conserving fuel I did have problems with this lighter leaking into the top because I failed to follow the directions on their website and filled it straight to the top of the batting like I would with a normal ship oh the problem the Zippo is not going to give you that problem because the fuel can evaporate if you overfill this lighter by accident I would suggest taking the top off and leaving it sit for a while to let some of that fluid evaporate out then you should be able to alleviate the problem or just use it and live with it and telling us not leaking anymore and then don't overfill it the second time around but you can see I just filled it back up with some fluid and it's not leaking it off in my opinion this is a solid product I wouldn't back it if I didn't think it was okay guys I just wanted to take a few minutes today to go over these 3x attack products with you number one because their new product on our website but number two and mainly because I have seen some people have problems with this ax attack Titan light from overfilling the lighter I appreciate your views today I appreciate your support I thank you for everything you do for school for our family for business for all of our sponsors instructors affiliates and friends I'll be back to another video as soon as I can thanks guys", "45MmW6Kxnqg": "okay we're gonna do a training video on how to do a bit

disturbin no hard [Music]", "dtl3pw8LwTI": "okay so uh I hear a lot of internet banter I won't call it factory myths but a myth gets spread online and then it just runs rampant nobody nobody proves it right or wrong they're just there's like well it's true because this person said it it's like that game of telephone right and no one ever is like well I want to see it that's a myth or if that's actually true so in that regard I got two big lighters in here if you haven't watched my previous videos one of these lighters is the one I ran for 50 some minutes and it still worked but I just got tired of holding the ignition button and then I have a mini bic lighter which is completely full and then I actually have a Zippo which is the same one I used in that last video but then I refilled it I put them all in a container and then I put the container outside until the water froze so all these are in frozen water right now and so I'm going to change camera angles when I use a heat gun thought this out a little bit crack the ice off all that stuff and then we'll see if they light up okay so first as you can see ice pretty cold so I'm not going to sit here and watch ice melt for an hour so I just have this heat gun whoo that's cold enough said let's move on okay so you got no way the thing is when I did my water dunk test the same thing happened so we're gonna let this just dry out for a little bit and you can see that there's even ice crystals in the wheel the Stryker wheel so people are like they can't freeze once they freeze okay listen water is not drinkable in freezing weather it's called ice and that's what I just melted okay so I pulled the lighters out of the ice all three of them zip on two lighters when lighters freeze the fuel inside the lighter loses pressure sometimes there's ice build up around the Flint wheel though the wheel so it doesn't turn properly or there's ice and water and moisture there's a really simple trick your body is 98.6 degrees right so like when you're going into hypothermia it means your core body temperature is like dropping by like fractions of a degree and when you're going into hyper thermia it means you're like heatstroke so like that it means your body body core temperature is getting a little too high so unless you're dead okay your core is going to be warm even if you feel cold your course want to be warm your skin on the outside your core might not be as warm but you have a couple things you got your hands so you just hold the lighter in your hands for a couple minutes you got your armpits here you got blood vessels and whatnot running through there so you just you go like that is this is really warm right now even on the outside of your jacket so you just put your put your law your lighter in here I'm not saying walking around like that that's stupid I'm just standing around whatever now you have a groin you have different areas your body two areas that are convenient to do this you can store lighters or whatever is say winter winter condition you're getting cold you need fire first if it's winter conditioner what do I have if it's summer you should have be wearing some type of hat baseball believe whatever cowboy hat so you got a lighter in here this is the one I just pulled out with ice the mini Vic okay working just fine right and it's only been my half for like three minutes oh another area and it's not as easy easy you kinda have to buy something else or make something else is one of the warmest areas is next your heart I mean seems self explanatory but a lot of people don't grasp this concept later right here depending on like you know you can take this out or you can use it in the sheath you let it go you're not going to drop it I didn't make this sheet totally cylindrical I made one side a little bit tighter than the other one so it hopefully you can see that it's made out of kayaks here has some eyelets I just strung some paracord okay it slipped but I was pulling you know spreading my neck how I designed it it has a curve on each side and the reason why is don't push on the red part but push on here okay and this is either on your neck or you're holding it and see that curve it just is a little more comfortable and it's kind of a design feature comes up just fine winter conditions whatever when you're done push it push it push it the you push it in the harder it gets put back on your neck this chief actually you almost never have to take off especially if you're wearing neck night and you just got this or another feature you can attach this to a neck knife so you got your knife which you don't really have to keep warm and you also have your lighter which it's better to keep warm in cold cold weather and you drop it back in it lands right on my what's that your cloud clears sternum bone or whatever right between my ribs so but I put my hand here it's super super hot it's like when you feel someone and they have a fever same thing so all these myths out there okay that's what they are I'm kind of doing a series right now just waiting through a lot of the BS out there so somebody reads something and then they spread it then they spread it or maybe some people maybe some people have been out there they have their lighter they drop it they step on it and whatever end somehow it freezes solid or some say it's like in a pack okay and you go to sleep and you're dumb enough not to put it in your sleeping bag pocket that they give you or leave it in your pockets and in the morning it's totally frozen okay and you go and it doesn't work and you want your morning fire okay totally valid point it's not working so you're like okay because of cold weather that's why this isn't working but the flip side of that is you're being stupid you're not using your head your head is your most important survival tool so instead of aha okay the Claridge are stupid what you could have done is hey let's think about this how can I heat this up how can I make this warm and the same philosophy a lot of people don't know this but the same philosophy applies to water bottles so one thing it's in the other room right now but usgi us force flasks 16-ounce flasks your made out of the same material that canteens are but they're thin and yeah they only hold 16 ounces but all you got to do is wrap paracord clove hitch right around the the neck of the bottle do lanyard and in like winter travel you throw it in there skims your body and as you progress you take it out you're drinking it and as you move along you take it off cram it full of snow put the cap back on put it back in under your shirt though the same philosophy philosophy applies there flashlights the same thing sometimes they don't work as well when they get super cold like I've heard all these like all this internet bands are out there so hope you like this video I'm not trying to like talk down anyone or say you guys are stupid or whatever I'm just pointing out that everyone probably the same people that say pick later suck are the same people that are like your head is your most important survival tool but big lighters when they get cold they don't work well well don't let them get cold use your mind or if they do get cold warm them up use your mind that's my rant for today but again if you like this video you like this content make sure to give it a big thumbs up if you haven't already subscribed my channel and I will catch you in the next video", "Mw8ySp1c5Aw": "Hynek Perdomo Perdomo cigars there are many ways to light a cigar and in this video I'm going to tell you the pros and cons of each one that I use regularly [Music] [Applause] [Music] naturally one way to light a cigar is matches and they come in long and short and I recommend you get the longest ones possible because they do burn very fast because they're wood and we don't want to burn our fingers they have pluses and minuses the pluses are they have sulfur ends and won't affect a flavor of your cigar which I like very much it also works very good of your inside if you go outside the minuses the wind so if you're going to use matches a lot of people have the preference for matches make sure you're inside where there's little wind to know when and because of that it's not my favorite because a lot of times we're outside and so on but matches is one of them another way is the old cedar stick and basically these are just strips of Spanish cedar and a lot of cigars even have cedar wrapped around them one of ours does are ready soon the sylvio and in the actual individual coffins come wrapped and cedar and that's just to imbued a slight amount of aroma and into the actual cigars but I find it redundant because you're going to have to light the cedar stick to light the cigar again and I find that to be like I said a little little redundant but it is fancy and another thing is that the cedar burns so fast that you got to watch you don't burn your hand and a lot of people think that also when you light up with a cedar stick you're going to imbue cedar into the cigar I'll be quite honest with you I've never tastes it but if you like it that's cool and of course you have a soft flame lighter and there's pros and cons Oh soft flame lighter the pros are they're very easy to buy you can actually purchase them in any supermarket gas station like most of us know and you can have everything from a bic all the way to something real fancy like this and what's important is on any saw flame lighter that it has butane because butane burns clean and it doesn't affect the flavor of the actual cigar where there are some lighters that actually have petroleum-based fuels that are put in and when you smoke the cigar you'll actually taste the finest of that fuel when you smoke it so make sure your lighter has butane and yes the standard bic lighter uses real butane just like this fancy soft flame lighter the cons of the lighter of course are windy days whether it be outside or even inside with under to a ceiling fan or so on because a soft flame is gonna blow out what's important is if you like it and a lot of people like soft flame lighters okay when I'm sitting in a lounge I like a soft flame lighter but I also and I've talked about this previously on several of our videos on the important of toasting the foot of the cigar when you have a soft flame lighter it's kind of hard to toast the foot of the cigar but you have to be a little patient with it but there's nothing wrong with it so those are the pros and cons that I think of a soft flame lighter and finally you have the torch lighter this is my personal favorite it's the most commonly used lighter today we actually did a survey we had 143 smokers and we asked them what their favourite way was to light a cigar 83% picked a torch lighter and it's great you can use it in any environment you can use it at the golf course you can be outside it can be a windy day they come in single flame they come and double torch they come in triple torch a lot of them have punch cuts this new one that we have from Perdomo actually is chargeable so it has no piezo and it just has a soft touch and you get you get a great you get a great torch at the same time what I like about the accuracy of it also you know I can like the cigar just get on the heat source just above the flame and light my cigar perfectly they even come in colored flames now at night let's say you're outside you're hunting in the evening or you're in a really dark spot you can get colors of green and red and blue and what I love about them is they take butane and they're reusable and you can use them consistently so I really like them for those reasons and I really like them because of the ackers if there's one downside if I had to think about on the torch lighter it's these three letters TSA those are the only guys that give us a hassle when it comes because be careful when you go to the airport they'll take these away from you they won't talk they won't take the soft flame away from it but they take these and because these lighters are more expensive make sure you check them underneath the airplane now that you know which is the best lighter to use check out this video and you can see what the best cutter is or another video on how to properly light your cigar [Music]", "Ns_2BsQlHnQ": "hey what's going on guys so uh today i wanted to talk about a uh lighter this is an old little lighter and um i actually recently posted on instagram me using this later for a um a pipe i enjoyed a pipe my bulldog meerschaum um church warden it's been a long time since i enjoyed a pipe and uh in that post i call people say messages about the lighter asking about a little bit it's an old dunhill lift arm lighter from 1925 and this thing is cool dunhill of london has been around since 1893 and they basically specialize in classy goods that's pretty much the best way i could say it they literally have thousands of products you know um you name it i mean they make everything that's classy it's pretty much all high-end stuff uh and they've been doing it for over a hundred and what is it it's 20 20. let's do the math real quick i didn't figure this out uh seven years to 1900 so it's 127 years how about that a little mental math um in 1921 they came out their first store in new york city and three years later in 1924 they came out with their first store in paris and one year later they came out with this lighter from 1925 and there's all kinds of patterns on the bottom here which i'll show you in a second in 1927 is when they officially released this i guess worldwide as the first one-handed opening lighter style okay this uh obviously pre-date zippo zippo came out in 1932 so in 27 they're like hey world we have a lighter you can use with one hand because previously it was two-handed lighters um and then obviously a couple years later uh five years later exactly zippo george g blaisdell in bradford pennsylvania said uh no i got this cool lighter design too and that's one uh one hand operable so let's go ahead and zoom in on this so coming in nice and close here you can see this is the unique lighter from dunhill so that was the name of this unique all right there is a little uh knurling on the side here so i could probably open this yep you can tighten it you know with a flathead if you want but this is your little fill area to put in your lighter fluid all right and then this cap also houses a spare flint tube all right so you can unscrew this as well this is where you can keep your spare flint which is really nice because you can have the lighter it can be filled up nice but if you run out of flint and the spark means you have no flame and the lighter is no longer useful so it's always great to have a spare flint um this slider has again because this is before it was officially released this is when they first had their patents so on top here you have a canadian patent all right so they patented this in canada it's made in switzerland all right in the middle here we have an english patent okay for like the uk and then there's an american u.s patent so they have three different patents that they put out to ensure that no one would be copying this and they're very successful apparently this lighter and many many many variants of this lighter were very very popular over the years all right taking a look at the side here they flip around you can see it says dunhill on the arm and again this is called a a lift arm and it's very simple concepts we have an arm that pivots and this basically covers uh the flint area with the spark wheel as well as the actual um little wick that's there okay so doesn't dry up very easily so you would just push on here and it would lift up this entire arm and stay out of the way there's the flint wheel which rotates okay and throw sparks at that little wick which has fluid and then snap shut on the back here on this arm there's a spring in here there's a little uh flathead screw so if you unscrew this that's how you would access your flint so flint on the end and then a pusher then a spring okay so it's keeping tension on that flint so when you turn that it does spark just really really cool very uh simple version of this they made these in sterling silver they made these in gold they made them ornate some of these had a clock inset in the face which is really really cool and these can sell for thousands and thousands of dollars the plain ones like this are worth about 150 to 200 dollars really just depends on who's looking and when uh could be worth a little bit more just again just depends on the interest in it but they generally sell very consistently on ebay for like 150 to 200 250 something like that uh the sterling silver ones they sell for like 500 to a thousand dollars depending on condition obviously the gold sells for even more so i ended up trading my uh kaiser champshire for this uh this lighter i did a video on it and um you know someone really enjoyed it they did offer this later and i was trying to figure out because i really wanted this for the collection i wanted to actually use it it's just a really really nice quality lighter and it has a ton of history i mean being made in 1925 this thing is what 95 years old already um it's awesome it's just really cool but my intentions are to just enjoy it for a little bit and then pass it on uh just eventually sell it or trade it or something just makes for a cool piece anyway just wanted to share this with you guys as far as lighters are concerned i generally focus on zippos and only zippos um i do have a variety of different layers and stuff but they don't like specifically pique my interest they're usually just add-ons and trades and stuff and i do enjoy them i do use them but i don't focus on them too much unless they have some kind of historical significance which this one did i've kind of always wanted a dunhill lighter this does work fantastic for pipes they do make specific pipeliners as well um you know but they're expensive very expensive this one happened to to pop up in a trade offer and i had the right thing the person wanted and uh worked out the trade so i just want to make this uh video to share with you guys again you know posting on instagram a lot of people were were interested in uh and what layer it was they just knew it was old but yeah the dunhill unique lighter very very cool from 1925. so that's it for now hopefully you guys enjoy the video thank you so much for watching and i'll see you tomorrow with another video you guessed it so take it easy guys", "WaUQFJrXLl8": "how to properly light your pipe with one of these what's up everybody Eric here from tea and tobacco today I'm going to go over how to light your pipe with a butane lighter correctly so you don't get any off flavors so let's go so you think that lighting a pipe with a lighter is very straightforward but there are a few things to consider one is that the flame of your butane lighter is much hotter than matches and because of that you can get some very burnt and charred notes out of your tobacco when using a lighter over matches so basically unless I really can't because I'm like driving or something like that I will use matches as much as possible otherwise than I am using a butane lighter so really the best way to go about using a lighter whether it be something like this is as I car resource or a plain old bic lighter is you don't want to be drawing the actual flame into the tobacco so you don't you want to keep the flame as high above the tobacco as possible so you can use the heat off the flame but not use the actual flame to set your tobacco a light and get those burnt flavors because those burnt flavors are coming because you are heating up your tobacco to hot the flame off of the butane lighter can be fifty to a hundred percent hotter than a match so really it's pretty simple this lighter a you want to keep it so the flame is still kind of curving up when you are when you are drawing on your pipe so you just need to get it close enough that the heat off the flame can let the tobacco ignite because really the difference between what you actually need you only need about six hundred degrees to light your tobacco versus the roughly 1,200 degrees that the flame is so you can hold it pretty high above also this will help save the bowl of your the rim of your bowl as well I'm using a cob zone about it but you know so as you just saw there the the flame never got sucked down into the bowl and it was a good quarter inch off the top of the tobacco that's in my pipe right now and you can still get it alight and that way you aren't gonna get those very burnt and charred flavors out of your tobacco so there you go that's the proper way to use a butane lighter to light your pipe thanks for watching everybody be sure to LIKE and subscribe comments feedback questions down below I've also opened up a discord channel if you're interested that will be down in the description and I will see you next time on tea and tobacco see you guys [Music]", "Muoa1haYwU8": "hey guys thanks for watching push bottle 5 I'm Chris and this is Brandon we're back it's been a while we've missed you guys um today we're here to talk about big lighters and everything big that we have in yes we do have big and Krish bottles Rupert's I don't I got those take it away Brandon tell us a little bit about your favorite ones oh well I'll tell you what I like BIC personally I prefer them over those crack towards plastic ones that break all the time they're horrible these you can actually put in your pocket wash them and let them dry out a little bit and they still work so definitely awesome how do I still do that - I I still till this age oh absolutely finding them in my walk exactly and there's 3,000 lights if you can get to it before your friends feel it or you lose it it happens to everyone it's okay and has a travel lock mechanism on top so there's all different styles brandon loves the california one which they have it all different metropolis cities so you could find one that suits you but Osterberg eyes so it makes sense you got palm trees you got beaches you got high sky mountains surfboards to serve or search board my personal urban gypsy favorite is the sacred geometry lighters so we have rainbows we have line work we have all kinds of Sri Yantra style yoga favorites over here - that's the way anything maybe

give this a shout and keep it cushy and use a bit lighter", "AdSVCPA-fio": "real men smoke pipes and shave wet of course but that's a different topic hi this is john from switzerland and today's video is about my recommendations my top 3 pipeliners for pipe smoking beginners now you have decided to start pipe smoking that's a very good decision but now of course you have thousands of questions which pipe is the right one to start with which tobacco is the right one and yeah which pipeliner do i need or how many do i need and so i thought maybe this little video can help you with this and we start right away place number three the big lighter not really a pipe lighter but yeah this just means for me big lighter is cheap and easy to get lighter and usually single usage only but some of them are even refillable so of course you have to learn how to hold it when you want to lit your pipe with it so that you won't burn your thumb but that's no problem at all okay it's not fancy looking but on ebay or on etsy you can find some handmade leather pouches here where you can put your big in and then you have a very nice and cheap lighter for your pipe or you can also choose one of these simple cheap ones which are easier to use with the pipe because of this little nose here you can even adjust here in the ankle a little bit so i think this is a good lighter to start with because probably your first pipe is not a real expensive one maybe it is a corn cob maybe it is a basket pipe so i think you don't need a fancy pipeliner because you want to smoke a pipe you started smoking a pipe but who knows if this is really for you and who knows if you won't decide in a few days weeks or a month that this is not for you this is just not your thing and you quit again and then it would be very annoying if you would have had spent much money on a fancy pipeliner place number two and the only the one and only one when it comes to smoking a pipe outside the zipple zippo with the normal insert here for cigarettes yes that that works as well for a pipe but it is a bit yeah it's it's not very easy to handle because the flame comes out here and for the pipe you need it here in the middle but like i said there are lots of different inserts this is the pipe insert for the zippo and so you can use this perfectly well for your pipe and of course if you don't like using fuel inserts you can also use butane inserts also with a hole in the middle here for pipes but then of course it's the same with any other lighter outside it's no storm lighter than when it comes to storm and wind you need definitely the fuel zippo best thing about zippo lifetime guarantee and yeah they will survive anything anybody anyone so zippo here place number two and also not very expensive i think the pipe zippers start around 30 bucks maybe so place number one let's say the old boy because old boy is the the name of pipeliners which look like this this is not an old boy this is a zycar pipeliner but it was built similar to the old boy and the old boy by the way is also only the copy of the really original one which was a dunhill unique launched first time in 1927 and seven years later the company i am corona launched their old boy which looked exactly like the dunhill and this is how they look still today and many different companies meanwhile have these old boy replicas petersen retrace i think as well um jean-claude and so on so they are not really expensive i think about 50 or 60 bucks and what i like why i decided to take the xy car version is because this is the um also with lifetime guarantee and yeah so you can't go wrong with a zeiker even not for especially not for this price i think i thought it was empty but no it's not so very nice lighter and this is with a click wheel and of course there are also versions more heavy more yeah a little bigger here and with piezo yes the thing with piezo is they used to die very soon though so within the first two or three years and so i again choose chose the zeiker with lifetime guarantees so in case there will be something wrong someday with the piezo i'll just send it to zeiker and get a new one that's a more expensive one around 70 bucks i think but i really love this lighter yes of course and also many other pipeliners are available out there and even very very very expensive ones from up to i think 60 000 bucks yes that was the latest prize for a special dupont pipeliner so um yeah but that's a different topic different video will come up um then the topic will be my personal pipeliner collection but this was my recommendation the top 3 pipeliners for pipe smoking beginners thanks for watching subscribing commenting of course until next time bye says john from switzerland", "XHZJ2LtiBM0": "hello everyone today we're going to review this uh this awesome big lighter sleeve or case of protector what they will call it this one is like i had heard it kind of scene or style skeleton's hand holding a rose three rows in the other side there's a little hole in here okay this one fits at a full size lighter full size big lighter you are pushing a little bit sometime you had to peel the label okay okay hopefully you push it inside like this you are easy easier to peel the paper when you're pushing out just use the samsung pushing here and then pop the light out okay let me remove the light it's a little bit of time you have to remove the paper here about 3 inch 2.75 let's present the skill oops 53 grand look one more time very good very good so solid and a little bit happy too next time you don't have to worry about losing your lighter you can find this from our website smokingcats.com thank you for watching", "vT_QwDg96Bw": "um basically my friend who I gave this Zippo MPL to which is my favorite version by the way with the adjustable head on here and the all-black it's pretty sweet lighter but anyway she get back to me Jeff oh no no it's wrong it it looks like there's fuel in it because I explain her there's a little fuel window in there and it's filled and it just doesn't work it was just clicking it wasn't working so I want to troubleshoot the lighter and I did it and I fixed it and everything but I wanted to kind of you know redo what I did so I can show you here on film because it's probably a very common problem with butane lighters and this is a butane lighter and basically what happened with hers is air got trapped in the line okay very simple problem very very simple fix now first of all shame on me because I'm not using Zippo fluid in fact besides showing you how to fix your butanes I'm also going to do a rant on this Firebird fuel because it's horrible it is dirty fuel I'm just doing this for demo purposes I do not have any Zippo blue you know butane right now I have to go to the smoke shop tomorrow and get some for her because I will you know empty this out and fill it up with some good fluid so she hasn't any problems but um yeah this stuff stinks first of all this is like a Walmart fine probably five years ago and it was dirt cheap I think it was like 80 cents a bottle of something on sale so I bought a bunch of them I still have it left over put it's horrible crap first of all you came to get the cap off the minotaur hard you pull and try you can say knocking you all over the place I have to get a little flathead and like basically pry it off it's absolutely ridiculous alright the one good thing that it does come with is a little adjustment piece here which narrows down the neck so you have the option of using just the straight nozzle like this or for some lighters you do need a smaller like adapter piece so it does come with that but besides that it smells horrible it's dirty it runs dirty it does clog of your lighters which is a whole separate issue and you can't get the cap off so I don't like it but for the demo purposes I'll use it here I do like that it's a clear bottle so you can clearly see it's left its another pro but don't get it it's just it's jump don't ever get it so anyway I'm not gonna use this tip for this so first of all we'll see that the lighter is actually I'm learning exercise playing with it it does in fact work you can see I have the the flame is on but there's not a lot of fluid in here right now plus there's another issue I'm going to talk about a second but it does have fluid in and is currently working although not very impressive looking it is functional what happened with her is like I said is that there is air trapped in the line now this sometimes happens when you refill it I did make a video on filming a butane lighter before but there are a couple key points that I missed in making that video and basically it's kind of like troubleshooting it's explaining how to fix most problems with butane lighters because if you have Zippo lighters you've seen you know there's tons of ways to fix very simple problems however with butane lighters if it doesn't work you don't know what's wrong usually one of two things either you have a fuel issue or you have no spark because you need both to create fire but in this case we have a spark and then sparks flying it's just a fuel issue so there was air trapping line so what do you do alright if your lighter is sparking really see a spark in the top which is going to be just a little blue spark then you know that's not the issue if that is the issue then you need to fix your ignition ignition which could be a real pain in the butt and usually not cost-effective most of the time it's easier to get in the lighter to be honest but if you have a fuel issue like this it's very very simple fix so you want to do first is empty lighter completely okay completely purge it as well as called and we're going to remove all of the fuel how do you do that well on the bottom here we have our flame adjustment knob but on this particular Zippo the thing just pulls right off so you'll see the little valve in there the refill valve and only want to do is push push that with something small and pointing when you push on that valve it will open it up okay because we don't have a gas now connected to it it's just going to leak you will hear it and see it leak out very fast or emptying the fuel on the lighter okay hold the valve open until it stops making that fart noise downside of the deadly but yeah I want to completely remove all the gas from inside the lighter and the wines neck in here when I push back on this again there's still fuel in there hopefully can hear that so just hold it down be patient get all the fuel out alright once it's completely empty we're going to refill it and the purpose of doing this is again to make sure that the lines are completely filled with the butane lighter fluid and not oxygen or air all right so just takes a couple seconds now if this is really filled up it'll be a very big rush of gas and it is compressed so it's very cold something else I'll talk about later in this video so just be careful because we got to push like that it could just shoot all over your hand it's not a turkey about being compressed like that it is extremely cold and it will be uncomfortable plus is a fire hazard obviously do not do this open you know or around a open flame anywhere I think that's common sense but I should say anyway since I hear common sense in the so common so yeah don't do this over an open flame anywhere alright so almost SP here all right you want to literally do this until there's no noise whatsoever but they can make a video 50 minutes long you know so anyway um you just manometers could put doesn't matter either way for this now assuming that the lighter is completely out of fuel okay which this looks to be again you can always check to make sure you have your spark you can clearly see that nice substantial blue spark every time I ignite it so that's not the issue now we're empty we want to refill it this is where you can refer to the other video which is very simple make sure you're nice and straight up and down very quickly make sure you're totally square pull it there for a couple seconds all right now here's a very important part that I did not say in my original lighter video but it is important we are dealing with the compressed gas okay it is extremely cold when you fill a butane lighter you will feel it the bottom of this is now very very cold you need to let your lighter sit okay you need to let it sit for a good 5 to 10 minutes so that this gas becomes room temperature this is important because you want it to flow properly I can tell you almost everyone watching this video probably has never done that if you own butane lighters that you refill you filled it and then right away you go hmm did I feel it right and you try it now most of the time it will work but the Ganis really should take some time to warm up a little bit alright so that can flow properly now just like most people I'm going to try it right away you see it does work that's fine and everything but you really you really should wait a while to have it to work properly now because it's cold even though this is on the high setting it's not going to come out how I really wanted to which is the higher more powerful flame and now let's say my get the spark tip get my spark but the fluid is still too cold so again this is where you have more issues so there we go see it really needs time to warm up a little bit so that's my second tip to you is first of all purge your lawn completely to get it all air and other gases out of there make sure your your filled up nice and then give you your lighter some time to warm up a little bit alright that's important for it to work properly so now this is basically fixed and the flame on the high setting will get bigger as the fluid warms up a little better but anyway you can see once I like this fight adjust the base here I can't control the height of the flame to really low and then this should be higher on high but anyway the lighter is functional but I'm going to purge this of this really crappy Firebird Chinese Walmart guest crapola is horrible and I'll get some good Zippo brand butane I can't tell you with regular lighter fluid okay for your Zippo lighters you can use Ronson brand totally fine works great you can use cheapo stuff like that when it comes to butane do not skimp out alright pay the extra two dollars whatever it is get some Zippo brand fluid you won't be sorry it's campus ridiculous it really does make a difference because cheap butane has all kinds of little particles of crap in there and it's imperfect gas and it's a lot easier to clog than regular lighter fluid alright so you don't want any problems with that so again to recap real quick if you're having issues you're definitely getting a spark but you're not getting a flame completely drain your lighter and refill it to the brim and let it cool down for a little while and see I'm getting the coils lighten but I'm not getting my flame now probably still too cold or it could be that and as I turned it all the way down Oh cheap piece of crap gas I'm doing a demonstration and I am not making it look very good it's like I don't know I'm talking about anyway alright there's very few things that can go wrong with butane lighters but the biggest problem is when you don't have a spark that means your electric starter is not working and that is an issue and it's not like you can just go get a replacement you'd have to kind of rig something up or steal it I have a different lighter or for the most part when those goes when those go if you don't have like a lighter collection per se to use like spare parts I just threw out your lighter and you know call it a day if it is a Zippo brand butane lighter of course you have that guarantee that's why we all pay a couple extra bucks for Zippo brand lighters because they are guaranteed for life no questions asked by far the best guarantee on the market for any product if it's something wrong with it send it back we'll fix it or replace it for free every single day of the week so awesome anyway that's it guys just want to make that kind of an update on the butane issues because I get questions quite often about butane lighters people say well you got Zippo videos you know can you help me on my butane lighter it's really cool God if my dad whatever the story is but it just doesn't work I don't know why that's probably going to fix your problem guys drain it refill it and let it cool or let it warm up I should say so anyway that's all um and again when you're doing this with the fuel please don't do it by a flame anywhere like I said it should be common sense but I feel like I have to say in anyway just in case so that's all guys hope you enjoyed the video hope it helped you and I thank you for watching hope you enjoy the rest of your day take it easy", "ObmQoNN0Am4": "What's up guys! I brought you out to the mountains today to show you a cool trick you can do with a lighter. Now over the years I show you a lot of different ways you can start fires without using matches. But some people in the comments say why not just pack a lighter? It's small. It's compact. And with the flick of the thumb you got instant flame. And that is true as long as your lighter works. Lighters are extremely handy tools for starting the fire, but they do run out of gas and sometimes the get smashed. You might find something like this on a hiking trail when you're hiking your camping spot. If you do, it's not garbage. The reason is because this striker wheel and flint will still make a spark. Now a spark by itself isn't enough to start a fire. We need a lot more than that. But, it's enough to get us started. Now the first thing to do is to find some kind of a flat board. Relatively flat like this. Because we're going to take the side of that striking wheel... and run it slowly down the board like this. The longer the board, the longer your stroke is going to be. What this is doing is grinding off some of the ferrocerium inside... and making powder you can use to ignite the flame. Now, you don't want to go too fast... because if you go too fast it'll make a spark and the whole thing will go up. If you do just slow enough though you can scrape that ferrocerium rod into a powder... without it actually igniting yet. You want to do this about 40 to 50 times on a stick about 8-10 inches long. Now by holding your letter sideways as you roll it as the dust forms, it falls down and catches inside of the cap here. So all we have t do now is turn it up right into whatever material or tender we want to ignite. And then all it takes is a flick of the thumb... we got ourselves a fire. So look at that guys just like that we have ignition of our tinder pile. While our little pile is smoldering here I'm going to make a little tinder bundle... and we can blow this into a flame. Now, in an ideal world you put your tinder pile inside of your tinder bundle before you lit it. But since it's already going to be something like a business card just gently scoop underneath it... And transferred over the file. Once that successfully transferred to the card... Put your tender file over it and just gently roll it over. And you can see how nicely those embers are formed. That's going to build up into a fire very very quickly. And now this point all we have to do is add a little bit of oxygen... and we've got ourselves a fire. There it is. How cool is that? But, if you have something like a paper towel or Kleenex this is going to work even easier. Just make a pile of your dust right in the center of the paper, and when you give that a little flick the entire paper will catch on fire. You can use that as your tender instead. Just like that we have an instant fire, and we need to get our fire pit really quickly. A very simple trick and it does not get much easier than that. Thanks so much for joining me for this experiment. And I'll be looking for you in the next video. Talk to you then.

hopefully I will see you in the next one", "_bC0eVM3mYc": "today we're gonna be what I think is the arguably most known lighter and most used lighter in North America the BIC maxi classic lighter that's right this is a serious review happy April Fool's Day the BIC maxi classic lighter let's start with the price right out of the way this lighter will set you back a whole one dollar as far as the unboxing experience is concerned it comes in no packaging you just grab it off the shelf of your local gas station or convenience store and there you go so as far as specs are concerned it is a flint action soft flame lighter it is two and a half centimeters long by 1.5 centimeters wide and eight centimeters tall for our friends in the States that's one inch by 0.6 by 3.15 inches it also weighs 20 grams filled up as far as a construction of the BIC maxi classic the entire body is made of plastic with everything you need placed conveniently on the top on the front you have air vents on the sides you have a Bic logo on one and a warning sticker on the other and the top contains the burner the flint and an actuation button so how do you use this later it's quite simple you just want to grab it like I am from behind where you have your thumb pressed up facing the forward direction you want to place your finger firmly on the strike wheel and strike it back well at the same time pushing down the actuator button causing the butane to ignite it looks something like this and you have a flame as you can see the flame it's around a 1.25 one and a quarter inches and there is no way to adjust it what you see is what you get so let us talk the good and the bad starting of course with the good the good is that the bic lighters have solid construction you'd be thinking whoa it's made of plastic does anyone you know ever complained about breaking a Bic lighter you lose these things before they break on you also as a nice flame it's soft which means it's absolutely perfect for toasting your cigars however it is small side so you might not be able to get the big sixties I'd say maybe a Churchill size at the most with this also it has a fuel window and now you may be thinking whoa hold on there Pat's why would you say there's a fuel window I've seen these things they have no such thing actually hold these up to the light and you can clearly see where the fuel is it might take a little bit of a bright light like the Sun or a bright LED we are definitely able to tell also it has a huge fuel reservoir like I said you'll lose these things before they break on you and you'll lose these things before you run out of fuel so all that being said if a Bic can somehow manage to tell me what fuel level I'm at why is it that these 50 and $100 lighters even $200 lighters don't have a fuel window no excuse its 2017 we need to see this fix the greatest innovator of all time oh I can't say that with a straight face probably probably good for lighters they're popular regardless also it stays cool after long toasting periods of time it will not get hot it'll get a little warm but nothing to a point where your recoiling your hand cuz you burned yourself and of course they're inexpensive they're a buck it makes fire what more do you want and onto the bad it's a small flame as you saw as I mentioned earlier you can't really toast your big ring sizes with it I'd say a churchill max ideally probably a corona like something maybe 42 issuing gauge would be the most you'd want to use it for but it still does what you need and you'll still toast them albeit it will take slightly longer than you would want also zero end resistance which of course is a property of every single soft flame lighter you can take it you just see a little whip around and it gets blown out fairly easily but again it's normal for a soft flame so that's just to be expected so the overall conclusion is this lighter totally recommended why not it's a dollar it lights up it's got a absolute ton of fuel in there and it does what you need unless you're smoking outside you don't need anything else you might want to get a torch but if you're smoking inside if you're doing something else I got started lighting my cigars with I've moved on now obviously but you know what it does the job and for the price you really can't beat it well that's all for today I hope you enjoyed this

just let me all the links to those are in the description pardon me and have yourself a very happy April Fool's Day", "r-xeEH-2FGg": "[Music] welcome back best unit crew it's a girl some time to do some riders using just cardstock and vinyl and mountain tape let's see mounting tape mounting tape I'll be using this here is the double-sided permanent tape paper and I got it from Hobby Lobby for no more than a dollar on twenty four cents you got some lighters I got from Dollar General no I think I got these from family dollars then they would no more like a dollar too but I think it was like a dollar so I got some hard stop I got from Walmart I use this once before in the video just a little corner stop you print on it you can print on it and I have I have this shimmery looking paper here I got from Michaels I don't know what a packaging it for them but it comes in a pack like this it's the same name by recollection and everything this one here is a glitter heart stopped coming like a four-season but I think I don't use majority of it so yeah so this just an idea for people that I can make the glitter - and it's pretty glittery it looks good and I got a sheet of pink rhino and I you know I'm just going to try it in just replicate it and put a name and all that good stuff on it sticker paper I was using also just very chic I had like all difficult little sheets so I'm gonna try to use this as a wrap method so we just don't play around fancy I'm just trying some stuff I'm also going try ain't bleeding a lighter I couldn't find my full sheet so I'm gonna make this do to do but alright let's get started okay guys my camera cut off when I got to this part here and I can't find the file cuz like you know he's just sucking I can't even run you down real quick on what I just did for this one I had I'll put the mountain tape on the back of it and then I put the vinyl on front of the glitter paper and I'm just gonna weed my name out just well it would be great and I'm wet while I'm doing it like this the vinyl won't come off of the finally lift it all up together so I just laid the whole piece down on here and now I'm gonna read it off here at that put the paper off it so like like I say it there's sizing so all the squares that I'm doing 2.45 width and height and how I got the perfect measurements for my name to fit inside the square is got a shape in Cricut design space and I put my name in it I thought sighs the squirts a 2.45 with in 2.45 height I just got my name and put it inside the square and I made sure it fit before I printed it cut it with the machine so this would be the first test so like I said I got the mountain paper on the bag I want to do is pull the paper off of it this back part right here you see just pulling this off so I'm just trying to give us about another idea of a lighter with the glitter because I don't like missile glitter so this would be a cute little idea for a glitter lighter you see keep you off from having to glitter so much if you think this is pretty okay so that is one the next step we're gonna do it again with just a mountain tape just okay so I want to do is just cut my image out and like I said every image every square room was 2.45 with 2.45 height it's what I measured it is from my lighter just my life this kind of lighter now I got another video called DIY lighters custom lighters or something like that and you got the wick for the big lighters on there but you can also Google you know what what some temperature side silver lighter and it will tell you the measurements you would need if you google it what's the regular size of a lot of template or somebody label a lighted label so this is my mountain tape again it has a shiny coat on the front it has like a shiny coat on the front and on the back is a dull so I'm gonna put my cut I don't know like I said I should have put it in the cricket and like later cut the shapes out for me in that way I won't have to do all this but uh I just measured with the picture that's already cut that meant then I'm just gonna cook but your cricket will cut it for you if you get a square and just make that square a 2.4 what 2.45 width and height and it'll cut it out for you that way you're already hammered out were to cut out so now I want to do is pour this shiny foot inside away from the door this right here you do not need it's the shiny side so now you place the sticky part onto your image in the end didn't make sure you get it on it real good okay I'm just gonna put a little backing off like a sticker okay this is the mountain take the mountain paper Maui Mountain IBC just place it what we wanted to go there we go pretty that's real good yeah and this is the glitter car stop that's pretty good or you can use like a double-sided tape but this is a double-sided tape but this here tapes the whole thing to the letter so I like this team found just a package in again I'll take my musing by paper studios and I got it from Hobby Lobby for a dollar and two and four snap so so far we made two cute little glitter lighters without making a mess so nothing cute right so yeah the light jumping like it should but it is only and this gorgeous and I use this paper here you buy this from Walmart no more the photos it's a glitter card stock that's pretty okay we're just gonna use a regular pretty paper you know change to color a lighter so this is something I got from Michaels told me it looks like the glitter card stock paper this is what I did this with these come from Michaels they I also have this holographic look at me thanks for - okay so same method with the mountain tape just go just pull it back and up get the sticky side and put the sticky side on your piece of paper you just scrape it take it off there place it on the writer and you can also put a name on there just place it down slide it over you know just a tweet which I think cute right you put a name here like I did the purple one okay another one real quick like I want to try to bling okay another one we have is this bling Skrill they used to come like bigger than these like a whole sheet like a 12 by 12 sheet almost but I used so much of this over the years I don't know where is that but you can find these at Michael's and this is I already have a sticking backing on it you can add more if you would like but me I'm not going to so what I'm going to do is just cut in layers because of its in script mine's came in scripts but they do have a sheet that's full and you can just made a whole sheet around and cut so just gonna cook and we're responsible for this measurement here because I don't have the whole sheet let me see I almost look right [Applause] like this eight was that Eva I'm good there and you got like a little roll you can cut through today baby have a whole lotta okay so we're gonna try to wrap wrap it around like I say they are already apart so that's gonna be the hard part life real cheap to see [Music] dang it you just tried to get him cross okay let's try to get him close as you can I forgot to pull their paper Oh he's looking good so far like there may be trapped each other not to break so home close as possible just wrap it around [Music] okay this think about these here just cuz they got their little eye so if we get to the end and it's too long you can just go between there and cut that's the best part about voila it's gonna better better day look at that yeah no can tell me there's not pretty so we got a bling you got four different lines just that quickly so use your imagination you can do whatever yeah I have a blessed one yeah every day [Music]", "mRE25WwIHk8": "welcome to the intermittent gentlemen and today is the 45th day check of the zippo style survivor lighter long-term review additionally today we are going to do a little bit of a deep dive on the supris zippo case if you look back a link will be provided in the description on the 30th day check we did a deep dive into the ethereum pyrovault zippocase so let's get to it and take a look at these lighters and see how they're doing at day so just a quick run through here on the lighters we'll do a light check so you can see a couple strikes or attempts but the theorem is still lighting the supress additionally on the second light is still lighting as well and you saw with both of the zippo cases the lids were a little bit stuck maybe a manual open but i think now that they've been opened after a little bit of storage they are good to just flip open with the press of their button just a little bit of an annotation on the theorem i mentioned that my lid did not spring open the whole way with the the release of the switch here i took a little bit of lubricating oil and just touched up and then blew out with some pressurized air the spring here as well as on the inside and you can now see that my theorem does open with enough clearance to successfully light the later the exotec titan light all good there the regular zippo has the vector thunderbird butane insert in and then the amazon generic peanut lighter lights up as well additionally on day 45 i subjected all of these lighters except for the vector that's just sitting in a regular zippo case to a water test so let's cut to the water test and see how that went all right so we're here with the water test in order to test the water resistance of these lighters and lighter cases i submerged them for 24 hours in a water pitcher overnight now of course i did not submerge the vector thunderbird insert that is just sitting in a normal civil case this does not offer any water resistance it doesn't advertise any water resistance so no testing there but let's see how they did so let's take a look at the theorem pyrovault now one thing about the theorem pyrovault that i did not mention um in my individual review of it is if you can see there this spring is exposed for the switch here so thinking about corrosion if you were to have one of these submerged or exposed to water for a long time what exposed metal parts are there so the spring as well as the pin hinge for the lid uh the pin here that holds the switch as well as the spring for the switch so let's see it's not opening on its own a little pull there you can see that the o-ring held up pretty well some moisture around the edge a little bit of moisture inside the lid there could have been from just opening it just now but the wick appears dry and we'll give it a spark okay so tough to get a spark off could be my fingers uh wetting the wheel as i'm going there so we have the the theorem after 24 hours and about 10 inches of water there let's take a look at the supress here so the supress exposed metal parts are going to be this hinge extra safety latch or secure latch pin holding the button in the push button itself a pin holding the latch here and most likely water getting in here into the internal spring mechanism as well so if i just give it a push flicks open and it looks like the spring for the hinge may not get as much exposure to water there as you can see compared to the theorem be on the outside but through this pin slot i'm sure moisture is getting in there still too looking at through the lens let's say it appears that there's less moisture around the the edge here than there was on the theorem let's give this a spark and see what happens all right no flame there again probably from my uh my wet thumb here against the striker wheel let's take a look at the amazon keychain peanut lighter here so screw off the top here we go get it to focus all right there we go and we got a flame on the peanut lighter all right let's take a look at the exotec titan light and you know what because i forgot to draw my hands off from the very start with the theorem i'm not going to draw my hand off here either just going to unscrew the lid take a look at the level of moisture or lack thereof for the exotec titan light and just gonna give it a spark and there we go flame on the first try so to no surprise the two lighters with screw down caps and o-rings whether this one being a little exposed the x attack uh an inner seam o-ring but the screw-down lids fared a lot better than we saw with the two flip top lids now in a situation where your lighter needed to be waterproof whether it was raining really hard or maybe you're doing some water sports like kayaking or canoeing or just uh on the lake or waiting in the water doing some fly fishing and you needed to use your lighter most likely you would dry your hand off before using and probably dry the outside of the case off anyway before using but we saw with the two flip top lid lighters that even though we could get a spark not quite getting a flame there with theorem and with this supress now we do have a flame and i was just uh using my my left hand here that's uh stayed a little bit drier throughout the the check i'm curious let me um let me try this this supers again here uh three or four tries now we're getting the flame i would probably chalk up the the first attempts on the theorem and the supress something to do with you know using the hand i'm going in to grab the lighter with uh striking the flint wheel but on the other hand we did have success with that same same variable staying consistent with the amazon piano lighter as well as the exotech titan light so take that data point uh for what for what you will and uh let's get back to the long term review welcome back from the water test as you saw the theorem and the supress were having some trouble striking and again i believe that was because i was using uh the hand i submerged into the pitcher of water and was getting the striking our flint wheel wet uh while i was trying to light it again the theorem and the peanut lighter though still lit regardless of that wet thumb now additionally the the theorem is i think on its last leg so i did already weigh the lighters and i will annotate in the description below uh but the theorem has lost um more significant weight compared to the other lighters and you'll probably see in the five-second burn that i i do believe the theorem is on its last leg so i i do believe that if it was filled with lighter fluid and took a took a dunk in the in the water there that it would still be able to light successfully uh very similar to how the super is performed i would uh suggest though that if your lighter does take a dunk dry off your hands as well as just dry off the outer case before you open it and expose the internals to getting possibly wet let's take a deeper dive into the superus zippo case now with the supras here it's very similar to the therm where it's a zippo case only made out of a polymer material now this polymer feels a little bit different than the theorem this feels more like an abs hard plastic whereas the theorem here is more of that ubiquitous injected molded polymer this feels a little bit more brittle but i think on day 60s test we'll do a drop test and we'll see how they hold up now additionally with the supers um it is you do have a lanyard hole it is a spring loaded lid with a push button but the supers has an additional wire safety latch if you will now two things this probably does is going to be prevent the button or if the button is actuated in your pocket or in your bag the light is not going to fly open additionally when you do close it it does feel like it's giving a little bit more downward pressure for a better seal against those o-rings for possibly more longevity from an evaporation of fuel standpoint as well as increased barrier resistance to water mud sand etc now the superus is a foreign made i believe coming out of china whereas the theme is made in the usa the supress as well though might be a better value on average on amazon the supers in this camo pattern or a flat black sits usually around 12 for just the case whereas the theorem is coming in at thirty dollars squared off base so easy to sit down don't have to think about it we'll sit upright within the packaging of the supress it also came with a lanyard as well as a whistle that i have purposed elsewhere but it was a nice touch to to come with a lighter now both of these cases do kind of face the same inherent or design dependent flaw if you will and i'm gonna turn the theorem over to the uh to the correct way that maybe i got a right-handed user would hold it so we're talking about the lid flipping to the left here when you're using the striker wheel the buttons may get in the way a bit you can see the themes as well as the supers here meaning when you're striking the wheel your thumb is going to hit the switch and then on the serum using both lighter cases and it may not seem like a significant amount or significant difference between the two here but i would say that in use you feel like you get a a closer to 100 strike 100 strike on the supress than you do with a theorem maybe only a matter of millimeters there that the the safety latch or the latch is is above the body of the lighter it's definitely less noticeable on the super slow overall i think the supress is a better buy than the theorem so far throughout testing at day 45 based on the weight of the lighters from day zero as well as just observing the flame strength the super seems to be holding up better in the long term than the theorem when it comes to fuel evaporation additionally some of the features like the square base as well as the additional safety catch i believe um wins it between the therm and the superus the price is a huge contributing factor um twelve dollars for the supers and camo or black compared to thirty dollars for the theorem and i don't think the theorem is providing double or over uh over double the the value or the features that the the supers is now if buying american made is a big deal then the theorem is going to be your choice because it is made in the usa but let's wrap this one up and get to the five second burn and here we are for the five second burn and you can see barely that therm is hanging on with just a flame down below the chimney at the base of the wick now that we're back from the five second burn i would say that the therm is on its last leg i'm not quite sure that it's going to make it to the 16-day mark now i will include it just for the final word that it is completely evaporated all its fuel additionally i'd like to include it in the drop test as well i'm not going to call it quits for the 45 day check because the theorem was still hanging in there especially with the first two seconds of the light and then it the flame dwindled down to below the chimney just a small blue flame right by the wick not the theorem is a bad zippo case by any means it definitely has prolonged the life of a normal zippo insert upwards of 30 to 45 may be pushing 50 days the theorem will still give you the ability to have a flame we'll see where the others stand at day 60. again check the description for updated weights as well and in the meantime stay a gentleman intermittently of course", "yKmZEdAzC1c": "so she probably guessed by the title of this video and these lighters stood in front of me I'm gonna be showing you three really cool tricks that we can do with lighters one of them is going to be a life hack useful trick and the other two are gonna be sort of magic tricks that you can show your friends and those sorts of things without being said let's jump straight in start with first one I've got the light levels a lot lower than they usually are that's because what I want you to see is how amazing this trick really is so what you're going to do is tell your friends I bet you I could make a fireball come out my hands and then watch this so we're gonna do it's gonna take a lighter just a normal lighter like that and I'm gonna turn the gas all the way high all right I'm gonna fill the gas up into my hand like so and then did you see that don't know if you saw that let's do it again watch this did you see that how amazing was that that literally was warm but I didn't feel anything so that's the first trick let's move on to the next one so what we're gonna do for this one is make sparks come from your hand as if they're coming from nowhere it's really dead simple this one so I'm going to do is grind it onto my finger up side down without actually hitting it fast enough to make the Flint spark so what's doing is collecting the Flint powder onto my hand on the more specifically onto the nail so what you want to hold your thumb like that and when you show someone the trick just like look I bet I could make sparks come from my thumb out of nowhere so you hold your lights like that you want to turn your flame up and then watch this isn't over you see this and you go did you see those it's quite amazing like it one more time for you you light your lighter like so you say watch this did you see that that was amazing did you see all the sparks fly in the air there's just that simple again really easy trick you know anyone can do it denial is very cool so let's jump down to the next one okay so this one might seem really simple but is actually super effective and I saved saved my butt many times all you do heat up your glue like so get someone to your surface stick your two objects together like so I mean that's really it just blown it look at that that's stuck really well and that's it just carry that around with you it's as simple as that definitely recommend this is this one's really really good you know it's gonna be as strong as the hot as hot glue is you know and a pinches it's great hope you enjoyed the video leave a like if you want and hope see you next time enjoy", "bk_b3QvNjUA": "the tradition of songs were sung Pez since the launch of its first pocket lighter in 1973 Vic has produced and sold 30 billion lighters we currently produce about 6 million lighters every day Cemal bear mouse NB it's my father Marcel B who chose the shape of the bic lighter he wanted it to fit the hand perfectly indeed our first advert for lighters was bic lighter your hand will make a difference he a Google project bic is the world's biggest manufacturer of branded pocket lighters what we refer to as quality safety is Bix number one priority from the basic concept of the bic lighter to its production with integrated controls we want to offer our consumers the safest lighter now there are four factories that produce speck lighters around the world they are located in France Spain the United States and Brazil the guy today the public official the particularity of our lighter manufacturing process is that it is completely integrated from the conception of the molds machines and tools to the assembly line and final control of the products and our machines this is the starting point of the safety of bic lighters what i call sexual affair we use the best raw materials the best components and the best manufacturing process is to design and manufacture our lighters we're coating the calories the lighter body is made of a technical resin the Delrin it is a poly acetyl Homa polymer a crystalline material very resistant to ruptures impacts and high temperatures in addition this material enables us to make a lighter body with very thin linings which in the end increases the number of lights for the consumer well the weekend geez all thanks to the use of isobutane a pure gasps the gas pressure and bic lighters is stable this ensures the steadiness of the flame which is the same height during the whole life of the lighter we are leaders in safety because we use a cold stamping process for the manufacturing of the valve body by using a pure electrolytic aluminium wire this cold stamping process guarantees the stability of the shape to the hundredth of a millimeter and the complete absence of chips in the parts produced our main strengths regarding safety resides in the use of the zinc alloy die casting it consists in injecting liquid metal at 400 degrees Celsius into high-precision molds these molds guarantee a very precise cast to the hundredth of a millimeter and the complete absence of chips in the parts produced to week 8 though what we put as a lighter is potentially dangerous it must comply with very strict international safety standards ad pick we have decided to exceed these standards while the standard requires that a lighter resist three drops from a height of 1.5 meters our products actually resist drops from a height of 3 meters while the standard requires that a lighter resist a temperature of 65 degrees Celsius for 4 hours our lighters actually resist a temperature of 75 degrees while the standard requires that a lighter resist an internal pressure of 15 bars the bodies of our lighters actually resist an internal pressure of up to 30 bars the bic lighter is a world leader for its quality efficiency and quality safety our lighters are known as the best in terms of quality of use and safety we will continue to focus on quality safety in the future this is a necessity for consumers this is big strength and this is a characteristic on which low quality lighters will never be able to compete with us you", "-Y1HRPP7-eE": "what's up everybody I want to talk about lighting options in this video what you can see here are I think the most common things that make fire matches and lighters now I wanted to incorporate a lighter and my EDC for a long time but I was just not able to find a suitable well item for that and I have a Zippo slim just filled it up but I don't like um gas filled or well Zippo gas filled lighters basically because it evaporates quite quickly and I don't use a lighter every single day because I'm not a cigarette smoker I don't smoke cigars every day I don't smoke pipes every day and this is one thing I don't have on the table a pipe lighter and what else don't I have I don't have a torch lighter you know those flambe torch lighter things and the jet lighter so this one isn't a lighter as well but this is supposed to represent those peanut lighters you can fill up with gas and lighter fluid um I don't like those because they are too small for me I think you don't have the real estate and yeah those are the lighters I don't want to carry even though I have them except for this one this is not a lighter and so I came across those big cases and I'm gonna talk about those in just a minute so this is a small mini big lighter this one is a large big lighter just to give you a size comparison I have this leather sleeve or large lighters but the big lighter is a little bit too slim for it and although I like the feel of leather I don't like to use flammable stuff with stuff that make fire so what this is just the cheap gas station lighter this one fits in there really nice but those are very cheap lighters ver very poorly made and I don't like those because you can you can break that those in half if you want to so this is what a friend forgot in my back after we went camping this is the same thing I got here this is a big mini metal case this one is from Marlborough and I don't really mind but those things are promotional items I think he got his this one has got some really cool use out of it he's a cigarette smoker I think he got that one in a bar when people came to that bar and promoted ma bra but gave out some some some what some of those sliders and some matches and I really like that and it's really heavy you can see how thick that is you have a hole on the bottom and the lighter goes right in there slips in there from the top and if you want to take it out you can just use the punch of Swiss Army knife for example but be aware not to thrust too hard in their bottoms are still made out of plastic so this one is one I got from eBay as well also from Marlboro really nice doesn't fit a big lighter you can see it's just a little bit smaller and wider on the top not so much but the lighter that comes in there of course doesn't work so I hope I will find a lighter that fits in there if not I paid three or four bucks and flush them down the drain so those out of the way because I don't carry those as EDC lighters those I don't so big lighters big big lighters they're nice whole lot of fluid I like lightest you can just throw away and not refill them but simply be simply the touch to it the plastic II I don't like that on the big look on the small big lighter I don't like it as well so I got those things and matches of course who carries metal pipe smokers maybe but I don't smoke a pipe every day as I told you so those things are just amazing this one is the heaviest out of the bunch this one's from L&M it has a subdued kind of tactical looking black on black i'm theme it's a little bit thinner its rounded this one is square and it feels very matte and rubbery but it's it's metal it's it's really nice and this one will be my my carry my EDC carry lighter for the next couple of days weeks maybe the reason why I carry a lighter is not only because of me but I have a lot of friends that smoke and well you guessed that right they don't have lighters all the time and it kind of goes on my nerve so if I have fire it yeah I'm just one who wants to to help people that's just me so the this is my daily carry for the future and this one is also a maul bro one this one is amazing customer each of those three cost me around 250 shipped from eBay I've been tracking the internet for a while now at least for a couple of weeks and I wanted to find some some of those lighter cases and just recently a seller offered some on eBay and I grabbed a bunch of those so you can hear very positive snap it's also made out of metal it's square looks a little bit yeah yeah like a very very expensive lighter but a big mini goes in there and the way you get that out with the small hole on the bottom it's kind of hard you can just use pliers I'm use the one on my leather man and you can just take those out with pliers so very nice and I think thickness wise force my tour Knox thickness wise those are not too bad this is Victorinox climber has three rows of tools so not overly thick in comparison to a Bic lighter exactly the same width and a big lighter alone a Zippo lighter I mean and a Bic lighter is just a tad thinner of course you can see that in there the metal that's around it so I really like those things and I'm glad I found those so if you if you ever see things like that on the internet and don't know why why you should get it or shouldn't get it get those this is why I made this video those things are durable as [ __ ] those are really hard use items very very strong thick metal really really nice do you have some heft in your pocket which I like I don't like those incredibly light lighters so try to get those if you want lighting options in your EDC rotation certainly doesn't hurt and I thank you for watching have a good night goodbye", "t7eIG_3qMBI": "what's up guys this is black Scout survival and today we're talking about what is the best survival lighter and you know I've tried a lot of different lighters on the markets the high-tech survival gadgety ones ass butane you know that waterproof whatnot just never none of them really you know sparked my interests up at this point you know I'm not saying that out they never will you know but at this point I'm going to go with mold stand by the big lighter and in my fire kit I carry two cigarette lighters alone you know fair seeing on some other things and I'll do a bit on that kit in the future but I kind of just want to talk about some the like big lighters and lighters the I guess myths of these lighters and stuff like that people really say they're unreliable and I'm not really sure why they must have never used them but uh this is the general kind that you can find in most places you notice the Flint will and I carried these in Montana I've been to Montana numerous times and I carry these up in elevation and they work fine people say oh they don't work in you know high altitude but I was in high altitude and in middle of January when it was like 20 below zero and these work fine people say they freeze well the fact is is yet you keep them in your pack like I'll snuff my billing in Montana and I had like mine out now gene in my bag and my backpack and uh the water froze you know but if you keep this close to your body like in your pocket past park or whatnot it's going to stay warm and even if it does freeze up you know or get cold you can warm it up and it'll work well the other fact is is that people say they're not waterproof well that is true they're not waterproof you get them wet and I'm going to show that in a minute you're getting whether or not immediately gonna work at the blow mount drying out and all that kind of stuff so yeah but I said I carry two lighters and there's a reason why this is a flint wheel style and you know like I have been talking about it can get wet not work but this is a bit click and it is a piee zo piezo I'm guessing lighter and so it's an electronic lighter this thing will work when it's wet and I'm going to show that in a few minutes but while I'm still on this lighter people say that this also you know you run up lose fuel in it with us whenever I you know put an o-ring on there a ring guys get bring this in closer but a ring gasket like this right here and keep it from you know depressing and I keep them on my pack like this so that way I know it's not getting to press them up high but anyhow I normally carry the large size version of the cigarette lighter you know these bit clicks I only see them coming this size here I tend to stay away from this size you know unless I'm currently in my pocket on a daily basis but you know it's just getting too much bigger than this one and that kind of stinks but like I said this is only size that I've seen this one come in and I generally I tend to you know stick with orange lighters as my survival lighters that way I know never to use these lesser and small situations all my other color lighters I use for whatever reason but anyhow I also have the piezo and oranges also so the piezo lighter was going to move this another way the piezo lighter is this is also a piezo type lighter you know the grill grill lighter and these are good to have too but they're big you know not really good for carrying around on your person but basically this thing takes an electric like art and it ignites the the fuel and you can kind of see it jump out there but these things work great and I'll show you real quick you can dunk them in water and they'll lighten immediately up will dump both of these and some water standard and a bit click and you're probably asking well why don't you carry two of the bit clicks then instead of this Flint style the problem is with the piezo like I said is they don't work well in altitude something to do with the arc of the the spark is what hits a quartz and spark it just doesn't ignite or flake off in a constitute so this is the good to have and these are large you know what I mean these are small so this obviously holds more fuel the other benefit of carrying these over these is that you can use this Flint style even when the fluid runs out okay I'm going to do a video on that in the future or you can remove the cap and using like a spark light so so there's benefits to both and that's why I carry one of each in my kit it's a you know work off each other in case one of them fails I don't work alright so let's go ahead and do this let's go ahead and see if this is going to work no all right a little bit of drying out that won't work let's go ahead and try this one up oh that worked didn't it the meeting stick this thing in here all day I'm telling you but where I think a few times to get it but it's going to work instead I mean so you may just have to shake the water out of it as all you know but it's going to work and it's going to get the job done so to me this is your best survival lighter combo you know why make things difficult whenever you cannot just take a you know use Pharisee and write a lot to this and that I use it in tough conditions but why not just you get out and I get a fire started but this was black Scouts Volcom check out our tips and tutorials on our website and if you have to subscribe please subscribe and as always thanks for watching", "pHIBXbtVi38": "Oh guys well today we're talking about lighters that's right I got a couple of my layers couple of my wife's lighters we talked about things we like things we don't like there's one lighter here that I don't like at all and neither does she we we all use all these lighters or we use them for well mostly cigars my wife candles she's very much into candles and stuff but we both use them for miscellaneous projects burning paracord who knows what whatever you'd need a flame for so her lighters are over here she has these three these are my two most recently carried and most carried in general and these two we both kind of both use all right this is excluding table lighters I'm just talking about populate errs here so um yeah let's get into it first off we'll talk about my layers this is the one I most recently used in the cigar video this is a vector this one is pretty interesting it has a kind of a trap door that opens up to like this you're pushing down on this so as I push down you can see those open up they start to hinge open okay and then obviously all the way down we have a triple flame and what's interesting too is I did a video on the flat flame lighter now it's a single flat flame extremely unique very different this still has a flat plane but it's from three different burners so as you could probably see I put it against the black box you know it's still making kind of a a long flat plane by using again three different you know individual burners okay so three cylindrical flames together obviously in a row mix a flat flame works almost every time as you can see there a misfire I guess you could say basically when you're opening this up be a little spark and sometimes a spark will jumped and hit the frame or something that's why it doesn't light this is very common with a lot of different layers out there but I think it's a great value this one came from buy lighters actually this vector that xikar this hurricane lighter and as well as this other vector or enhance another vector all from by lighters so as far as these I'm gonna give you that that price that's where I got them from but this vector 65 bucks 65 bucks is not cheap it is definitely a better quality lighter it has you know extreme heft it's very heavy solid metal it's cool design its unique it does have kind of gimmicky cutters in here it's two different punch cutter is a small one and a large one all right although these are functional you know they do work you just I always suggest you have to keep some pressure so say here's your cigar hold it back here the user cigar make your cut you'll be fine but if you just let it sit like this and try cutting it you know it's just wobbly it's all it's got a tiny bit of play in it I've never really used a cutter from a lighter as a dedicated cutter you know I mean because they all eventually just get loose because there's just a little little pin in there holding it in so it's not you know super secure anything but again if you support the back of it and use appropriate pressure you should never really have a problem so it's good to have as a backup but maybe not a dedicated cutter but yes so you have a small punch cut and a large punch cut which is kind of cool obviously someone who might invest in a more expensive lawyer would be you know cigar guy anyway or cigar woman because there are a lot of females out there that smoke but uh yeah so pretty interesting I like it a lot 65 bucks I do think it's uh it's worth the money if you want to invest in a good lighter and of course having that nice wide flame it's very easy to light up your cigars so next up for me is of course my 1935 replica Zippo this has the outside hinge a little bit shorter of a top here much squared off design from the original I'm just a classic lighter you really can't go wrong it I love all zip boats all zippers all sizes all colors all you know designs it's a great way to express yourself because they're literally just thousands and thousands of different Zippo designs so whatever you're into whatever you like you can find a Zippo that appropriately pitch you you know if you like a certain band like a lot I'm sure they have that logo on a Zippo yeah I mean if you um I don't know if you're gothic you can get is about skulls on it you know if you're I don't know like a hippie dippie guy you can get you know a tie-dye suppo or you know the spectrum you know Zippo or whatever there's just a Zippo for everyone put it that way wherever you are wherever you represent as a person your hobbies your interests all that stuff there's a simple for you they're affordable to you know like Zippos range anywhere from 10 bucks to a super plain-jane one all the way up to let's just say fifty fifty dollars and I'm talking in the United States to I know there are people outside the US that like Zippos and they tell me oh man you know you go there for 25 bucks we got to pay $85 u.s. or whatever the equivalent would be you know they are so that's you know it's unfortunate obviously however I will say this you guys have all the great chocolate you know American chocolate stinks so it doesn't matter where you are if you're outside of America your chocolates probably better so can't win them all right so yeah you have expenses as if owes but cheap delicious chocolate and I know the food but anyway yeah so like as far as pricing I'm really talking about the u.s. because that's really my only experience but uh yeah hippos I mean there's just so many different designs and they're affordable let's just say on average 25 bucks you know if you find a Ram Zippo it's probably around 25 bucks so as if those are so awesome why isn't everyone carry one well I think there's two major reasons number one has to be it loses fuel you can fill it up today two weeks from now it's empty even if you didn't use it why it's just because there's not an airtight seal here so the fluid is just sitting in there and it's slowly evaporating you know through the cracks in between you know the the case and the lid here so yeah a lot of people don't like that including myself I don't like the fact that I'd fill it with today and use it a little bit kind of forget about it you know I got to fill it again so that kind of stinks but number two which a lot of people don't think about because not a lot of people are bothered by it but some people are the smell I happen to love the way a zipless smells I love lighter fluid you know it's one of those weird smells people like people why people like some really weird smells I mean some people get off on smelling gasoline nothing too high or anything but just they like the smell stalks some people like the small skunks and a lot of other you know unmentionable smells we're not gonna have a discussion about smells right now but there's a lot of your people that like some weird smells but some people are very turned off by the smell of Isobel specifically visible fluid okay so uh yeah Zippos they're on the road awesome that collect so many of them but based outside yet to constantly fill them and that cost you money you keep buying later for all time oh yeah I mean staying on a theme of Zippo zzzz are to suppose of my my wife own this one is an antique brass one okay and as you can see it doesn't have a standard insert is there a full-size of bo because she also has a pistol in here and this one has just the Z plus insert which needs some fuel but that is her for butane flame so when she wants a little torch flame but in a cool old Zippo style that's what she grabs and consistent this is the one she'll keep in her purse because you know it'll always work right or at least probably will work those E Plus inserts are kinda you know half and half I mean I want to try the I don't think I've ever had the vector vector makes a very similar insert and the vector seems to be a good quality company overall at least with the layers I pad I mean both of these are vectors and I like but anyway maybe in the future we'll do side-by-side or something if I ever get one but besides that this is the first lighter that I gave her when we were dating I gave this to her actually doesn't have the original insert the original insert was also brass but this is just a Zippo slim okay and you could say it's slimmer this is originally you know designed for women with smaller hands right little petite lighter so she loves these but when she wants to go traditional so grab that one and obviously that one for convenience as far as her although later the lighter that she loves the most right here is a is a car later they pronounce that comes a nice box nice paperwork and stuff and this is I car I think sells for 30 bucks or so and they have a bunch of different colors she likes to clear one but she likes everything about this later first off you can see how much fluid left no mistaking that with the clear body it has a cap so the burners aren't going to get dirty or get lint or dust or anything in them it's very easy to use and that was a big thing to her is how easy it is to push the button okay so it really takes very little pressure to use this lighter and you can see it has a nice beautiful big old flame and what's cool about this one too is that the entire base rotates to adjust your flame you don't have to get in there with a little screwdriver alright so keep this going and literally just turn it up all the way down to conserve fuel for summer in the milk alright so easy to use a light button and as you can see it works I think this one is ever misfired ever so for 30 bucks that's a very very cool lighter so if you're in the market for a single you know torch lighter butane I definitely recommend this one alright time to talk about the hurricane that's what this one's called the hurricane it's 12 bucks um my wife and I wanted to try this one out because it had a quad flame okay four different burners for different ways such as you could see creates one giant flame okay which is super cool here's the thing though we both hate this later um first of all it's very inconsistent I had a lot of problems with it when I first got it I filled it up and it was kind of clogged up and I use the same fuels everyone else I always used the Zippo blue simple blue excuse me butane but I don't have it I do resort to the Ronson but you know generally I do like using a Zippo blue but anyway yeah I had some problems with this lighter it wasn't working it took me a long time to purge it properly purging just you know pushing down on the valve on the bottom to let all the gas out if you don't know when you fill a butane lighter you're supposed to get all the gas out first so you don't pray any air bubbles on the line and so it doesn't get all clogged up so I purged it properly and it wasn't working for a while I finally got it back working but I still have some issues with it my wife's biggest issue is this button is extremely hard to push down it actually hurts their thumb okay and you can't see from the video and if I had a trigger pull measurement I could tell you how much weight this is if I had to guess if you know for the gun guys out there this is a trigger pull and say it's probably a seven or eight pound trigger pull which is ridiculous for later this would be your you know trigger job on your revolver or something it's just like a one petal trigger pull okay it's nothing this one is extremely hard to push down okay and then we're to the cap also equally difficult to shut now you can push the button out a little bit to shut it which makes it easier because you can see this metal piece is what it's grabbing on to so they puts that down first it helps a little but then you're losing gas if you listen I have to lose gas every time I go to shut it so obviously I don't want to do that so it's very hard to push okay already had some problems with it for me this is my big issue my wife's was obviously the button but for me this metal piece that keeps the cap closed you can see it comes down and it sits right there just see it see the metal guess what it works like a heat sink it gets extremely hot so let me show you from right now it's called barely been used in the liner right lighting it let's just suppose I'm laying a cigar which I was doing recently it's getting hot to tip my thumb very hot okay I have to literally let go because it's burning my thumb so this piece here like I said acts like a heat sink and on the inside is starting to warm up and now we just have this this metal you know piece probably a little piece of stainless or something that's that's getting red-hot in there and it literally burns my thumb I can't I can't hold this long enough to to light a cigar fully like a normal sized cigar so like you're like cigarette boom it is literally or whatever but if you're using this for cigar I would imagine if you're buying a quad flame you know butane lighter you're probably lighting a cigar it just burns your finger I just can't keep it on long enough I have to literally and especially once it gets that hot you have to wait for it to cool down so I just don't like it and by the way I mean this came with it said something on here like a sticker things fell off like the first day it literally just a like vinyl sticker or something like that fell off the sticker on the backside had so much glue on it that was a huge pain to get off I will say one thing though there'll be something positive right got to be optimistic I love that to adjust this flame there's a little lever here so you gives you a little knob to put your fingernail pop that up as you can see this rotates back and forth so that's how you adjust your flame which is pretty cool I do like that turn it down but that's too low I go okay so yeah off getting hot getting high now come on can't shut the lid so yeah I mean that's that's the positive is that little thing I think that if you don't have something like this we can rotate the whole knob you should definitely have something like that so that's cool I do like that and again it's 12 bucks you know it works it's just not all the time it gets too hot when it's lit for lighting a cigar anyway maybe you have a different purpose for this later but yeah I don't know it's just just cheap really cheap I mean it really fails compared to these other butane lighters so anyway I mean you know it is what it is so I mean it is 12 bucks and it's got to be one of the cheapest if not the cheapest quadruple burner lighters or quad flames okay having four burners and interferring that one huge giant claim most lighters that are set up like that the quad layers are expensive so there's that there's always that but yeah I mean between the problems I had and just being so difficult to use and literally causing you you know discomfort you know I mean I don't want to have a bird finger or it doesn't have a sore finger trying to you know click it open it's just one of those things so that leaves us with this guy this is the vector kgm okay so is for 20 bucks on violators calm and this one comes with a bunch of different colors I have to like the all you know kind of satin stainless look here but a pretty unique lighter if I both share this it unfortunately it's been a little inconsistent with the lighting on the lower flame setting you have to kind of set this high for to to light up each time what I noticed that when I set it a little bit lower to conserve some of the fuel it just wasn't lighting you know I just quickly click and the gases coming out fine but it wasn't that spark wasn't doing it so just something I've noticed but it's just an awesome design huge viewing window right in the front here so you can see how much fuel you have left the buttons on the top here when you push in slowly that pops out you're all the way down exhale it's a little inconsistent there but we have our nice jet flame and when you let go we have our soft flame so you have your butane flame right you're strong torch flame or you let go and again we have our soft wings like one of my cigarette or something or maybe you want to light a pipe because of the design here you can certainly use this as a pipe lighter which is awesome and then you can see there's a rubber pad on the end to grip that firmly to close this because obviously it's where the flame in scene I want to fool around or slip and you know burn yourself so pretty cool design I mean I really like this one you can hold this pretty much any way if you want to again light a pipe or something I kind of I kind of use this like this with my thumb maybe you can use it like this and if you wanted to I guess depends on your lighting but it's just awesome to have the dual flame you know option if you want a soft flame or if you want the butane torch flame but as you can see there again this is on a higher or setting because I played the saw flames too big I really want it down lower I want it like this but when I do that it just it's not consistent and it probably clicks you know 15 20 times before you hit the light and that's no bueno for me so yeah but that's again the vector kgm so my wife and I both kind of go back and forth you know claiming that neither it's not really either of ours we just both share but we do really share everything so she just has certain things that are hers certain things are mine but we all kind of mix and match and use it all but anyway I just wanted to do a video talking about you know some of these lighters I know I've had questions about this one already just from posting the video I think was yesterday on the order of posting these but yeah and just want to talk about Zippos in general twos if those are just awesome collectibles great lighters approvement is obviously it's been through every war you know since its creation in 1932 it's in like a thousand movies it's just an iconic piece of Americana the Zippo lighter you know and it just works it works it's definitely not wind proof I know they've been claiming that since back in the day but the flame definitely blows out with a good gust of wind but it's wind resistant good enough for me right yeah that's pretty much it so I want you guys to comment down below tell me if you Eve you see you later what lighter you EDC if it's a Zippo tell me what the design is just because and as long as it both you know let me know what brand and model if you happen to know you could just say butane later if you don't know and I will comment right now on Bix because a lot of people are going to say hey what's wrong with a $1 big lighter absolutely nothing there's nothing wrong with the big lighter they work they're very consistent they actually last a long time before they run out of fuel so you can't really say like oh well you know Rhino fuel II can't refill them they're usually a dollar sure I mean and again tons of designs these days and with our culture stuff there's all kinds of crazy designs on dick lighters so you can express yourself with them too but it's just kind of blah everyone has a bit lighter you know not everyone carries a Zippo and certainly most people don't have these butane lighters and they do it's not the same one you have so I always think it's cool being a little bit unique but I do want to say there is nothing wrong with a classic big layer they work and work well so anyway that's it looking forward to the comments again want to know what everyone else is carrying out there and what you use it for as well as tell me different different ways you use your layer besides obviously lighting cigarettes and cigars and whatever else you guys relating where you're smoking I should say but you know candles burning strings off of shirts you know who knows what just warming something up I'd love to hear your ideas for using lighters because maybe you'll give me a suggestion for another reason to use my lighter which maybe I'm using something else instead anyway that's all thanks for watching guys hope you have a wonderful day and I will see you soon take care", "R7ocGkyg-g4": "we had a feeling we weren't the only ones that had issues with existing lighters tired of burning ourselves we decided to do something about it so we set out to design our own looking at the market nothing addressed our need or style we asked ourselves how can we make the pocket lighter better we spent hours designing and redesigning engineering prototyping and repeating we were back at the drawing board often but only to make sure that we got everything right every detail mattered to us materials size and especially economics after nearly two years of design and engineering we've created something that we're truly proud of a premium solution that makes you ask yourself why didn't I think of it introducing the disome inverted lighter our patent-pending circle grips allows for igniting in the upright or inverted position while inverted the angled flame port creates a natural and ergonomic hamon to easily direct the flame where you want it the flame adjustment wheel makes it easy to set the perfect flame height the refillable butane tank makes sure you'll never have to throw another lighter in a landfill we're so confident in our product we've even backed it by a lifetime warranty we need your help to bring this project to life learn more and back our project below", "eGm93mNZcy8": "okay so here I have a disposable pic lighter this is the kind that has the four to six inch barrel on the end extended reach so you can get like a charcoal grill or maybe a low-lying candle wick without burning your hands your fingers this one in particular doesn't work anymore the spark is still good but if you look at the level indicator on the fluid we can see that it's bone-dry I thought it was kind of silly to throw these things away and spend another 4 to 6 bucks for a new one so I thought well maybe we can make it reusable or or find a way to refill it with our own butane canister so first we're going to do is we'll take a screwdriver and remove the only screw holding the two pieces together tap it out and take a flat blade screwdriver running it along the scene here to break the seal that's holding it together it's just glue and a few plastic pins and if we get inside we can get at the reservoir if we look at it looks oddly enough like a cigarette lighter right so there's a couple differences that I'm gonna go over those first thing you want to do is disassemble a new lighter by removing the windscreen the Flint wheel spring and Flint and now we can get a better look at it and see that they're almost the same if we take the fork spring and jet off the new lighter and keeping that upright take the fork spring and jet off the old lighter the only difference really is the jet the jet off the extended handle lighter is a bit taller so they can reach in and actually get into the barrel so we don't really need this stuff anymore off a new lighter but we will keep these components from the old lighter so we'll go back and reinsert it the old jet into the new lighter spring the fork we put all back together do a quick functions check you can reinsert it in the body just make sure that the end of the fork or the button is in line with the trigger open it up slide it back in so it seats it's not really difficult you've got to get it into the filled cavity and then close it up with a screw but um if everything works right you like so just put the screw back in there and if you want you can even run a little bit of glue on the end some sign of acrylic or crazy superglue button up until it's a dead again and then you can just repeat the process a little bit money so anyway hope you liked it", "e6zlrNY5G98": "this is a video about modifying the mini bic lighter does everything I need in a lighter about the only thing the bigger one might be better at is popping a beer bottle top off but for the most part for my needs since I'm not a smoker the little one has as much capacity as I could possibly want and they're great for a survival situation because even if they run out of butane they still are a great spark generator in a fairly compact design the only thing I don't like about them is that they won't fit in a candy tin like Altoids tin or this slightly different brand going this way you can put them in this way but you can store so much more if you can fit them in this way their competitor made by scripto will fit in a candy tin going this way it's about the only thing I like about it though the BIC I think is better in all other regards the first modification I did to it was I took a Leatherman can opener tip and I bore out the one of the little air intake nostrils and by doing that I was able to make a hole to be able to mount a split ring so that I can carry this on my survival keychain some people are going to wonder well won't that get hot and burn you not really I find that I can hold on to it for a good 10 to 15 seconds and it doesn't really get hot no more so than the metal at the top of the BIC anyway so if that doesn't seem to be an issue at least not in my use that this was my first mod that i just did simply by boring out one of the nostril holes you my next mod after that was to take a drill and to drill two holes one in each nostril and that way you can mount the split ring the other way that's what we have here on this BIC which I've also wrapped with a cash a supply of Gorilla Tape uh I don't know why it's an awfully nifty coincidence but duct tape is exactly the diameter of these mini Bix so you don't really even have to modify the duct tape or in this case gorilla tape and this holds a 1 foot supply so it wraps around a few times depending on how fat you're willing to make it you of course could carry more but I wanted just a small amount so this is a way to carry it on your keychain in my case my survival keychain and have it act as a duct tape supply or Gorilla Tape my final mark was to apply this same split ring to the top of a white pick the white bit Connect is a light diffuser for either the flash of a camera or a flashlight and I've added some red vinyl tape also as a store for electrical tape if you need it for something but also the red the white light going through the red turns the flashlight into red illumination which is good for night-vision preservation here's a demonstration of that this is a demonstration of my white pick lighter which has three modifications on it it has red vinyl taped to give it red illumination when you use it as a light diffuser it has a keychain attachment just a split ring through two holes that I've drilled through the top to be able to attach this to a keychain and it has a black nylon wire cable wrap which acts as a lock so the lighter won't accidentally waste any butane if something presses here you have to cut it off or pull it off in order to use the lighter but I don't smoke so lighter use is pretty rare for me this is really for a survival situation I also like that you can see the fluid so you have a good idea of exactly how much butane is left notice the illumination of the three dark areas here the the knife the flashlight and the the pen this is under low room lighting this is with no room illumination at all this is with my Ameritech flashlight aimed right at the center this is with the white diffuser which is the mini bic lighter held in front of the flashlight much easier to see what's going on in a broad view now I apply the red area this is good for night vision preservation so that you can see what's going on in low-light without ruining your night vision so once again red night vision mode weight diffuser mode flashlight used all by itself and no illumination all you can see is the glow-in-the-dark tape on my glow fob and a little bit that's also been applied to the other flashlight here's a close-up view of the nylon wire zip tie going around the BIC that's not my own idea the other mods are but this one I got from the web other people talked about it you can use it in conjunction with or without the a split ring keychain mount mod with it in place it's impossible to push down the lever you can still use the BIC as a spark generator but it won't light because you can't push down the butane dispensing mechanism you you", "dL2XNR-NNfg": "okay so have you ever wanted to know which lighter will last longer a disposable bic lighter or a refillable Zippo well then stay tuned okay guys so I just got done filming bic lighter vs. Zippo now the big lighter a lot of people don't like it the main disadvantages are this is not an airtight seal nothing about this is airtight which means the butane or the lighter fluid I believe is it's this stuff here on a full tank this runs for 21 minutes now in the video I just left the wick as is I know there's ways to get in there and clip it down or push it down there's ways to pull it up you know I left it as is um so you're talking about a big flame some people might complain that the test wasn't fair and all that stuff um it's - out of the box reviews okay so it's a brand new bic lighter and it's um this a lighter unit here is actually brand new it's phone bone-dry I believe at least it died um 21 minutes though so before I released the runtime of the pic lighter just think about that 21 minutes yeah you can see oh wait a minute crap I'm gonna have to go back going after you do that test no I'm just kidding um it died that was just some that was just luck of the draw just happened light but 21 minutes let me light that light this start the timer and then get a better hold on this so we are at the 10-minute mark and the BIC did not run out but I'm kind of concerned about this Zippo here yeah let me start that let me start that and we will resume okay you can see that we are at exactly 20 minutes and it's funny at the 10 minute mark this happened with the Zippo it the fuel third coming up around here and it made a ring a fire plus in the center so I blew it out let them both cool off and again almost exactly at the 10-minute mark or actually a little bit before from when I started again because we're at 20 now so at about the nine and a half minute mark that same exact thing happen again like right the very exact second okay so we are back let's see how did I do this last time I believe I started that one started that one and start started the timer so as you can see on camera are the the Zippo is the Zippo is still going still going still going it does it doesn't look lit but there's a small blue flame and let's get to 21 come on 21 10 more seconds 10 more 5 more and 21 whoo it's still going should I blow it out or should I let it die out it's very low okay it just died right at 20 21 33 it died you so after 50 minutes of runtime the big lighter beat my a TD my a TD start is set in I'm like ma'am how much longer is this going to last so I quit yes I quit after 50 minutes um 15 minutes and 33 seconds it still lights when you shake it there's a very small amount of fuel but it's still like 50 minutes guys 50 minutes of constant use now put that into context say use this for 6 seconds to start a fire 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 seconds in 1 minute that's 10 lights right 10 fires if you're this expert guy that can start a fire with fairy rod or bulge or whatever so in one minute so in one minute use you can start 10 fires I believe this will run for 60 minutes I ran it for 50 minutes and it still has some fuel I think it could run for another 10 minutes um okay 50 50 60 minutes if you use this for 6 seconds in one minute you can start 10 fires in 60 minutes you can start 600 fires maybe for some of you guys that watch that video and I'm colorblind but this pick lighter out on a degree in hunter green I I'm not sure it looks a hunter green it's dark and it has this label right here so in the beginning of this video I said this was a brand new lighter and it was but before I ran my runtime test this is the same lighter that I had soaking for 10 minutes in a cup of water yesterday I let it dry out overnight and then I and I did you know in that video I did flick it a couple times but so it was Road it wasn't like 99% new before I started this test and it ran for 50 minutes and there's still fuel in it now some people will say well every time you flick it it wears down the Flint and that's a valid point but I mean it's kind of like how many licks to get to the center of a sucker type thing a lollipop if I'm not going to sit here where are my thumbs and do this for five hundred times six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen ships okay I was trying to count I I just flicked this like 150 times backed back and probably count up another 50 times I have within the past couple days doing both the tests okay it's running on fumes literally the the roller bar is not worn out and it even has that very safe safety thing so all in all I want to dispel the whole myth about feral rods being the most reliable fire they're one way of starting fires matches are one way Vic lighters and Zippo lighters are one way they all have pros and cons but whenever I hear anybody say well always pack a Ferro rod in your survival kit or any time I don't ever go into the woods without a Ferro rod and all that stuff they think they're packing a useful survival tool what they're really packing is false confidence so all these internet bushcraft II people out there they're like well um you can start a fire in any condition with fur habla because oh have you done that before no it's because I saw Dave Canterbury do it this want to piss a lot of people out I would feel more confident carrying this into the woods and then if error on um they're both like carrying both carry two lighters carry two whatever but all these people are under this false illusion because a YouTube the internet Knollys like fanboy type forums stuff like that that these fair odds are just this magic gift from God that you can start a million fires they never run out no it's a disposable tool just like a lighter here I might roll in some pictures but I've broken fair odds before they were smaller diameter but they're not they break and can you still use it yeah you're working with like a one-inch nub so you can use it it's not that effective I don't even know how I'm going to edit this video out but you like this video make sure to leave a big thumbs up you know if you have comments you know please try and be respectful of all that stuff if you know you're just speaking up your ass and all that stuff I'll probably remove your comments and you'll get a laugh you know but I'll have the last laugh um feel free to give this video a thumbs down if you think what I did stupid and if you did learn anything from this video if you haven't already subscribed to my channel for more gear testing and videos like such", "qFk8zGRFMGQ": "okay guys I'm back I'm coming on today because I ran across some lighters and this group on the girl had posted some lighters that she was doing in the group song by with them you know I want to do that too so I was trying to figure out like what to do so I just grabbed some quick off internet that you know put on there so um I'll show y'all the steps idea it's so many different ones I don't watch the day on TV oh no you know YouTube or whatever I'm gonna do two different steps cuz I haven't tried the other way yet but uh what you need is some printable vinyl buddy set up Michaels either Hobby Lobby I don't know one more carrier than that but I think a lot of places are stopping it and I blab they got some by paper studio I haven't tried it yet but I have bought some I know this is good but it's almost the same texture and everything which is a printable vinyl and it's cheaper and you use the 40% off coupon if you go to Hobby Lobby it's called paper studios it should be over there with a cookie stuff it and you can use a 40% off on that but on Cricut brand you cannot so if you use a regular piece of paper also I'm gonna do the regular piece of paper at the end I'm gonna do the vinyl myth so already print my images on my choice and this was printed on the Cricut paper and I did my regular paper to and I were to cut it on MUP or whatever and try to see what they fit cuz paper is different I don't know so we're gonna do that nine you need a lighter a question no you need some scissors the measurements are so freakin tricky out I just kept playing with that that's why I printed the paper first I kept playing with it and then you want to print it a little longer like uh on this one here if you notice I just put a block behind and attached a picture just you know kids had to go a little longer it won't look so playing I don't want it to look like regular piece of paper so when you do it you don't want to scratch a picture either cuz you want your picture to stay like pretty so if you scratch its gonna go away so don't scratch a picture try to put a shape behind and change the box shape and everything that kind of match and if you need a step on that I try to do that for you but for the ones that do know how to attach and flatten to print and cut that's pretty much all I did I just add a box and I change the color of it and I attach my picture to it not flatten it for I'll look and print together okay so all these I guess it is a regular piece of paper I didn't mean to you know night I didn't know some simple finally amateur your choice it's just that stuff y'all I like them they look so cute I messed this one up now another thing when you lay that vinyl down make sure you lay this point late like I show you because I was I messed up trying to get that little part off and they wrinkled up a little bit so vinyl is like vinyl it's gonna stick once the sticky stuff kind of want to make it shiny too so this method here I seen on the internet and I don't have no real clear clear plastic tape she said use them I don't even know if I got enough on it but use the clear tape for the paper in order to get it but to me that's like quick and cheap so if you just want one for yourself I wouldn't try to sell it to a customer but I don't know how it's gonna hold up because I can't find it down okay I don't know how it's gonna hold up so don't quote me on telling you how to sell this I'm just doing it cuz I thought it was a cool idea so this is some tape in that it's not even to me big enough she the girl in the video I watched earlier look like she had like a wider tape too so this right here already looked like trash to me so I wanna do my cooking report and don't get your fingerprints on because that's gonna make it showing off look trashy yeah so this is for people who ain't got no printable vinyl and just want to get your measurements right I will print this with the tape in the paper first and you know before you waste your vinyl and then I'm try to go you just you know which I see now I didn't have enough measurements right but that's all that is is wrapping it around there let's see if you look closely I don't mean like I should have cut my tape first so cut your tape I just went to wrapping stuff girl I don't know why cut the tape I would leave some hanging out on the edges because you don't know how you wrap it but I don't want to waste my lighter with this one but you just want to make sure you have it even see look at that it's not enough you want all that to cover you wanna start it by right there snan you wrap so you know it's too long so I got that tape right there so if you don't tape your wrap until you feel comfortable anything this is what a little light wood tables don't look super bad I just feel like as I'm nosy I could've did better but my repres kills with dishes like trash but you get the message I was trying to see which it won't be bad but you know people be so picky so with the with the printable vinyl I want to do a blow dryer to try to get the sticker off y'all but I was scared to put to my teeth against this ladder I don't know if we're gonna blow up and then you know I'm gonna take no chance doing it and I'm in like if some of y'all ain't scared do it on your own but I prefer yeah I didn't feel like a rope no oil on it so you can get some oil rubbed on but then I miss a sticker up to me I was just scraping it's gonna be covered up anyway so just remove the back another sticker I think I got a crafting problem y'all I see one idea every day and I want to do it like I can't stick to one thing though I suppose doing air fresheners but it's just like I don't know quick on my labels and packaging and this was a cool idea right who says you got to do one thing at a damn time anything so we got them I think I'm a peak of this picture here I kind of cut her to it I mean like I don't know and I got a steady hand sometimes I do bit I really don't I got this cutter here I wonder if I use it when it'd be like too much going on if I need some extra anytime got to do it in yeah they cut it good enough me in who I know they gonna be perfect I just wanted to be not hanging overnight oh yeah okay so that is too short still short yeah so I should have made them a couple more inches longer okay guys I had to come back I had to reprint sir sizes anyway I'm I think I'm printer run out of eat so my look like this now but I did get the ones I did more I got two ghouls so let me use those I'm still gonna use those and probably use them I don't know these are cute they different so I might still use that I probably used a with your things come in let me know should I use those anywho what I saw mr. song said that messed up you know I got the sublimation front we got sublimate oh look - let me try that this is this is a little paper I got from Walmart you got this little blue thing right here it says print me but it says inkjet printer glitter card stock if you go to Walmart is like five dollars so I'm gonna my piece of paper on there you know heat up over there I see them apart I don't think it's hot enough yet because I just walked in the house to 69 the dead heat now I come back to that better I ain't even got no time on it's real but I noticed it when I do heat it too long it does burn the glitter it'll be like brown instead of clear I let it go for a little bit okay so this is the one I was doing see now this me now this one's too long to cut I don't want to pay that late yeah they want it more like the money sure my measurements let me show y'all that right quick time it's just I don't know see if you got the cricket match I always measure it from the two blocks so it's like almost like two and a half inches across then it's like two and a half down when I did the measurements I think it was like two seats this is six or so my dad 265 I don't know it's a  inning I did the half a person maybe I did something wrong I did I don't have the first one I did and you see how short that was so I would just go over a little just peel the back now this and well that might come out like a got 3d his idea put a paper up I should have taped it down but that's just me I haven't noticed I don't do I supposed to do so when I say you're seeing eyes on that in I put it in make sure you get even I want it by my is up there like what a money shot and it's where you wanted that before you wrap it make sure it's like it's supposed to be like right there you know you want it like just make sure that's where you wanted it before you wrap it around some girl said wrap it up a blunt I'm not for me you will blend so yeah scene I'm eyes is cricket because I think that it even I wanted even before I get too stuck like hey it is what it is pinky cheese extra knife or something to go around it and cut the little excess oh that was good right and then I was thinking maybe we do like us my approach highlight that better what about you my bacon look like trash but hey it's pretty they paying that much damn attention till neither do any day is key but you know you can work on perfecting like I said I'm just practicing right now anyway and think skin put some heat on it cuz you know I love my healing but I'd be trying to stick inside the heating boy once you have them into your hair yeah I really want to try to blow dryer take me and just to see can I get the sticker to come up even in the end that way I can put the sticker here but I'm gonna do another design so I'm gonna take a picture of with the lighter thing but I'll go either Google one and then I will attach it to the picture that way when I wrap it and be on the bag happy with your thing by that I think that'll be cool so I think I'm gonna do that it's probably the longest video y'all ever seen appreciate ones that are watching hey man yo stop playing with me like company and subscribe to my channel I don't do this for fun I do it for fun but I do it for the lights also I like this fire people I like helping people but if I'm helping you are you learning anything I'm just taking a run yeah like it comment subscribe gotta touch the hand or even hand so I guess y'all wondering like I'm wondering how am I gonna get this car a piece of paper like you know fold and all that good stuff well let's see I thought about doing a tape MIT take me the paper so pretty I won't mess it up so I gotta get this super super super super tight okay some oh this looks dear Trevor funny no don't forget a shine that's hard with the on the glitter on it but the tape I'm in gonna try 110 cuz I got so many if I come up with something that's different I let y'all know what another video come up I don't think I would I would do that like this for sale though or uh got a laminating machine and I got some other permanent running tape or mounting tape now on tape I have you see that might work with so the dog free tape you don't want that you won't get the real stuff I just don't like you sister's wedding first of all here organize yeah various trash I'll try to pull it is tight tight tight tight tight tight as possible I did girls say like you rolling something which I would not know that about you pull that on a while yeah they look like trash to me do they I mean it's holding it but it's just still look like trash to me because I'm in my just this is car stuff you would need something very very very very starting to me to make it just like wait yeah don't do this this trash day if we just wanted to decorate your old lighter you know I would prefer it Dan but I think it can be perfected it just this is so cheap table and I was rushing as usual but just icky and I didn't know what it would have looked like it does look better with a glitter see that right there go bad but it's not tight enough to me you need to be laying all the way down good job Josephine good job wanna magic so y'all make sure y'all like coming and subscribe to the girl chairman let me know how I did yes sir and I'm back with another video tomorrow maybe love you", "OiLvCQEMFbg": "why choose one torch over the other it's very much like why choose a car versus a truck they're both good for different things where if you look at a single torch it is going to be more precision heating in specific locations on the tip if you're looking at getting higher temperatures to get more dense vapor you're going to want to heat at the base of the tip or you can focus on the actual end of the cap for more flavor or you can use a triple torch if you're looking for quick even heating a lot easier to use less prone to error and it's going to heat up really quickly give you a nice quick heat up time and it'll be a lot easier for new users to experience our product now if you are going to use a single torch I do recommend being a little bit more familiar with the product because it is precision if you hold the heat in too long on a specific area the tip it may lead to combustion so you do want to be careful and so that's going to be the main differences between the tips if you're going to be doing looking for that blowing clouds look for a single torch if you're gonna be on the go

onto a video on this bic lighter here I have a lot of people send messages and asking about it and talking about a little bit when I did my EDC update just because they're interested in the cigar band that was on there so there's a really cool way to kind of decorate or enhance the looks of your BIC anyone who buys big lighters know that there is probably hundreds if not thousands of different designs so they have on Bix which is pretty cool everything from like a thumbs up to a preface to words slogans I had one a had a pickle on it on the front and it's just to represent people's different styles you know I mean you so you get something that fits your style or of course the classic big letters which are just solid colors but there's a cool way especially I mean most obviously for cigar smokers is to be a cool little addition especially if you're using the BIC to light your cigars it's a little pizazz definitely something to talk about but the big question people had was hey what ring size fits a bit lighter which I should have mentioned in the first time first video when I was talking a little bit but essentially it is a 50 ring gauge that fits perfectly snug onto a big lighter but there's a caveat they're not all 50 ring gauge cigar will work ok so first off I started with this Rocky Patel which was absolutely perfect ok slipped on it was nice and snug it's very hard to move so it's not going to it's not going to go anywhere then after that one I put on this San Miguel because I had a cool little design which I probably take off just because it leaves a gap because it's not you know even all the way around it's not a huge deal or anything but I like the way this looks on the front here but you could see that the San Miguel although also a 50 ring gauge is looser on this lighter than the Rocky Patel and then most recently actually this morning I had smoked a Arturo for one day it was a short story Hemingway and Maduro which I believe is technically a four by forty nine so it's a forty nine ring gauge but the problem with that cigar is that it tapers quite a bit it's very unique shape so like you know the bottom here towards you know where you would be smoking it or the end you're putting in your mouth basically is a little bit smaller so this is perfect but the bottom you know it flares out a little bit not because the paper flares out but because because the cigar is tapered and the label or the band is totally straight when they wrap together it's just you know it's a little bit slanted so you can see that slant right there and you can see that I just kind of pinch this over and fold it down so if you love a tighter alright so when using the slider these aren't gonna fall off or anything you know I mean but they do slide a little bit so I'm gonna take this off alright to give you another example though this is a cigar band from a Gurkha ninja okay a knife size which I believe is a regular reboost oh it's five by fifty and even though this is a fifty ring gauge this is a little bit too big for this this later so you can see actually it's easier for a star from the top here alright as I slide this over you can see it's big enough has enough slack in it to go completely over the lighter doesn't get caught up on this other one mmm actually starting to lift up a little bit here yeah anyway you guys get the idea it's too big to be tight on the the lighter here okay so that's not going to work now even though it's a fifty ring gauge that fits the lighter not all cigar bands are going to be exactly the same in that when they you know fold this over and it gets glued maybe one's a little bit tighter than the other you know there's very minut differences so you know I'm using fifty ring gauge as a reference to about what's going to fit but doesn't mean all fifty ring ages ago fit like this one's a little bit too loose now when I smoke a cigar what I generally try to do it does it's not always possible because sometimes the glue that they use if it's not self-adhesive the glue might stick a little bit to the actual cigar leaf or the wrapper and of course in that point you don't want to be tugging on any things and you'll just ruin the cigar but uh often times I'm able to slip the cigar band off the cigar before I'm done smoking it okay especially once it starts getting closer to that area generally speaking that the cigar will heat up a little bit would be a little bit warm and a little bit squishier so you can maneuver that ring off without damaging the wrapper so most of my cigar bands they have in this case you could see a tiny bit of wrapper actually stuck to it but I'm still able to you know finish the cigar just fine so these rappers are still glued together totally unnecessary it's just something I happen to do but obviously if it's unglued you can use a larger size ring gauge so if you have anything from a 50 ring gauge up you can just you know wrap it around and drop a new piece of glue on there or you can actually glue it to the lighter I see my cigar band so when I'm done with this later instead of fluid I'll just slip these off and put it back in my little collection I saved every single cigar band from every cigar I've ever smoked in my entire life okay why I don't know because I'm weird like that I have you know you know my hobbies into my collector that's in me you know I mean it's deeply rooted in my personality to collecting things and it's cool to be able to back and see literally every cigar I've ever smoked in my life so um yeah it's interesting well I say cigar I should say premium cigar because as a kid there were plenty of like white owls and you know tiparillo that I've smoked occasionally but anyway and you say any cigars actually had a band on it I've saved so yeah just a cool little idea but like I said it doesn't have to be a fifty that just happens if it perfectly any cigar band that's a size 50 or above will work fine just wrap it around obviously glue it so it's nice and tight and if you want to have it permanently on the lighter then just put a little bit of glue obviously around the actual band itself so when you slip it on or wrapped it around it would glue itself to the lighter and be more of a permanent fixture but uh definitely add something as a little character to your big lighters okay okay let's say you don't smoke cigars but you like this idea because a lot of different cigar bands are very decorative all you have to do is know a smoker okay unfortunately I don't think you can go into a smoke shop and ask for bands because no one really saves them in that respect however who knows you know you never know right so let's say you don't smoke cigars but you do like this and you don't know anyone who does smoke cigars that will save the bans again to you it's a shot the dark but you can of course you know go into any smoke shop and ask say hey you know if you guys are thrown out bands can you save it for me I'll you know I'll pick them up and maybe they will do that because a lot of times more times are not a smoke shop will also have a smoking lounge whether it's one table or a whole back room they usually have a smoking lounge and people are smoking cigars there they're done they just leave their nubs in the ashtray so anyway if you get a really nice guy at the cigar shop maybe when he goes to throw out those nubs and empty the ashtrays he'll slip off the band's for it you know you just never know so it's worth asking I guess but anyway there you go so see you guys later thanks again for watching hope you guys have a great day and I'll talk to you soon take care", "h-7GWVJCHqs": "[Music] check check check check check what's going on YouTube so we're back in the oume studio about to do a really cool project for you guys it's no secret I like to do a lot of projects involving lighters of the disposable kind there is that one after a while these ordinary lighters kind of a boring so today we're gonna hack this make it more modern by doing what I've done too many things before as cramming a laser inside of a cheap disposable lighter now I've done this with a Zippo lighter in the past that was really small I was kind of a challenge to fit all the components inside of that tiny shell I don't know I think this is a little bit bigger so hopefully it should be a little bit easier actually what am I saying guys I already made it it's right here I'm filming this intro at the end of the video check this out guys just kidding you gotta watch the video so yeah this projects pretty simple to make I'll leave a link still lasers down in description I don't think they're not they're not very expensive at all I've probably paid like fifteen dollars for this now shipping does take a while probably buy more expensive one and the shipping won't be this bad but yeah the plan is to rip apart a laser and stick it inside a lighter I think Kip cater the video very similar to this back in the day the og DIY people know what I'm talking about I want to try it for myself and plus I'm gonna add a rechargeable battery to it so it's not a disposable thing we can actually recharge and reuse it so that's the plan let's do it [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so little update guys I've emptied the fuel out of these two lighters one of which is the BIC and the other one is like the off-brand I'm not really sure which one's going to be the best housing we're gonna hollow these out and figure out how to cram this 100 milliwatts laser into these lighters let's do it [Music] [Applause] so it's able to remove the laser diode from this laser right here well this is actually a different one this is what's left of the original laser but yeah we got out the laser diode one other thing I did was the tape on the focusing piece right here because without it the beams just super dispersion it's like a flashlight and it's not gonna be able to burn anything I'm actually accidentally it's connected to one of the leads so I had the restart of that so that's why it looks a little bit messed up but it still works and now we have to figure out a way to cram it inside of this later right here anything think think about fit we'll make it work the original battery that came with was uh this ultrafire things are like these are pretty much the standard like cheap Chinese batteries I think it's what like 3.7 volts 0.2 a half hour battery a little bit too big to fit inside the light so I'm gonna probably step it down maybe use a couple of button cells or potentially a few of these I think this is a 12-volt battery I'm assuming it's a lot lower amps so I might have to use a couple of these try and see how many of these we can fit inside of this lighter huh that should be enough to power this laser here [Music] so I'm actually gonna try using this 3.7 volts lithium-ion battery instead because I think it's the perfect size to fit right in the bottom part of the lighter plus I think it put out more amps than the original batteries thinking of using [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] alright guys so here is our finished modified laser lighter as you can see we've got the laser diode packed down in there and in the bottom we've got the three point seven volt lithium ion battery along with actually two prongs which is what we're going to use to charge this battery I made a little charging circuit as well so one of them cause one of the negative we just plug that in their natural charge the battery so up here we have the push-button switch to activate the laser if I shine at the camera it won't really do anything because it's at a far enough distance where the light is just so dispersed like I can shine it on my hand from this distance away as you can see it's just like just literally like a circle what if we bring it in closer about like I think one inch away I'll just show you on some electrical tape the beam goes from this like wide circle focuses down and then it'll start burning right about there which is exactly what we want like we don't want this to be like dangerous from a distance like if you accidentally like you're lighting something your hand and it hits you in the eye like don't want it to be super focused and burn from a distance so that's good that actually like unfocus is like it's literally just like a flashlight from this distance like it's really not gonna hurt you very much at all if it hits you um but that being said you don't want to get super close and get hit by this because obviously it will burn you there so yeah pretty simple build actually all I had to do is rip apart a laser I'll leave some links to uh lasers down in the description below standard bic later you don't really want to use the cheap ones for these builds I usually use a lot of cheap ones but for this billboard kind of want the higher quality ones because they're a little bit bigger more sturdy and probably not gonna crack the plastic as much so yeah that's pretty much all there is to it laser module laser diode in here battery charger oh yeah one other thing you can do is screw this focusing thing in and out more you can adjust the burn distance so right now obviously as I said I have it like really close so it works just like a normal lighter it's like you hold it up really close to the thing and it uh they'll burn just like that times it's so cool guys like I love like I love modding like simple things later and turning them to really high-tech gadgets like this very cool right up my alley you can see doesn't doesn't really harm the camera at all that's pretty much how this works so what do you say we go test this on some stuff see what it can do [Music] [Music] all right guys I'm gonna selfie this outro alright guys thank you very much for watching that is the video I made a really cool little tiny laser later right here pretty simple bill probably took me a couple hours to figure this out leave a like if you did enjoy this video and of course hit that subscribe button if you're not already and uh oh yeah comment your ideas below of cool stuff you want to see me make next I'll read some out from my previous video first up I have any comments make uh stereotypes with your twin yeah probably Steve Drake's down for that nice nice see what I can do and then the video I did before that anonymous guy comments nothing gets you in the Christmas spirit like watching a kid named Jake laser massacre a snowman with a bullet of ice they are true mayor Christmas home and you guys comment down below what do you want me here I don't know some funny jokes love reading them that's pretty much all for this video guys happy holidays and we will catch you in the next one pugs [Music] [Music] [Music]", "St6NEhm-xps": "what's up guys hope you're having a good Sunday I had an interesting conversation with a friend this past week about preference and lighters as Americans we've primarily grown up with these big style lighters they come in thousands of different designs thousand flicks with your BIC one time use disposable and throw them away I pretty much used this lighter my entire life but there's also a lighter that's out there on the market that's more popular in Europe and many people say that this is the far superior lighter that's on the market today and this is what's known as a clipper lighter again this is more of a popular style that's available in Europe I believe these are made in Spain very similar to the scale say this is more like a size of a tuba lipstick I guess you could say a little bit smaller than that of the BIC but this is also made of a nylon polymer material that catches on fire at a much higher degree of temperature and on the bottom here it has a rounded shape and that's about the size of a bowl so for you pipe smokers out there you can actually use this as a tamper as you smoke and here in the center this is also refillable with butane so this is a more eco-friendly lighter as opposed to the BIC which is just a one-time use you can actually just get a can of butane to the store for like two to three dollars and refill this dozens of times and use less plastic also the shape it is rounded and it has a flat edge to it so you could actually use this as a scraper so when you're scraping up your flour on your tray or whatever it comes in handy for that reason up here is the Flint system and if you just take your two fingers and pinch and pull straight out this comes completely out and the way this Flint system works is that right here this screw just screws completely often there's a spring inside of here and your Flint is right here next to the wheel the striking wheel now this is also designed to where it can hold two pieces of Flint unlike one piece like the big so this is actually if you add an extra piece it could be a longer-lasting lighter in that regard as I was researching this lighter I saw on some YouTube Survival pages that they were also using this mechanism to start fires with if you have some nice fluffy material you can use the sparks and use this as a way to start a fire pretty interesting but as the cannabis industry they've looked at this and noticed how long this tool is so they have started to use this as a packing tool when you're packing pre-rolls and cones in the such you can use this to pack and tuck in the end of your joint with this little tiny tool you can also peel off this little cut in this case covering right here and this also serves as a crutch so that way like whenever you're rolling joints per se you can just put your paper down in there like so and use it as a crutch while you hold your joint pretty interesting but yeah the assembly is very simple this just slides right back in there and get this back on snaps right back on and the other key feature about this is that whenever you hold the flame of this lighter when you turn it over to its side or if you hold it upside down there's more butane that is released by this lighter that produces a bigger flame so just like so now watch it as I turn it over you can also hear more butane being expelled so it's a huge flame now this is awesome for pipe smokers or if you're out in the wind or whatnot this is an awesome feature that just blasts that flame out there so if you're trying to catch the you know just even if starting a fire this is a huge benefit to this lighter however as a cannabis connoisseur I like to be able to control the size of that flame and that's what this doesn't have I saw in some YouTube videos that you can actually remove everything and there's some adjustments that you can make to control the size of this flame but as far as like with the big style and the knockoff style lighters as far as like a lighter adjustment valve this simply just doesn't have that so if you don't want to torch your bowl when you turn it over it's best to hold the the lighter a little bit further away so that way the flame just kind of licks the book you know look to the top of your bowl instead of just turning it over and just torching it with the flame you can I like the back better for that reason because you can control how small that is and that way you don't burn up all your green hid Dobby torching bowls and passing it to your friends it's 20 20 hopefully that's something that's done in the past but don't be that smoker and torch the green bowls but those are just a few of the key features that people feel why this clipper lighter is the superior lighter next time you see one of these now that you know the features maybe can play around with it and determine for yourself if you think the clipper might be the better lighter than that of the Bick thanks for watching guys", "7vo_sNC1Evw": "hey what's going on guys I've made videos showing how to open bottles with all kinds of stuff and I think the most common thing you can use or see people use is a bit lighter so I'm going to show you really quick once again how to open a beer bottle with just a Bic lighter having this kind of semi soft plastic here really grips a lot better and that's what kind of hangs on to the other ridges of the cap and it allows you to lift it off so you can see this will chew up your lighter after a while but it's not a big deal because this probably be empty and useless to you before it actually breaks by doing this so basically all I want to do is grab the neck of the bottle okay you want to put the the lighter underneath and in basically between your first and second knuckle okay so it's a nice flat area but you want to make sure you do when people do wrong when they try this is that it's not deep enough what you want is the plastic to be underneath the sharp ridges okay of the cap okay so it has to basically bite down into the plastic when you're doing this alright so if you do this put it down in between the first and second knuckle make sure that it's underneath that cap and basically you want to squeeze pretty hard with this off hand alright if you have a light grip it's gonna slip off and it's not going to work but if you squeeze really hard and it's underneath there all you're doing is pushing down okay on this lighter and it's got to fly off so let me give a better view of this alright because we do this right these things will fly across the room alright so nice good grip there you go really easy to do as an off note or side note Sam Adams hope you guys have an awesome day thanks for watching and I'll see you soon take care", "5953T8fq8IM": "all of these butane torches were returned by customers because they believe they did not work the fact is there's nothing wrong with any of these torches they all work perfectly a butane torch is easy to operate but sometimes a novice can become confused and think a torch is malfunctioning when it's not one of the most common mistakes people make is choosing the wrong type of butane when the wrong butane is used the torch can clog and sputter look for butane that is designed for torches this is Blaser butane it's special because it's tripple refined if it doesn't say tripple refined on the can it's not the right stuff here's a can of the wrong type of butane the label says it's premium but that's not the same as tripple refined nowhere on this can does it say triple refined the nipple can also be a problem each brand has its own style of nipple this one is plastic Blaser butane includes a set of nipple adaptors to accommodate a variety of nipple sizes you'll lose a lot of gas when filling if the nipple does not fit properly another common mistake is thinking the torch is filled when it's not to fill a torch turn it upside down and insert the nipple into the fill tube press down and hold until the butane fits you'll hear the air in the tank expelling as the gas filled you'll also feel the tank getting cold the tank is not filled until it spits it's also important to let the gas equalize after filling set the torch aside for three to five minutes before lighting if you ever need to empty a torch which you should do before traveling our mini pallet knife works great use the tip of the knife to press the fill tube and hold it down while the gas releases you'll be able to hear the gas escaping let it rest a few seconds and then repeat it takes a lot longer to empty a torch than it does to fill it so you may have to repeat this several times before it's totally empty to be sure try to light the torch if it doesn't light it's empty all of our butane torches feature a safety switch like this micro torch to light slide the safety switch down then press the igniter button and then press the flame lock to keep it lit there's an oxygen adjustment on the top less oxygen gives a softer cooler flame more oxygen gives a sharper hotter flame on the right side of the torch there's a gas adjustment slide it forward for more gas and back for less to turn the torch off press the igniter button the micro torch is easy to work with one hand to light the spitfire torch roll the safety switch up then press down on the igniter and then slide the flame lock in place the spitfire oxygen adjustment is on the top less oxygen gives a cooler softer flame and more oxygen gives a sharper hotter flame the gas adjustment is on the right if you roll it back all the way it'll shut off the proper way to turn off the spitfire is to use the flame lock switch this is the metal clay firing torch to light pull down on the safety switch then press the igniter and lock the flame on the flame can be adjusted with the gas adjustment on the right this big flame is perfect for torch firing metal clay there's an oxygen adjustment on this model but it's not all that useful it's clumsy to use and it can get very hot quickly so I never use it to turn this torch off just slide the lock switch forward this is the jumbo-sized metal clay firing torch it holds more gas so the flame lasts much longer than the other models and it operates exactly the same as the smaller versions many of our torches have a removable base for ease of use the base is only for storage when not in use never leave a lit torch in the stand it should always be held in

today I'm coming at you with an interesting video for you today I want to talk about the two most common lighters that you can purchase just about anywhere the first one is the script oh and the second one is the BIC classic now these are both both very good lighters too both very easily accessible easy to find they're both non refillable they're both disposables but in this video what I want to do is I want to show you why I prefer the BIC over any other lighter and the scripto would be a close second but why I like the BIC so my objective of the video today is I'm gonna take them apart and must show you exactly why I like the BIC okay before I get started I want to make sure that you understand that I do not get any kind of kickback I don't get any money I don't get any sponsorship or anything like that from big or script or anybody this video everything that I'm talking about is strictly my opinion and I'm just here to share that with you so there's no shenanigans I'm not hooked up with any of these guys or nothing like that so let me start by taking this script oh and I'm gonna take these little needlenose and I'm gonna bend this little piece of metal here I'm gonna remove this this cap thing off okay I'm keeping my thumb pressed down because this will I don't want this will to fly away so I'm just kind of removing this piece of metal sorry if I got out of camera there for you so I'm removing the will excuse me I'm removing the metal housing setting that down these both are dead okay they don't have any fuel like left in them okay same with the BIC they're both dead now I'm gonna do the same thing with the BIC I'm gonna remove the little metal housing here can I set those two down now let's just take a look at the metal housing alone if you look at them you'll notice that the bic lighter the one on the left the metal housing is much thicker that's the first thing I noticed if I turn on my digital scale here and I take the metal housing from the script oh you can see that my scale is zeroed I put that on the scale it weighs 25 grains the one from the BIC 26.1 so there's a little bit more metal involved in the BIC it's a little bit heavier just slightly now what I'm going to do is I'm gonna slowly I'm gonna look at the lighter and you can see that the button that I push that controls the gas lifts this little thing here the this linkage I guess you could call it is plastic you see that then I'm scraping it right there that's plastic underneath on this script oh it's a plastic piece that could break okay it's not even connected over here it's like they snap it around this piece I think the piece underneath it's brass or something that's the piece that the actual fuel comes out of see that it's brass but this part is all plastic if you look at the BIC it's metal so you got a little a bigger beefier mechanism you see the metal underneath there it's all metal in it's metal that is got plastic around it so that's that's a big significant difference in my opinion you're dealing with metal parts yes you still have your piece of brass here you see where I scratched it that's all brass but to me that's a significant difference just in that one aspect alone again this is not near as beefy it's a lot easier for breakage this button on the BIC it seems a little easier to push to and I think that it does that is because the length of this button is longer and because of its length being a little bit longer see if I put the two buttons almost in line with each other you can see it's a little longer the fact that it's longer means that there's more leverage that's being applied to lift this up now does that matter probably not I just thought I'd point that out now I'm gonna hold my finger here and I'm just gonna pop this will off now be careful if you do this at home because there's a spring-loaded Flint underneath and I don't want to lose that Flint or that spring okay so you can see the Flint right here in my hand it fell out that's the actual Flint itself that's what's in the script oh and here's the will it's got these little outer wheels that go around it they come off let me set that down let's do the same thing with the BIC we're gonna remove this will again I'm being very careful because I don't want stuff to go flying everywhere there's the will of the picked it's a one-piece well and there's the Flint off the BIC now if you look at the Flint's just alone look at the difference here's the script oh right here on the right there's the BIC on the left not only is there more meat to the BIC Flint it's longer but it's also fatter in diameter let's weigh those and see what the difference is in weight on those so the first one on the scale is going to be the script oh 0.8 grains the BIC 1.9 more than double the weight so you get more than twice the amount of pharisee m-flint so again here's the bit cap here's the big Flint script Oh cap script will Flint now let's look at these wheels let's weigh the will of the script Oh thirty four point one the pick twenty six point five so the BIC is a little bit lighter the will now let's take a look further let's look at the actual spring that's involved with this lighter let's pull this baby out and see there's the spring that we're dealing with with the script Oh decent little spring I'll see nothing wrong with that nothing too significant let's look at the BIC there's the big spring there's the script Oh spring says it all right there folks quite a significance now the reason that I'm mentioning the spring and that there's more of it on the BIC because if we are in a survival situation and we have to pull resources out of this lighter say for example we need some wire maybe to make a compass or something like that or to tie us narrow or anything there's more wire on that BIC than there is on that script oh that's just the bottom line big difference let's weigh these starting with the script Oh whoops sorry about that folks 2.0 actually it bumped down to 1.9 3.5 so you got a significant difference in the weight of the springs now we're talking about the fuel vessel itself okay you know I mentioned earlier the the metal that's involved here versus the plastic now this scripto is an adjustable flame that's kind of cool the pic doesn't have that but let's take this another step further and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to tear into these fuel tanks and I'm gonna look inside okay we're gonna start with the scripto and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take this little grinder and it might get close to my fingers I don't want you guys to freak out look at this thing is very weak it's not that powerful it's a pretty easy grinder I know you guys kind of rag on me because I use this thing but it's not that big of a deal so I'm just gonna fire it up that's what we're dealing with there let's look at the bit okay let's look at the bottom half looks like the BIC has a little bit larger reservoir I will say that I liked the script Oh in the fact that the reservoirs are see-through you could see you know if you had a flashlight you could definitely look in there and see your fuel level on the BIC it's a little harder to do that see the difference there so on that aspect I liked the script Oh better you know the ability to see your fuel inside so I'm just kind of looking in here just playing around there's the width if you will of the script Oh some of the wick see it's a small chamber and that's plenty thick you can see that the plastic is plenty thick so it's not like they're giving you some weak skinny little fuel canister it's thick plastic there's the wick in there the pic does not have a wick the plastic is just as thick - divider in the middle is thicker on the script Oh which I don't think that really matters internally let's look at the upper half just kind of clean this up a little quick take a look and see what it looks like up here looking down inside can I see some metal parts inside on the right there I see like a piece of brass or metal let's check this one out so this one has a little wick that's kind of cool but apparently it's not necessary because Bick doesn't do it let's pull this wick thing off if we can on a wolf we can or not now let's look down inside and yeah we got a little bit of metal in there too but the major differences are these ones did I mentioned earlier look at the difference in the size of the spring and the in the the Flint Vic has such a much bigger Flint I mean if you yeah I I know this might sound funny but if you were in a survival situation and you had to rely on that Flint if all you had was you know you're out of fuel and all you had was the spark which this isn't a good example because this one has feel but if all you had was a spark look at the difference in the amount of sparks that you would get I mean it's pretty pretty simple to figure that out that she'd get a lot more sparks out of the Vic so that aspect alone makes me want to buy a Bick right there just in that because you know I don't know if you've seen my fire video where I took an old lighter that didn't work anymore and I showed you how to make a fire using that spark I had a cotton ball and it was an old beat-up bic lighter but that that wick or excuse me that Flint you know it gave me the ability to make that fire and there's other tricks that you can do with the Flint as well and I'll show you in another video in the future but anyway I want to say thank you guys for watching my video today on dissecting the Bick versus the scripto I hope you found some good useful information I hope that you guys share this video please like my video thumbs up on it if you don't mind feel free to comment feel free to subscribe and as always have a beautiful day we'll see you next time now get out there and get you a Bic lighter I think they're the best bye bye", "ehoeCf7voaM": "hey guys mark here for Santino cigars cocktail Santino Sundance Garvey I've got mark SOI her back with me say hi hello Steve Hodges the man this is this week's just a tip I'm getting ready to take off the Vegas small for the IPC PR so maybe a cigar guys y'all know what it is you know the biggest trade show of the year or blah blah blah we're gonna talk about traveling with cigars lighters and cutters all right every one of us here's traveled every one of us here is flown to multiple countries and lots of places and all over the states multiple countries multiple countries know so I mean first thing you guys you big travelers know well any but I have traveled there's a lot of chat there's a lot of misconceptions when it comes to traveling now especially with TSA regulations so we all know that we can't take a torch through TSA but they all like to say that you can take a soft flame through TSA now a Bic can always fly matches can always fly when it comes to anything fueled with butane you got a check in your luggage all right so when you fly what do you do with your cut area life well I check it you could I love my cutter and I go everywhere with it I take it easy I take it to Dubai I take that this this cutter goes with me everywhere and I'm not willing to leave it because I don't want to have to to be in a place where I have to rely on somebody else's I know that people have actually everybody's very particular about their style of cut some people like the beat cut some I've met people who who sliced it with a knife this is what I want and I make sure that I always have it and unfortunately I can't take down the plant as far as I know right haja when you travel what do you do with your son go ahead I can take everything but a butane now this one I've already traveling with a couple times it's got one cutter in the back with this the only thing like the butane is what you're talking about they'll they'll call me out there they will not let me take the view tank I've even tried to go like zero butane you like your cut it's nothing like that are you tain out of it I've tried to do it with all buting's like yeah so is that a Czech baggage or a carry on carry on yeah so but the cutter and the cigars this cigars can't cool but the butane lighters was whatever reason even I try to do it with no butane because I thought well we've got no butane in it maybe they'll let me slide but no go right so my check-in with TSA my understanding everything we do so any lighter whether it's a soft flame butane filled a full butane single towards triple torch quad torch you find a decade war it's good for you it's a lot of lot of flames if you check it in your baggage if it is checked it can fly now like Mark said when it comes to particular particular cuts and lights I don't like flying somewhere and I have to get a a cheap cutter a D Jeep lighter or you know a lot of times like matches are awesome I use matches a lot when I'm in the basement or where someone's house we're hanging out and there's no wind around matches don't work and win these scenarios and you can't use them and that's just seem to be able to go anywhere so the tip this week is simple if you're flying take your cigars take your cut out of your choice your lighter of your choice as long as it's not a butane torch so you're trying to you know burn the world down with you can take that check it in your baggage ziploc bag is preferable they can see it in a contained case that helps put it in your baggage check it don't carry anything on if you're flying Southwest your first-rate baggage up to 50 pounds is free shopping Southwest love Southwest take it check it fly with it for mark Steve and myself that's this week's Justin tip", "mZJxcYz5dJY": "hello YouTube what's up everyone moody's here and we Bri viously made a video testing a DJ blighter how long could it stay lighting up before it runs out of gas and today I had some spare time and post brand new clever and big lighters so let's put them on the same test and find out together how long they both could stay lighting up before they run out of gas I will start to ask clever and I will add 10 to 15 seconds for the big as a time delay [Music] there you go my friends here is results of that test as you can see post lighters are damaged to where they can't light up anymore and one thing my friends these lighters are never meant to be kept continuously lighting otherwise they could harm you or the code explode because of the high temperature so I do not recommend that you do any of this at home or test them to keep lighting continuously they are meant to light a cigarette or something but not to be kept running all the time and I even burn it my post sums several times when I touch it those very hot metal parts during the tests and considering I wasted some time between lighting both of them and one turns off and I light it again so we can but the average lighting time continuously like 10 minutes for each one you can say is that both of them can stay up and running continuously for up to 10 minutes but as you can see the sticky tapes couldn't withstand the high temperatures so I had to keep holding them to the end of the test that was it my friends thank you so much for watching and please give us thumbs up if you liked the video and for sure subscribe for more until then I will see you in the next one peace [Music] you [Music]", "cNloBiZwH3g": "[Music] hello today we're going to talk about the BIC or B IC mini pocket lighter so it is the green as you can see and child resistant and actually very decent quality now I needed a lighter last minute when I wanted to light birthday candles I love birthdays and I think candles are like an essential part to birthday cakes and celebrations and I love candles in general and so I felt like it would be a good idea to grab a lighter and sometimes you know lighters are just better than matches they are quicker they're more efficient and then they might even be a little safer at times this is child resistant it is extremely easy to carry in my pocket it's really small and it's just really nice overall it is a very simple mechanism here press down over here you just press and it rolls over there you go and you can light anything you need to or anything you want and it's just a very quick way of lighting and after a while I do notice that it hurts my hands but that's pretty common with a lot of lighters the red hair presses down so you hold it open the flame and then you just let go and the thing goes away you don't have to worry about anything else it's fairly full so you don't have to you know you can't really change it or anything like that and it says you know do not keep it lit for more than 30 seconds which is fine I don't think I'd want to do that anyway they come in multiple colors and this one's made of plastic it's a pretty solid plastic and as you can see the white on the bottom here and then you have the green colored here and then you also have the logo here and you might recognize the logo they make a lot of different utensils they need pens and other things like that but every big lighter undergoes more than 50 separate automatic quality checks so to ensure the safety you know because you're playing with fire well you're not playing with it but you get what I mean and then it does that during manufacturing and there is lighter fluid and inside it already you don't have to fill it up and you can't refill it's one of those disposable ones it's very handy and very intuitive you can really get the hang of it very quickly I certainly did and it's not like I use it all the time I love this about I love this in May so I bought this a little while ago and I think that it has served me very well I got it for my birthday candles I wish someone else had gotten that for me but you know candles my thing I don't travel with it if you're going through security like in an airport you probably will be asked to leave it or throw it away so just make sure you keep that in mind and it is a very small size so you would think oh it's travel size but lighters aren't like that so it's just really easy to carry in your pocket it's mini is always better and it's very quick BIC launched in 1973 and on the back here they have the warning label keep away from children even though it's child resistant ignite lighter away from face and clothing contains flammable and never exposed above 50 degrees Celsius and be sure the flame is completely out after each use you don't want to start a fire you don't want to cause any trouble people use letters for all different types of reasons and so it's just really you know good thing to have especially in your kitchen I actually don't carry mine all the time in my bag I carry I put it in like a drawer in the kitchen and bake also makes it stationary they like lighters and shavers and their designs are simple for over 60 years they've been making these lighters and they're very lightweight and it comes in pink orange yellow blue white and more so that you can just be very colorful and you can buy a bunch at the same time and it's just really nice to have thank you so much for watching this video I hope that you check these letters out if you're ever looking for one or a quick way to late birthday candles or whatever else you want to light up you", "VrWNE909TsI": "in this video I'll be showing you three simple letter tricks anybody can do them all you'll need is either a Bic lighter one of these cheapo lighters where you can adjust the size of the flame or a Zippo I'll show you a trick with each of them this trick can be done with any letter that has a lever to let the fuel low all you have to do is make a cup shape with your hand and leave a slight hole in the middle make sure it's airtight and then press the lever to fill your hand with butane fuel after about 10 to 15 seconds light the lighter and BAM for this trick you'll need an adjustable lighter you can usually buy them from the store for a dollar use a pointed object to take off the protective metal casing that is on the top of the lighter and then lift up the scroll wheel and bring it over to the left put it back down and scroll to the right do that continuously and it will increase the size of the flame exponentially just don't turn the wheel too many times or else way too much lighter fuel will come gushing out when you try to use the lighter and if it does like you might end up burning your house down if it's turned up too high then too much letter fuel come out and the letter won't be actually late at all and then I thought what if I combined the first trick with this trick warning be very careful when doing this for the last trick you'll need a Zippo I remember learning this trick from a friend back in high school the sardis trick in this video to do this trick hold the lighter between your index finger and your middle finger as well as your thumb your thumb being on the bottom or two fingers on top and you want to squeeze the lighter between your thumb and your fingers and then as you're squeezing you want to slide your two fingers on top to the back of the lighter and your thumb should pop to the front of the lighter so it's a quick popping motion you have to put some pressure on the lighter and this trick is definitely a little bit difficult and will take some practice", "m4mM7go6k5c": "this is a lighter an electronic one or\nelectric one and the buttons on this are extremely\ndifficult to depress you really want to really want to press down at force\nhere's a hack to have the button much much easier to depress\nthis works for this kind of lighters which are not refillable i have another\none which looks a little bit similar and also i have another one\nwhich is refile ball it looks different and this one is not\ngoing to work for you so let's just look for this ones\nyou may want to use a tiny tiny screwdriver like this\nand just insert it at the bottom here and just\nlift on both sides so you see that small hole here just lift it\nto detach this bump and then slide this metal cap up\nwhen you do so keep the lighter like that\ndo not bend it because you'll have bits of plastic that will drop and you cannot\nput them back in place so keep it this way and lift this thing\ngently it looks like this and when you put it\nback in place you want to may want to crush it a little bit to sit\nit tight and just flip it down and lock it you\nsee this holes here on both sides then remove this button\nand then careful with like i said with the plastic\npieces here these are two pieces which are tricky to replace put back correctly\nso keep your finger on top of them just\nlike that and then flip the lighter to remove\nthe piezo part and you notice there's a big spring\nagain keep the lighter vertical i'll show you how to put this back in place\nif you ever drop them and this is basically what happens is\nyou have a big spring which is really really stiff to depress there is\nalso a small washer here metal one between the spring\nand the plastic simply remove this washer\ndiscard the spring those them all together\nyou don't need them and then put back the piezo look\nhow it sits it sits with the metal piece in front so replace it without the\nspring drop it in there place back\nthis button which will go you notice it has kind of\nuh like a t the t goes inside this piece here there's a plastic\npiece be sure to match it correctly right\nthere you see how it sits and then put back the metal top whatever\nname is just slide it like this\nand then check it out much easier to depress look at this it's not it's not like a child is not\ngoing to depress it a small kid because this is a safety\nthing but it's so so much easier to repress\nthan before and you absolutely don't need that\nspring in there sometimes the spring is bigger you can\nreplace if you want if you have a like a pen or something\nlike this with spring inside you can cut a small piece of that spring\nwhich is much softer than this one the same size\nand just put it inside the lighter but i can tell you that\nwithout spring is the best option now this one it's a different model you\nnotice the big metal piece on top of it and also\nit's refine no i'm not sure if this is refillable maybe it's not\nlet's assume it's not but it's a completely different inside\nthis part is very difficult to remove and you can break inside the plastics\nbut i did remove on this one just to show\nand it's not exactly easy to put back in place either\nlet's just pop it from there now it looks like this\nactually this is the burning thing you have a button and i did remove it\nbefore this is the piezo part of it and this\npiezo does not have a spring at the bottom the\nspring is inside it's not possible to remove it\nso it just sits in there and it will stay\nhard to depress it's a bit annoying to put these things back in place and\nthat's not the matter for this video so try not to maybe remove it in the\nfirst place there's like a small metal tub that goes\nin there it's anyhow that's not the point here\nlet's see if you remove i have another one\nthis one will show better if you remove those plastic those plastic bits\nbut it's better not to actually i'm not going to show you how to put it back in\nplace basically if you drop the plastic pieces\ninside i recommend get another lighter right\nand do it right the next time keep your finger there so you don't drop them and\njust remove the spring because it's one dollar or so it doesn't\nmatter if you if one doesn't work you just get another\none so this is the problem with them it's really stiff and sometimes even\nstiffer than this oh this one this one some because they into the uh\nthe piece that's inside them there's also spring inside here that will stay\nthere you cannot remove it so some of them are going to be easier\nto depress while other are going to be a little bit\nmore difficult to press but removing the spring it really helps\nthe matter okay and you can do it really quick it's\njust very fast today when you get the idea", "kQb1NTi0Xg8": "hey guys today I'm going to show you how to refill an empty big lighter so what you're going to need for this is a completely empty bic lighter a pushpin preferably white some butane and three rubber grommets I'll tell you where to get these in a minute so optional items are some clippers and a file the first step is going to be to open up the valve at the bottom of the lighter now this isn't really a valve the way that big fills are lighters is they fill it through this hole it's tiny hole and then when they're done they Jam a tiny little BB in there so the best way for us to get in there is to just jam the BB into the cartridge and leave it there way to do that is to use a pushpin you put it in the hole put it on a hard surface and you push that's it you can hear that the BB is in there so your job is done when you pull this out you're going to get a little spray that's why you want to completely empty a bit lighter because you're going to get a little more spray if there's any liquid left the next step is to get your butane ready this is where you need the three rubber grommets I got these from Home Depot and a little variety pack in the hardware aisle they were extremely cheap and out of the variety pack you want the ones that fit over the nozzle perfectly you put three of them on there so that the rubber comes just a little bit past the tip of the nozzle when you're ready to go alright now we're ready to fill the pick this part is a little difficult but once you get the hang of it it's not that tough you take the nozzle that you prepared and you put it in the hole or over the hole the rubber is going to keep it sealed really well actually so put it on there and then you're going to push down well the rubber is such a good seal you're going to you're not even going to hear anything so you're going to think it's not going but let it go for a while okay it should be filled by now what you're going to do is you're going to take this off and put your thumb over it immediately so then you take your pushpin and you got to immediately put it in the hole as fast as you can obviously the faster you do it the better but you can hear it's filled with liquid there you go Vic is ready to go and working the next step is just cosmetic it takes this and turns into this so that your big lighter doesn't look that weird and it's not awkwardly shaped all you do is take some snippers and cut off the top and you file it down so I'm not going to file out here but that's what you do you don't have file use some concrete outside and that's it that's how you refill a Bic lighter", "P6rtjSfgsJc": "I fought I'd be good to do a video and what the best types of lighters are and you know look her for each category lighters what the sort of best type would be for you depending on what you want to light before so see this isn't saying any of these are definitively better than others it's saying what you want a light before and then what type of lighter is best for you so I'm not going to even go into disposables but start off with we have then get that in frame a clip lighter Clippers and fix pretty much the same thing they use a pro cm you know or Flynn sort of ignition source to create sparks there and then you hold this down for these butane gas so these are pressurized butane lighters basically so you see hold that down there light it it lights these are great little lighters you can get them very cheaply you know you get five for less than a pound each and same of the Bix is up completely personal preference what you like more Bix all these personally I prefer the Clipper design to the bit more but you will have to replace the Flint's in it every now and again and I think eventually these will wear out and of course being a flint lighter it doesn't work perfectly when it's wet so there's that to consider but for a lot of people these are all they need you can like pretty much anything with it one of the problems with these is if you're lighting something at an angle the flame can burn your hand because they're not really a directional flame so getting on to that if you want a soft flame lighter and you want something a bit you know more directional than a Bic type one you can get a pipe lighter and needs to design for smoking pipes you see when you like one of these flame comes out the side at an angle so what that means is that you basically hang it in frame got a lighter that has a directional flame that comes outside that you can adjust length get it's a lot longer although the current pulling it upwards it's a lot longer hopefully you can see they're sort of bick or a clip lights flame so if you need to like something sideways of a lighter these are much better I think these much better lighting candles and things as well because you've basically got a sideways flame and of course for the smoking pipes they're great as for and you can see there's a pipe tool in the bottom there so if you want to like a pipe this is the best type now we have the classic we have the Zippo windproof flips open this uses petrol not like and I'm trying to do it on the camera there you go so it's got a big wheel you turn to light it and the Zippo classics are really really good lighters the wind proof design is pretty good see that doesn't blow out where we've lots of lighters blowing it on like that would just blow help it always comes back the bad thing of Zippo in proofs are you will need to replace parts that's a double-edged sword because replacing the parts means it has a lifetime guarantee so that is very good about it that you know you can keep on these lighters forever if you want to just keep buying new parts for it but when bad things about a Zippo wind proof is because it's petrol or light fluid rather than you tame gas like one of these it means it's not pressurized so you lose fuel over time I think these are one the best light is on the market Potter you know really suppose they're 10 pounds each there's not very much for what you get classic design really solidly built male made they last forever if you look after and properly like you know serviced them etc by changing apart but as I said that petrol so they do leak and butane in many ways is superior is a cleaner fuel and you know you can do more of it next we have on my favorite type of lighters these particular get in survival situations or if you really want a really hot flame they are jet lighters and a jet lighter sprays a jet out in one direction that's very very hot they're much hotter than any of the other types of lighters they like anything fastest and ice at the very hot very directional flames and you can go to the extremes and get the sort of triple and quadruple flame cigar lighters like these they give off an insane amount of heat if you want to literally dry anything out might anything these are light as you want to go for if you're lighting cigars and definitely get one of these you like the cigar evenly you know quickly and I think for survival situations a jet lighter is the best you can keep it dry simply because of how hot the flame is so if you're trying to light a campfire say in you know wet conditions you wouldn't be messing about one of these you could get it lit really quickly you can solder these as well and things like that these are really hot so yeah the lights like these are really good I would completely recommend one of the jet lighters now we have an arc lighter which is a much more modern thing it's basically like a little taser inside a lighter I think these are really gimmicky to be honest trying it yes you can light a cigarette with it you can like people with it the issue is the tops of these get in the way basically there's a safety mechanism that's clever built into this where once you close the lid enough it shuts it off so you can't show it in your pocket or set yourself on fire you know bit in your pocket that's a really clever design however the problem is the lid gets in the way when you're trying to like something in a tight space and that is a problem so like I said lighting a cigarette is fine if you just want to light a cigarette so I'm sure this would be perfect and it looked really cool you know if you're showing off to people but it's not that practical this is the problem if they improve these in the future they might be good you know different type of lid and safety mechanism the pylons spaced further apart so you can get them into a tighter space you know or even a much shorter pylon so you can send an arc out across with literally nothing on the sides that would be really cool but the issue is how they are at the moment they get in the way so these are charged off your USB and you're meant to get about a week's worth of if you are heavy smoker a week's worth of lighting cigarettes of one before they run out of battery need charging again then you get something like 500 for recharges before the battery wears out so they're cool give you that but as I said the problem of them is they're not that practical for lighting anything up in cigarettes and looking cool I don't think there's much use in them personally for me I like butane torch lighters the most and I do have a survival model coming of a butane torch you soon which is a completely waterproof one you know that's designed for survival situations in mine so that should probably my best letters and other than that something like this especially on an electric ignition would serve you well enough a clipper or a Bic if you're just a normal smoker and just want a lighter for everyday use pipe lighters if you want to do something more special with it you know because it's got the angled flame they're really nice I think you can get some very nice looking pipe lighters as well I have a ones other than this one um and as I said Zippo for that sort of classic design you know when the most famous lighter designs ever just be aware the petrol evaporates and it's not such a clean fuel and you will need to replace parts on it so that's the lighter types so what's the best light a few depends on what you want it for for me probably jet lighters thanks for watching you", "7d8wOkLge64": "[Music] okay so these are the lighters that are different lighters that i use and this is the stickers that i print out on my pretty printed out on my previous video guys tongue twister okay um these stickers are 2.75 by 2.34 and that's my standard sizing for all of my lighters these two lighters came from dollar tree these two lighters came from dollar general so these are torch lighters these are the regular this is a refillable flame lighter and this is just a regular electronic lighter so now i already did this one i'm gonna put this sticker on this one what i like to do is just line it up right in the middle and then press you press on each side and then you press down the back there's a lip right here we'll cut that off later now this slider is a refillable electronics torch i guess i'm just going to place that right in the middle too press down press on the sides and press to the back oh i use like shipping tape from dollar tree to seal my lighters this is what i do take a piece off longer than the lighter it doesn't have to be that one place it on there like i place the sticker cut off the excess the bulk of the excess and make sure you rub it on good back and forth so that you don't get any bubbles any air bubbles now sometimes the tape that's over this will cause the air bubble so it's good to kind of like cut a slit right there for now so that you can um lay that flat now that's the front of the lighter the back of the bladder still need some now just take it and get close with a little bit of overlay on the side just spread it i do like to save all of my extra tape for like anything that i might need for packaging and shipping or something like that so just press down make sure there's no bubbles and that's how i feel my lighter now are you gonna do from here take exactly knife clean it up and just place right along the top of the sticker and what i do is just set my knife down and then i roll the lighter applying a little bit of pressure not too much pressure and that's going to also cut that lip off there just find a spot to kind of lift up on that tape and there you have it this is the the part that of the sticker that you cut off just kind of take that off you might have to go back over it with the x-acto knife just to clean it up a little bit there's a top now let's do bottom like i said i place the exacto knife down with pressure and i roll the lighter that is how i feel my letters very simple now watch me feel the rest okay be careful once you touch you don't want to lift it up if you do have to lift it back up be very very careful because it'll rip your print right off so so and this is how i seal my lighters thanks for watching don't forget to hit that like and subscribe button and the bell also", "IkZLJiuVsGg": "What's up every everybody! Welcome back to my Laboratory where safety is number one priority! and today I'm going to put to the test this multi tool lighter let's see what they all about For the first lighter right here look at that beautiful design BOOM! Fits your palm pretty good and right here there is a little chain that you can hook it up into your pocket or backpack and put it in pocket so you don't lose it and what's so special about this lighter right here you push this down and it's going to light up That fire is green how amazing is that Have you ever have seen a green fire lighter? I haven't, this is my first one and I was amazed when I found one I was like whoa I have to have it How cool is that! Also it has a flashlight right here BOOM! Also there is another flashlight and actually it's a black light Whoa that's awesome you know what's black light is? maybe you can use that black light to see if there is stains on our bed sheets in a hotel or motel wherever you are staying Who knows I have never seen a black light on a lighter or any kind of gadget that's awesome and a another tool right here BOOM! this is right here is a wine opener let's try to open a bottle of wine see if it's actually durable or not to open a bottle of wine Gotta take of this part BOOM! you can take  it off like that Okay we are just going to screw this in Nice it's works all the way since it's soo short ah man ah it's hard You know what guys this is a second time it just destroys the cork but still overall I love this design I love how this lighter is green fire I just wish the wine opener was a little bit longer so that way it would be a little bit easier to open a bottle of wine But cool part is right here is a can opener as well Black light, flash light and green fire lighter how cool is that So good we got here another lighter and it comes flash you open it up like that and right here you pull it down and look at that flame it's like a torch but it's a blue flame like a regular lighter and it's little torch it's Epic Very powerful and right here there is a knife you can actually use this knife to cut all this aluminium foil on a wine bottle and also it has this wine wire BOOM! You see how much different this is It's way shorter and right here is way shorter as well it doesn't have another natch right here so this why I couldn't open it with this um wine opener So hopefully this one will not disappoint and I'm actually pretty sure it will be very easy to open bottle of wine with this lighter First of all I'm going to put it into the cork Then it will just like a wine opener put it like that put it down like this and pull it up BOOM! (pops up) Easy wow this lighter definitely  works really well But it does not have a flashlight or the black light So very different lighter but although it has a knife and it's only blue flame so I wish this lighter had a better wine opener because this lighter has a green fire and a flash light you be the judge which lighter do you like better I wish this one just had a knife and did not had a wine opener would have been an amazing lighter But I'm pretty sure you can still open it shipped bottle of wine with this kind of wine opener the short one Let me know in comments below if you have a same a torch lighter like that with a wine opener in a back of it I have never seen it before and when I saw it I was like whoa I have to have it and show it to you Amazing thumbs up for me This right here another super Epic lighter first of all let's try to spark it and see what happens BOOM! You got yourself a green firelighter That would be beautiful doesn't it? Thumbs up this video if you have never seen a green fire lighter, torch lighter, it's Epic and it looks like a grenade design super cool and also right here there is a little lock if you open it there is a little safety close it open and right here there is a little button let's press it and see what happens BOOM! Look at that knife, quick released knife very small knife so I think it's more like a box opener BOOM! Look at that Very sharp knife not a toy and to close it all you have to do is press it and close it lock it so that way it cannot pop out you cannot press it by mistake right here safety pin you unlock it BOOM! That's awesome Let's do  this again so quick love that Huge thumbs up for me for this lighter because you got yourself a green fire and a quick release knife Love it For the next lighter looks like a revolver look at that pretty cool huh there's right here a little lock and when you press it let's see how do you unlock it I guess it doesn't fly out Oh yeah it does BOOM! check this out this is cool similar knife like this one fly's out when you press it and to close it you have to press it again and close it and if you don't want it to open it anymore just press this down and look if I press it nothing opens cannot be open open it again BOOM! and just a little bit longer knife but I think this knife is just a little bit thicker than this one so you be the judge which you like better and right here just a blue flame torch so this lighter definitely beats this lighter but if you prefer this design better than I'm sure you wanna get this one than instead of that one and couple more design for those people who likes to take care of their nails pop it open if you have nails you could probably pop it a lot easier and right here BOOM! look at that there is a little nail cutter How cool is that? Never seen a lighter with a nail clippers that's amazing and if you press right here BOOM! you see you got here a lighter and it heats up really really hot pretty awesome and it's a different kind of lighter it's just a coil heated coil lighter whatever they call But I just wanted to get it because I saw a nail clippers on this lighter and that was just so cool then they have a nail clippers and a lighter at the same time and the last lighter right here I love that color, how it reflects Beautiful so all you have to do is open it and it heats up that coil in the middle on this side the same thing then if you don't want to use it anymore, close it and right here just a simple little knife I just though it was different lighters and I wanted to get it and show it to you By the way in both of these lighters you can use android charger and just plug it in to the computer to charge it this one's are the electric lighter. Well guys it's pretty much it let me know in comments below which gadget was your favorite and thank you for watching and don't forget to give this video a thumbs up and I will see you next time.", "5wgEq9CQy0M": "okay so today I'm gonna show you how to make a jet lighter it I'll say it's pretty dangerous cuz you're gonna be using of needles yeah so we need those okay okay first step you're gonna need to take light-up board take it apart make sure you keep this you can either later okay so you see where the gas comes up right you're gonna put the needle in there what first you're gonna have to cut it cut it in half okay so now I take your needle and push it in there not too far just push it up his smoke in there just make sure it's stuck there we go this is what it should look like just to make sure doesn't come out okay so now you're gonna take the top band the two side up break it okay you should have something like that and just clip it back on you are good to go [Music]", "Jsj9gaLOLmU": "hello and welcome to the blackhat bushcraft Channel today let's take a close look at the Clipper lighter and today I'll show you the features and functions and explain why I feel like this may be the best lighter for the woodsman stick with me and let's take a closer look first of all clipper lighters come in a lot of different colors and as you can see with these several of them are very bright colors which are great choices for the woodsman I really like this orange of course this yellow also contrasts even the blue or the white contrast will with a natural environment should you drop it on the forest floor but of all of these the one did I think I liked the best is this one that you can see through because you always know exactly where you stand with your fluid I think that that's a really good option with that but outside of that the one that I've carried the most over the last couple of weeks has been this orange one several of those would be great options to carry in the woods regardless of your experience level as a woodsman I think it's always a wise decision to carry with you instant fire whether that means you're carrying storm proof matches in a waterproof container or some type of a lighter whether it be a disposable lighter like a Bick or some other brand maybe you carry a refillable butane lighter or even a Zippo they're all good options it just comes back to your personal preference for me I've carried every one of those at some point and I tend to always come back to the disposable bit lighter just because it's widely available it's very cost effective and these things really last for a long while for me overall I've had great experience with this type of lighter I recently shot a video where I gave out some tips and tricks of things that you can use with your big lighter and I had a subscriber that commented to me that they much prefer the clipper style lighter over the bit I wasn't really familiar with a clipper lighter so I got on the internet started doing a little research and I ended up ordering some clipper lighters and for the last couple of weeks I've carried this thing with me everyday and actually carried it through a survival training class this past weekend and I gotta say I'm really impressed with it because it has a few key features that the big lighter doesn't that I think just may make it be the perfect lighter to carry in the woods so I wanted to show you this lighter today and go through the key features that I think might make it a step above just a standard big so stick with me and let's take a look at those one by one just before I got started showing you the actual features of the lighter I thought I'd give you a size comparison side-by-side with a standard big lighter you can see that the Clipper is a little bit smaller overall and where the BIC is more of an oval shape you can see that the Clipper is more of a rounded shape lighter let's talk about the first key feature that gives this clipper the advantage over the standard BIC let's say that we're going to go on an outing maybe it's an overnight camping trip or several days even a week let's say that I carried this bit with me for the last several months and I've used it a lot in the course at that time so do I just go out carrying this big lighter not knowing how much fluid I have in it or do I have to go to the store and buy a brand new lighter so that I can be confident that I have that resource that 100% should I need it that's the advantage that the Clipper has because this lighter well it's a disposable lighter it's refillable so you can use a standard refill butane container plug it right in here to the bottom there's a port right here in the bottom and fill this lighter back up to 100% you don't have to go out and buy a brand new one you can take the one you have and fill it back up I really like that option instead of walking around with that half full lighter you can always keep it full as much as you want to refill it it may not be easy to see but right here is that refill port that you can use a standard butane refill container to fill this lighter up with the other feature that I think really sets this clipper lighter apart from other disposable type lighters is the fact that the entire striker wheel and Flint assembly is removable from the lighter now this part is interchangeable with any other clipper lighter so if you had one lighter that was out of fluid and another lighter that was out of flint you could take this piece out of the one and put it into the other I really like this feature for the fact that if my lighter should be submerged in water and get soaked this makes it so much easier and faster to dry it out you can also get right down get your finger down to that port where the fluid comes out for flame and that makes it easier to dry that out as well and I'll demonstrate that for you in just a minute it's also very easy here to unscrew this piece and hopefully these small features will show up on the camera but you unscrew this piece right here and now I can remove the spring and the Flint and this is just a standard cigarette lighter Flint like a Zippo type Flint that you might buy sure it's hard to see that but that is replaceable as well so should my Flint give out in the case that I'm refilling this lighter over time the Flint eventually will wear out this allows me to replace that and I'm told that you can put two Flint's in this tube at one time so that you automatically have a refill and that the spring will still function properly with that I haven't tested that because I don't have replacement Flint's at this time but it's something I will test all right so I'm gonna dump that clipper right into the cup of water it's currently on my phone 316 I'll leave it in for a few minutes and then rescue it and see how long it takes to get flame again it's now 320 on my phone so the lighters been under for about 4 minutes or so you can see still fully submerged here right this is a very simple process all I'm gonna do first of all lighters not functioning just gonna remove this housing I can rub it off on my shirt shake the lighter out blow into it a little bit housing is pretty much dry just using breath to blow it off dry it off of my pants starting to get minimal sparks there alright just to show that I can hear the fluid insert this back in and there's the funny for rescuing a lighter I say the clipper definitely has the advantage the other aspect to this feature that I really like is let's say that the lighter was completely depleted of fuel now I remove the Flint striker housing out and this becomes an improvised fire starting tool there's actually a device very similar to this this marketed for this purpose let's say you had a cotton ball with Vaseline maybe some dryer lint or some real fun material like this this right here will ignite that and still give you a flame in the case that the lighter itself can't do it I'll demonstrate that feature for you as well this is just a dead branch of a tulip poplar tree and by scraping it with the spine of my knife I'm creating these ultrafine fibers here which hopefully will accept a spark and create flame pretty easily all right I've got my clipper lighter here let's assume that it's completely out of fluid so what I'm gonna do is remove the Flint housing here and I've got this small little pile of fine fibers of tulip poplar inner bark that I processed with the spine of my knife and I'm going to see if this Flint housing will throw enough sparks to ignite that material I don't particularly expect it to be easy just hope Oh was easier than I expected with that I achieve open flame with no fluid for my lighter only using this part of the lighter and now I could quickly add material to that once I have that open flame to extend it and create a fire so as you can see this clipper lighter really does have some unique features in comparison to other disposable lighters in the market the fact that you can refuel this lighter to a hundred percent capacity on every outing I think it's very valuable also the ability to replace or carry an extra flint on board I think are great options as well it's especially important to the woodsman that you can open this lighter up like this and dry it out very quickly and get it functioning once again even if submerged for several minutes and in my mind is extremely valuable that you can take this striker wheel housing out and use it as an improvised ignition source even with natural materials in the woods for all of those reasons I believe that this clipper lighter will become a lighter of choice to carry in my emergency kit of course I'll continue to test it over time for durability and things like that but overall just because of the features I think that this might become my everyday carry lighter as far as cost-effectiveness goes these are very comparable if not cheaper than big lighters you can go on Amazon and order them in multi packs and if you order a larger amount of them you can actually get them for less a dollar the pack that I ordered put these at about a dollar and 20 cents apiece and well worth it in my opinion the nice thing about a video like this is I'm not selling clipper lighters and I have nothing to gain by promoting it it's just an interesting product that someone shared with me and so I figured that passed that home because for the reasons that I've shown you in this video I feel like this letter stands out as a great option for the woodsman bushcrafter or just for the average person that wants to carry instant flame within for all of these reasons I think that this lighter might be a great choice and I figured I'd share that with you guys I appreciate your time and interest I hope you found this to be interesting and informative if you haven't subscribed to hope you will hope you'll give the video a thumbs up and a hook most importantly that you'll come back often as I hope to be talking to you with another video again very soon and until that one take care and God bless", "rUuFrlEaT2k": "hey guys welcome back to the man Tube channel we're here with yet another product review for you and I'm son purchase that we picked up a while back I wanted to get the review gun and done today we're gonna be talking about the big mini lighter the little guys Hey look at his little thing no bigger than the size of your thumb so really guys we're gonna get into this I mean there's nothing else to say it is on like Donkey Kong and these guys really do what you need them to benefits over matches is that these will white hundreds of Lights again I got this in a kind of a you know we were just a regular standard postal package it did not come in standardized you know big you know packaging who cares the material is fine and the the lighters work I got a six pack of them I believe they were less than a dollar apiece free shipping him rather quickly but again in regards of a comparison to from the large to the small let's bring a large one in in size-wise okay well they're both pretty much brand new one is the third of the size weight wise and again these will light 3,000 lights or a standard light which means continuous flame for one hour great this guy will do a third of that the weights standard no problem and the best part about Bicks is that they tend to survive even if you drop them into water whatever let them dry out maintain and keep your Flint in there and it's gonna work they all come with the standard child safety lock again they can be removed but of course the company doesn't recommend that again easy enough to light fits in the palm of the hand rather simple and for me it's just a quick light like that I hold it again it's just it's easier to carry sometimes then the larger counterpart grade item again they last and this will go for a continuous flame with 20 minutes 1,000 light to 20 minutes the large ones are 3,000 lights or an our so okay there you go I mean it's pretty simple as far as if we're gonna give it a thumbs up thumbs down on two thumbs scale two thumbs up guys can't beat the price shipping is on point the items are real not two never garbage they work they stand the test of time they're timeless devices in

guys welcome back to the shop today just to follow up to my how to refill a disposable lighter or how to refill a Bic lighter video it's been blowing up lately for some reason and I've been getting a lot of questions from people on different things they can use as gaskets to try to seal the hole when filling it and I have a little bit of a plethora of things here that we can try just to MacGyver the hell out of it you know not everybody has hardware stores near where they live or has access to the same that I have so I figured I'd try to sample a few different things and I haven't tried any of these we're gonna try to experiment together so let's see what works and let's see what doesn't so first obviously you need an empty lighter this one has a little bit in it almost gone but you'll hear it there it goes now it's completely empty alright so let's go ahead and try a rubber band now a big rubber band would work but if you have a little brother or sister or somebody that has braces and maybe they have these smaller little rubber bands it would be just be a lot easier than having to try and wrap this around you know X amount of times it would just take a lot longer I think then then having then using this one here all right so can you see how I have that little rubber band just wrapped around tightly right there at the very tip let's go ahead and give that a try see if it'll fill again just a regular standard bic lighter mm not a tight enough seal I don't think alright let maybe let's try a the bigger rubber bands you have to see if that works alright that seems to be a little bit better ding that's cold oh did you see that some came out whoa oh there we go we got it rubber band works so now when you take it off you want to cover with your thumb quickly it's pretty cold here today but I guarantee you there's stuff in there you can hear it it's just really cold in my shop there it is look at that so there you go rubber band works go ahead and check that off okay have another lighter here this one's got a little bit left in it also go ahead and drain that out let's see I have a little piece of clay here this is just some modeling clay I think this would actually work pretty well but again it's pretty cold out here in a shop let me have two well I think that this is probably gonna work the same as this reusable adhesive putty stuff this blue stick yeah I'll just hold it I'll put this in my hand and let it warm up a little but in the meantime we can go ahead and try this stuff here we'll just get a small little good mmm take the rubber band off all right let's work this around the tip okay that boom I think this is gonna work good it's fillion it's got a little leak but it's filling oh there we go there we go number two so this stuff here works well and I'm assuming if this was warmer this clay because it's almost the same consistency like I said it's just really cold out here so it's very stiff but I would say that this would probably work just as well as that moving on I have here some surgical tubing and what I'm gonna do is just gonna cut off a little bit of this end here and then you see we just have a little bit so now I'm gonna slice that in half down one side or I guess you could slice it in half all the way there we go so now we have an open piece of tubing it's was like that and then I cut it open go ahead just poke a little hole in the middle again get an empty lighter oh this one was completely empty and will flop that over like that yeah let's go ahead and try this now oh yeah I think that's getting a nice tight seal I think this is actually working best out of all of them surgical tubing works there you go guys all like I said all this is just proof of concept you know I I'm not even gonna try this I really don't think that's gonna make a nice tight seal this is just hard rubber it's not an Oreo and then this was just a little rubber washer that I was essentially just gonna do the same thing I did with this so there you go man I just thought I'd share that with you just a little follow up I know like I said people have been having some questions about what would work if you didn't have a nice rubber gasket get some modeling clay get some stick adhesive probably bubblegum would work a pencil eraser might work you know the sky's the limit guys just God like I said MacGyver the hell out of it so there you go guys thanks for sticking around checking it out hope you guys enjoyed the video don't forget to give it a like subscribe share with your friends and as always I will catch you on the next one it works it works", "zcUGJ7Jo-68": "what's up guys for today's video I'm going to put to the test lighter Armour and that's supposed to fit with the Zippo as you can see it's not made by Zeebo so it's probably won't even fit perfectly but let's start out and see if it actually works this is a quick release button by opening this up and to close it you gotta press it as well oh geez quick it in okay I have a new zip lighter as well I don't think I'll fit the whole thing so the only thing you wrote it is inserts you know you don't have to buy the Zippo one they also make different ones - why it's actually a perfect fit I can't believe it that is looks really cool now you have armored survival lighter and it's still a zipper you know what's cool about this in this kind of case is a lot of times once you fill it with a lighter fluid the lighter fluid will just wire it but hopefully with this thing because there is a lobbying and it will be water-resistant hopefully it won't evaporating as much okay guys I just filled it up very nice I love Zippo lighter something about them almost like of oil lamps okay there you go that's much better close it one more time the main test I wanna see if it's waterproof we're gonna sink it obviously it's too heavy to float now go take it out shake it off and let's see if it slides up I like to shake off most of the water so when I open it it doesn't put in enough doesn't look like this in your water inside ah I should have cleaned off my hand let me die it off a little bit you know what let's start by itself without the lighter see if it's going to come out with any bubbles because my fingers were wet I was taking it and I think I got the Flint wet so it does not stack I got a weight jobs dies out while I dine out I'm going to put this under water as you can see when it's not heavy it has no problem I don't know does it gets any bubbles does not look like it and it still floats so so far so good I'll move this away let's open it okay I don't see any water now it's just shaking off I think from the lighter but I did not see any water inside so it passed the test for sure the only thing is make sure whenever you start it Zippo lighter stack it with dry hands you know what kind of annoying it is little bit hard to strike out here because this thing is in a way quite a lot actually you cannot get that good full strike in that's why it takes me three times to light up I just say Oh why's that but see you're pretty awesome work syllable boom also the best part about it it is super easy to take in and out so I like that a lot put it back in our original case I actually have another gadget it called flip light let's open it up see what's all about so as you can see it's similar to a Zippo lighter but all it is is a light you put your body into here okay will it work still or they go it'd have to be plugged in and to here then you would have to turn it on and off okay will it fit into the zipper case that's a really cool design and whenever we close it it shuts off automatically by pressing this button so everybody will think oh you got that here a Zippo lighter nope it's just a Zippo flashlight or fully apply also probably could fit onto here - why does work in the distant as well you just flip this up boom so you don't even have to have a Hippolyta I think it's yeah it shuts it off - I like it so now you have here waterproof light okay we would actually walk and it's flawed about now that is not that heavy because Zippo lighters are heavy it's all metal so submerge it gonna wipe it off a little bit get rid of that moisture so it does not gets inside of it as soon as I open it much better oh did you see it as soon as I start open it look at that you see the light start turning on as soon as I try to open it that is so cool so you can see how it works I love it so now I have here mini waterproof flashlight also I can put it in a Zippo lighter as well I like it interchangeable Gajic side here you got it here zipper insert butane lighters there's a single jet and do jet they also have come out with an electric lighter insert but I could not find it they were out of stock so this is some kind of opened Zippo lighter insert so if you put it in one of those into your Zippo it is really hard to take it out but they also made one of this dual are quite a bicep or something similar like that better than this one but that's what I got cause I could not find any so you need zero fill and just like that you put it in and fill it up very simple this one works pretty good and the best part is now that we can grab a Zippo Zippo lighter that takes lighter fluid always vibrates really easily you flip this in put it in and boom you got a Zippo lighter that flips over but at the same time you have right here built in lighter but it still looks as if oh and made by jeepers how cool is that why did they wait so long to do this and you can use any zipper insert very cool right you have a dog jet that turns off very slowly probably have to adjust that adhere make - a bit see if it's going to be much better oh yeah nice shuts off instantly now you can put it again into zero lighter close it and actually work it like a go a Zippo lighter how cool is that dual jet you want a single jet no problem replaceable and if you want your original you see I don't like Zippo lighters as much because every time I fill it up I put that lighter for a couple of months maybe even like six months then I go up and it's never works it's lighter it's out pretty quickly didn't lie to us you don't have to worry about it so you put it back in but something about Zippo lighters that you can just light it up and hold it like that is also amazing I just wish they would not lose the lighter fluid so easily again you can replace it and then put in one of this arc lightest weight our own way this way you can't have to take it out I'm now put it all the way cuz they'll get stuck so you got yourself a Zippo lighter you can open it and you can have electric lighter as a zipper insert but they make a way better one that is actually by zipper and it fits much better because now I most likely will need pliers to take it out so every time you try to buy off-brand piece it's never fits again in the same place they said here is pretty good fit but now it's not coming out but at the same time I have Zippo lighter or electric lighter they're very very awesome so if you buy this one buy Zippo because dark lighter it will be much easier to take off the inserts so if you guys love Zippo lighters like I do this is definitely an awesome upgrade for your Zippo lighter you can definitely make it much much cooler stuff with your Zippo lighter casing well guys that's pretty much it let me know in comments below what do you think about this zipper inserts I think it's really cool I love them when they make really cool gadgets or upgrade some one of the best lighters anyways let me know I come into the what what do you think about this video don't forget to thumbs up subscribe and I'll see you next time you", "GxQAgZOcqSI": "so what I want to talk about today is my journey for fire my EDC journey for fire I rarely use a lighter for anything but there is times where you know if it's fabric I need to singe or you know light something or in the rarest of cases if I had to start fire to stay warm if something something were to happen my vehicle stopped running or or whatever it may be it's just it's very much a preparedness type device that you can make pretty small so to carry something everyday that gives you fire the benefit outweighs the pocket space so the reason why I make in this particular video is I've always really liked Zippos I think they look really cool they're american-made which is great they have a fidget factor to them and you know they really do round out an EDC look whether you smoke or not just they look really cool right what I didn't realize is the type of fuel Zippo uses and not even the type of fuel just really the design of a Zippo lighter as you lose your fuel source through evaporation now I've heard different different metal types like brass on brass has a better seal I got to imagine though with the wick in the opening you're still gonna get gassing gas off evaporation probably just as quickly like I said I didn't know this so when I purchased my Zippo I purchased a smaller one so it'll fit my key pocket or my coin pocket whatever and whatever you call it and I really liked it but I started to notice that I would get two weeks maybe and it won't work anymore so I just kind of dealt with it I convinced myself you know at least at least if it is out of fuel you still have flint right the throws a spark pretty well you might be able to start something start some kindling on fire with that and then I decided you know maybe I should look into butane lighters and through that I discovered you know you could get a butane lighter for Zippo basically get a butane insert for Zippo so instead of having having the fuel this way you have an actual insert that's a torch butane lighter that's pretty cool I get to keep the cool look I get to you know keep the fuel retention there's one problem though they don't make it for the small Zippo I don't know if you can tell this is the smaller not the full-size Zippo the size of the lighter is important to me earlier I mentioned pocket space well my pocket real estate is precious to me I don't want to carry a full-size Zippo now that might change down the road there may be a time that a time that comes where I decide you know what just bite the bullet get the full-size Zippo and get the butane insert that could happen down the line what I started to realize though is a standard BIC I've got tons of them the small BIC standard sized BIC they're all relatively small and they don't take up a lot of pocket space and furthermore I've got Bix I've owned for years that's how rare it is that I use use lighters but the fact that they lasted for all those years they're so inexpensive especially the smaller one they take up almost no space at all I decided you know why don't we abandon this guy and why don't we just go back to carrying good old-fashioned Bick now this is fine but what I find is it's pretty easy to compress this and lose all your gas so I'm in the same boat here nice small size losing my fuel resource so I looked for awhile and what I found I found this and when I say I found this I bought this guy for two reasons so dolphin it's obviously Chinese or Japanese Chinese rather j5 is the model they make different sizes this is the mini bic I did this for two reasons one I wanted to dress up my boring lighter right so this gives it a better look it goes in further I'm not pushing it in all the way though cuz it is kind of hard to get out you have to push it from the bottom to get it out but you know it dresses up the lighter makes my EDC not look so cheap this is great the thickness of the metal is great but what I realized is this is a win-win for me and I don't know if you noticed earlier at the beginning of the video but I actually have this like this and this is actually how I carry it which is perfect I can't depress the button for fuel it's protected it's down on the bottom here it's pretty easy to get at so when I do go to use it I'll either just pop it out use my lighter see how it works amazing huh I've had this thing for like four years and guess what fire what a shock pose to this guy so for me this is a win-win looks unique I've never seen anyone do this I've never seen anyone flip it this way easy-to-access keeps the button protected and I think it looks great so yeah I just wanted to share that this was an Amazon pickup for me I think it ran me six seven bucks moving forward whenever I need whenever this guy runs out of fuel I'll just pick up one of these small guys for I don't even know how much they are I'm sure they're a buck or less and I can continue on with my life minimal pocket space taken up still has a good look to it I still have fire it's a win win win let me know what you guys all think in the comments please like if this is helpful if you've also had lighter experiences that are good or bad please share because I'm always evolving my pocket EDC and for me this was initially a big win I loved it I loved the size the smallness but the practicality of it for fuel retention was just not there so I'd be curious to know if you guys are using electric lighters butane lighters refillable butane lighters I'd love to hear your experiences what works what doesn't work you know for me if I did smoke and I use this thing every day and I just knew I had to refill it every couple weeks or every week just make that habit this would probably be fine but I want to put it in my pocket I want to forget about it and then the moment I need it I throw it out it's reliable I can use it so yeah thank you hope this is helpful", "9csLoxU94dY": "here's a basic lighter comparison of a Zippo wind proof lighter it retails for right around $20 and then your standard bic lighter that you can buy at pretty much any gas station so is the $20 wind proof Zippo lighter really worth it well let's find out first we'll just light them up this is just the inside burn all right pretty basic but then we'll go outside and really sure the difference I would sight on a pretty breezy day we'll go ahead and get the Zippo going and now for the BIC just breezing aft or you can see I can't even keep the bit going there you go oh it's as if I worth it I'd say yes in my opinion you", "oA7cEobpBwg": "many lighters don't undergo proper safety testing which can lead to unpredictable flame heights or worse that's why you should always choose a BEC each bic lighter undergoes more than 50 automatic quality and safety checks bic safety you can count on", "tMZvqxS8TSs": "[ __ ] all right i'll do the tutorial okay this is like my second time recording this let's get back to that since you guys have been roasting me the past couple of months because i didn't show you how to actually make lighter i'm gonna be showing you now first thing you're gonna need is cutting mat why because you don't want your table looking like freddy krueger's dining table okay another thing you're going to need i'm just going to take them all are these needles right here they're actually i don't know they have a name so if you're named for these they're just hard needles that won't break whenever you're stitching you can find them in tandy later ebay amazon wherever you want just look just search hard needles this a lot of questions on this this is a freaking iron and it's 4.0 millimeters this i used to make the stitching holes for lighter how you actually get this lighter case well just go rob the local walmart and you'll kind of get them just kidding just go to etsy there's people signing and selling them individually i got mine by buying them in bulk and alibaba so if you're starting just don't do it just buy one first and exactly knife this can actually kill people so if you're under 18 and using this just make sure you're using gloves i have this little thing right here i don't remember what it's called but i bought it a candy letter leave it dandy leather my bad and i use this just to like add a little bit of you know flavor to the hole when i'm stitching if you know what i mean of course you're gonna need fabric you might ask yourself how i got this fabric so i just went to the gucci store and i asked them for fabric and they gave it to me they were very nice no just go to ebay buy a vintage bag and make sure is a coded canvas it may be called pvc or some stuff like that but just make sure whenever you're talking to the seller if it's a coated canvas it's going to be this fabric there's another fabric that you used to use probably still uses that's not going to work for the lighter so make sure it's this one or you will be disappointed of course you're gonna you're gonna need a ruler you're gonna need patience and you're gonna need money to do this so let's go so when you get your piece of fabric like this what we're gonna do is do you know l double l times whatever i don't remember i didn't pay attention to so the length is going to be 6.1 try to do 6.1 6.2 centimeters length and the width i usually do if i remember correctly 6.8 just to have a little bit more but we're gonna see now we're gonna see if it works we're gonna see if it doesn't so we got it the width you know it's not that hard you know if you want to first grade you can do this if you skip first grade then you can i want to give you some tips uh some tips for the long run so whenever you're cutting down the fabric make sure you hold the ruler really hard because it might move around a little bit and whenever you're cutting the fabric make sure you have don't just make sure you always get a little bit more fabric to work on see i have a little bit more fabric to work on here so i'll just cut it but you always want more fabric um than less fabric because then maybe you you're short and it's going to look something like this you know you don't want to be too you don't want it to be short you want it to have more and you can work with what you have so whenever i do this i do the i eyeball this so i just like crunch it like this and take it from all the sides see trying to put on the camera and focus for you guys to see then we go so okay so this is the hardest part for us people that are not talented at station at all like me so you're gonna need two needles for this one i don't even remember how the stitching is called if you guys want all those details then i'm sorry i don't have them you can use any color station i prefer using brown to match the lighter but it's to 2020 and you can be whatever you want so you can use whatever you want so i did something like this [Music] you guys better look up something for station because i'm really bad at it and i just stick my thing in here i don't even know how to record this how am i going to record this for you guys to see see i just put it through and then i put it through it let me focus on that one then i put it through the the needle i just pull it like this easy then pull it again perfecto now we do that with the other one so we do it on both sides i'm gonna do this with this one now so i just get some more fabric make sure you have a lot of um thread you don't want to run out of thread in the middle of this dish because you're going to have start again you're going to have to start again and maybe you're going to ruin it so we do it again we go like this as you know it's like having relationships first time it's hard then it gets easier and there you go here we have it we have the two [Music] we have the two they're connected voila now we're going to be adding some bit of glue to the fabric itself just add a little bit you do this because you want the it to be easier when you're stitching the fabric onto the lighter case you don't want it all moving around and everything then you just like press it here and hold it for a little bit try making it you know perfect to look perfect you know it's like sticking your fingers in see now it's good to go to this station so how you start this dish is you just put one side of the needles through i already have it here i'm not gonna record it again pull it out i've been doing this for like 80 hours already after you put the needle through first time you go and do it again same holes and you have your first one right here this is called a cross stitch so then i'm trying to show you how you actually do it because i don't know how to explain it the needle through remember there's two needles in this i'm not showing it i'm not trying anything in the video because i don't know how to record it but yeah i have two needles then you get the other needle put it it's gonna be like the next i think it's called a cross stitch i don't know you can search it online you might find something but it's just like it gets into an x you see right here let me show you something like that and you keep going so here we have it as you can see it's more like an x every time you're doing the stitch i'm gonna put a link down below on a tutorial how to do this i'm going to be my video it's going to be somebody else's video so you might see how to do it but yeah here's the lighter if you like this

you've been watching any other video on my channel you know I like to do a lot of painting videos so I'm gonna be doing another one today but tip but this time I'm gonna be painting a tiny bit lighter and if you've owned a bit lighter you know for sure you've never actually bought one like they just turn up I bet you people probably steal them and then you steal them for the people that stole them and it's just a constant cycle of people stealing lighters so I decided that since I have a unusual amount of lighters just hanging out I might as well just put a cool design on it and paint it so if you want to see me do that feel free to stick around and watch the rest of this video and if not then at least like comment and subscribe and go watch some of my other videos that you might like if

satisfy on me to love them Gigi's pesto with cash flow with excess puts on and whatever's your last heart", "OasMyunFjbQ": "what up butts good it's your girl local town and today we're getting it lit in this business we're making lighters and they came out so adorable so gorgeous listen here's the blue one purple I made this one I had a broken heart so a lot of emotions went into this one and it came out so good and then lastly I have this gorgeous pink one and it's kind of looks I want it to look like a wand like this is your magic stick like bam fire I'm a magician but yeah let's get right into it check them out check them out up close you can see just how adorable these lighters came out I decided to create a unique style and look for each lighter you should leave me a comment down below letting me know out of these three lighters which one is your favorite sweet let's get started so I walked over to the gas station and bought some lighters making sure that they were full and worked correctly next you want to peel all the stickers and wrapping off what you will need some strong-ass East 6000 glue Mod Podge paintbrush and a pair of scissors you already know how I get down I got rhinestones and flatback pearls to decorate I went to Michael's craft store and found the most beautiful pastel paper with little specks of glitter in it and I'm using rose aqua and lilac I printed out a ton of really cute aesthetic photos I found on Pinterest and then cut out the ones that matched my pastel theme dope let's get started taking the pink glitter paper I'm lining up my lighter to see exactly how much to cut so it'll wrap nicely around the lighter and then just cutting it on out now I'm placing the lighter against the paper and rolling them together so the paper can hold the shape of the lighter make sure you have a perfect fit just keep messing around with it so you feel like you got it now I'm just taping down one edge to the lighter using my e6000 glue I'm smearing it all over the inside then closing it up and holding it tightly until the glue dries yes now it's time to decorate so I wanted this pink one to look kind of like a magical wand so I'm just focusing on just a straight line going up of cabouchins that I created out of polymer clay and using some blingy rhinestones at the base of the wand we got a flower inspired by the flower of life a tiny rhinestone followed by the progression of bigger rhinestones two hearts to symbolize the great power and force of love and topping it all off with my symbol of enlightenment a marijuana leaf a looking pretty nice donut next I'm adding a border of these rose-pink flatback curls to the top and bottom of this magical lighter using my e6000 glue to transfer and pick up the pearls I'm using a piece of polymer clay that I stuck to the bottom of a paintbrush this makes everything way easier this project does take some time but I find creating so much fun and relaxing let me know down in the comments if you make one of your own and what it looks like or you could just tag me on instagram at a local tone and I would love to see it I really want to see if you guys make one of these because they're so easy and fun to do so you should definitely make one and lastly to add a few more embellishments I'm placing silver hot pink and Rose flat back rhinestones to the empty spaces using some super glue just look how majestic it came out I adore this one too much it's so beautiful so pink alright let's get started on the baby blue lighter looking through the pictures that I printed out earlier I found a few tiny blue bears so now I'm just gonna cut them all out the pictures I cut out are some Care Bears a little sad bear that's hanging and a black and blue heart that says baby just the cutest and now to follow the steps as my previous lighter I am measuring and then cutting rolling and fold in cutting some more roll in some more taping now gluing bolden and roll in and lastly securing Hellyeah super simple next up I'm laying down the border of my baby blue pearls wrapping them around the top and the base of the lighter with each of these lighters I didn't really have an ideal plan or an outcome I just kind of flowed from each step to the next you know I just started with the color like hey I'm gonna make a pink one a blue one a purple one print it out some pictures that I like and just started flowing from everything like it's more exciting to see what will happen next and they always end up turning out great so just kind of plan it out a little bit but then let it flow to you if that makes any sense now that the border is done I am gluing down this super a huge big blue heart it's so cute followed by a baby blue bow now I'm busting out the Mod Podge and the photos I cut out from earlier I'm painting the area where I want to place the image and then adding it on top of the tacky area to secure it I'm adding a layer of Mod Podge on top of the image to continuing this process for all of the tiny little images I have and lastly I'm adding on the most gorgeous dark blue light blue and silver rhinestones check it out here's the finished product came out so adorable and now on to the purple lighter so I've seen the images like this all over Pinterest Tumblr Instagram and I fell in love with these images of girls crying because let me tell ya a  can relate so to transform all the pain in my heart and making something beautiful out of it and that's kind of how the inspiration for the slider came up gucchi the first step is gluing down the lilac pearls around the top of a lighter and then coating the back of the image with Mod Podge then placing it nicely onto the lighter securing and sealing the image with more Mod Podge I want this to look smooth and really put together so I'm just going to coat the whole entire lighter once it's completely dry I'm adding in the bottom strip of the lilac pearls the last step is adding in black dark purple lilac and silver rhinestones and look at that we're all done though honestly this lilac one turned out to be my favorite and I take it with me everywhere the Mod Podge keeps the images looking really pretty and they still look good after many uses and also being buried at the bottom of my backpack these are perfect for you know to a kickback and smoke a blunt to or to take with you to any show any festival and be the latest they're promised you there you have it super easy and very simple to make let me know if you make one tag me on instagram at a local tone also be sure to ring the bell for more videos like this one subscribe to my channel and I'll see you guys in my next DIY do", "b2yHp8L0nWI": "hello still don't have an intro it does not matter this is the best thing I guess okay this chair is going to keep like giving this not if you hold still I'm liking also I'm not really sure what we're doing any I know what we're doing but we are very vague plan for this video and I kind of left it up to you to you know well you told me what you're under comm come out right so I have some notes good because I don't that seems to be a Gen X versus millennial thing we like to be prepared I'm prepared but I'm not you're the one that is relaying the information on Marlo or no today's video is about the whitelighter theory a-alright scared this came up because how it was all few offices lighter and I saw it in the kitchen one night on the floor and I came upstairs and I was like hey I found you later and he was like okay give it to me and I was like no I found fish stop staring on the floor on the floor and he was like you didn't pick it up and like give it like why didn't you pick it up and I was like it's a whitelighter well there you said whitelighter I'm like and yeah yeah you don't know about the whitelighter there's only a light if you pick it up you touch a whitelighter you're gonna die 527 or it is 20 years ago for me it was just bad luck yeah whitelighters are supposedly bad luck I just like to say that if you have a whitelighter you're letting kids a death sentence but that's just me he immediately becomes just you shadow over the idea and your size it really well perspective what you do with any theory for the most part a lot more airing favor of it no I look in the [ __ ] right before I don't know English and II told it was because it's ridiculous so he told me he's gonna do his research yeah it took me three minutes so [ __ ] should I say what this thingy I don't know what the theory is yes where's the theory for those who don't know well first the first suppose degrees and this is so stupid the first supposed reason that whitelighters this is before the 27 club comes in right the first reason that white letters are supposed to be bad luck is they say they say the Illuminati when they say that when dick lighters were first introduced they only came in white and black and people would use their lighter to pack their bowl right and a whitelighter would get suit and residue and stuff on the bottom of it so this the reason that they're bad luck is that then when you're when when people would get hassled tassels man by the spider succulent eggs and they would be searched their whitelighter would have lacerating residue and stuff on the bottom of it and then the cops knew they were burning that but a black one wouldn't show which is [ __ ] ridiculous because black plastic and ash are not the same shape and the bottoms have always been white so it makes sure that's true and if that doesn't have anything to do with bad luck that has to do with being stupid or high so but the main reason is the one that you were speaking of is the 27 club 27 club is made up of four individuals all rock musicians I thought more than four only four as far as my three minutes of research I ain't told me which is all with [ __ ] trust me Janis Joplin Jimi Hendrix Jim Morrison and Kurt Cobain okay does everybody know these with these people you know okay who's Jim worship of Courtney Milad okay so they were all rock stars they all had drug problems they were all left hand and they all died at 27 and the most important part is that they were all supposedly found with a white leg lighter in their pocket okay first things first that each you bring big letters are rocking gold feet a thing that's a little bit dim monster do justice I'm along with rock cuz he's like first things first rate did you say for the first Oh then you just took it from there you go I don't know that song anyway walk when you Nicki Minaj he all know I never making us Megan I know that making the NAS is no but we have you seen that video tall enough it's this little girl and like she's writing on a like a whiteboard or something and she's spelling out Nicki Minaj but she spelled Nicki Minaj I hate to the end good evening you give me nice so the bic lighter these Gabi's the fact that he still has it also as another you want to hold it yeah can you dudududududududududu and just seal your fate it's fine then burn your hand or anything no it's just a non-party illuminati says he that's why we can touch that and be for me yeah that's all I have to wear my hair a little long because we have our Illuminati tattoos on the back of our neck is that a thing it just came to me so I said if you know King oven problem yes and Oh God all right so the big lighter was introduced in 1973 really okay yes that's when the first ones came out so that throws three of the four into the sub in right off the bat because let me make sure you get my numbers right here Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin died in 1970 and Jim Morrison died in 1971 wait okay okay big lighters didn't even talking exist when they died hey hop now sure there is there was a disposable lighter that came out in the 60s called the cricket they still had crickets for a long time but it was only available in France small mm-hmm and it wasn't available in the United States until 1972 so even if it was the cricket disposable lighter which looked totally different than a bit it still wasn't available in the u.s. until after all three of them had died mm-hmm however the theorists might say Jim Morrison lived in France well and he died in France mm-hmm but the chances of him having his a rock star disposable lighters were not what people used well you wouldn't mean that he's being humble though is that what it is every [ __ ] fan Jim Morrison is a least humble person on the planet ah so it is somewhat possible that he had a cricket lighter and that he possessed a cricket light is the one however it's absolutely impossible for it to have been in his pocket why because he was [ __ ] naked in a bathtub when he died I okay why would people make that up but I'm not saying I'm not saying that this is wrong I'm just shading like that so I can think of so many reasons like that's so random falaya well I a lot of my yes honestly my guess is it didn't start as a lie it started as okay as far as I know the the other parts of the 27 club were true they're all 27 they're all left-handed I mean left-handed people tend to be more artistic and creative and stuff like that it's because of the way your but I'm not and so as far as I know those things are all true right and this is just me speculating at this point but and the bic lighter the whitelighters are bad luck saying was already sort of simmering and fermenting and whatnot so some stone dude or chick at some point probably no you know people are dude what is uh-huh mean what if all the time silent club is or if they all had white big lighters and that's why they all [ __ ] died at 27 I bet that's what happened at that and then you know they're talking to each other ah then the next day they're hanging out with their friends is like you guys you figured it out [ __ ] you boys right here and they tell two people and they tell two people and the next thing you know is everywhere best time should start and that's what I think happened but there's more okay I just apparently there with autopsies and like there was white lighters in the Alka I don't know Janis Joplin's autopsy is available online and nowhere in it doesn't make any mention of any cigarette lighter whatsoever disposable white or do any of them have a white lighter no okay we haven't talked about Kurt Cobain Ian yeah no because he died in 1994 mm-hmm well after the bit later yes around and the Seattle Police Department 10 20 years after that published photographs from the crime scene they found two lighters neither one of them on his body in his pocket or anything like that but they did find two big lighters and then I've seen the photographs one was in his heroin kit which was a little cigar box was like his spoon and all that crap that one was multicolored it actually looks like because it's flipped over I always peel the labels off of them but you know they have these safety labels on and in the picture it's in the box with the label facing up so all you can sort of see is the edges it looks like it might be one of those ones that has a picture on it and instead of just being a solid color but it's definitely not white and then there's another picture which has like it looks like maybe a backpack or a fanny pack and some sunglasses and a bunch other crap laying on the floor and there's a pink bic lighter laying on top of that backpackers whatever this is black thing there's no mistaking what color the lighter is because it's sitting on a black background yeah so maybe multicolored and pink lighters bad luck once nobody had one in their pocket they didn't exist when the first three died we have photographic evidence the Kurt Cobain didn't have one the spot more do you people want oh yeah another thing is there have been sort of life history biographies all of that kind of stuff several of them written about each one of these people yeah and none of them mention this lighter thing mmm the only place you ever find any of this stuff about the white lighter is in stories involves an article and that are talking about the conspiracy and about the white letters being bad luck so the bucket busted man well next time on conspiracy theory busters we're going to debunk there are a few that I'm sort of like looks like it's got some evidence and what do you mean there's a few that you think computer literacy series that I know I I believe it's not a majority alone here's my thing with a lot of conspiracy theories right now I spent after I think it was after my shoulder surgery I spent no they didn't do funny I use my left arm at all right no no but that's when all of you 9/11 conspiracies were coming out there are movies and all this kind of stuff and most of what I got out of that was like I'm not sure I'm not saying I by these theories necessarily but something that's explained yeah you know it's like I'm doing lightning on the next one I guess did you see that movie now dude there's a [ __ ] left as a documentary on Netflix that I mean I've been hearing that the moon landing was staged the moon landings were stage since I was a kid there was a movie that came out when I was a kid called Capricorn one me and and it was it was about how they staged and put it was fictional it was a just a movie and everything is the most ridiculous thing ever and I always thought packable [ __ ] yeah and the weird thing oddly enough it seems so weird to me we don't have a telescope on earth powerful enough to see close enough to the surface of the Moon we left all kinds of [ __ ] up there the lunar buggies and the legs for the lunar modules and all of that kind of there's tons of [ __ ] that supposedly Flags all yeah but none of our telescopes are powerful enough to see close enough yeah suppose yeah but I see this documentary in a Netflix looking scrolling scrolling scrolling and I can't find anything so like I'll see what these crackpots have to say and the next thing I know I'm watching this thing like fit in my little good book no [ __ ] way man and if I watched it twice hmm and some of that [ __ ] is like yeah [ __ ] fishes help is one of the theories that these guys have is that this is part of the reason why area 51 is so secret because they actually shot some of the film in men areas in London over the desert and you know I think I was in change video I'm not on your lecture but he did a whole video on the conspiracy theories I'm like hey it's pretty crazy we should do we should I do it how long are we doing the landing know everybody know what I'm saying is we should I'm just saying in general we should do more videos with conspiracy theories I think that's a great idea I'm getting ready from let me know in the comments yeah cuz I think that would actually be really good I think it would be fun the thing is I'm gonna [ __ ] on most of them what well yeah I got a respect Mart because I mean this whole can drill things ah yes it's so ridiculous there's so many great things that you can do and I'm I'm trying to be consistent about doing this more often I do understand though when certain things that it's something you're emotional about or something like that you're like I [ __ ] know it and you just want to share it right no it's like those are the ones that you should really fact

we have come so I'll be able to do the comparison videos to survive your lighters now but um these are quite cheap that are talked about tour jet little jet lighters and they're kind of big style lighters that are not disposable and they were free pounds 65 for the 5 on Amazon so 73 pencil lighter which is pretty cheap they're just standard refillable you tane lighters as you can see there you turn them up that way to measure how much is left in there is the bottom see-through and then it's a standard lighter what's good about these is as you just leave it on the front there so you can put it high or low again by constantly ever jet light is on the front well I think to mess about at the bottom which is what I like I don't like having to put a screwdriver in the bottom or a coin to adjust flame or later so you hold this back to the ignite yet see the jet there pretty decent jet sometimes they go redder and then sometimes it stays blue just quite red there here a little bit cap seeping out for a moment open and close it it's fine saying you can't expect massively good construction quality on them a little light like this when you're paying 70 free pencil lighter but before they'd be quite good to try out so yeah I don't know if they how quickly they burn free fluid yet because I haven't tested that they rattle a bit when you shake them I don't know what that is exactly some of them in the pack seem to ignite better than the others I found so far the red one wasn't quite as good see if it like is a bit first time this one okay so that's the flame on high if I play it low that's the flames it's much smaller and if you had it about medium it would be like that that was about high I put it on medium would be like this and then high yeah so can't believe on four five of these for 73 pence each three pounds sixty-five of the five set on Amazon you can get them on eBay as well if you buy them an even bigger bulk and five they are cheaper and they are refillable so I think if you buy them in bulk sat 25 lighters at once they work out about I think it was about 50 to 60 cents each so we'll be testing these against any other jet lighters on petrol lighters and see which is the best but so same for the price you really can't go wrong with these and I do like jet lighters because they're pretty cool they get very hot and you can like what you want to light much quicker and they have better wind proofing them say normal soft flame butane lighter so those the tour jet lighters and yeah pretty good price for them so let's see you know how good they are when I test them very shortly", "GGVHOuNKo4Q": "how you doing world so catfish cooler here coming in with another life lesson this latter stayed in the house yesterday this lighter stayed outside right off

them yo big goes to class yeah", "rK7zf9Foq84": "hey everybody backpack hack here coming at you with another trail tip and i think anybody who's going to start a fire starting kit is going to gravitate towards one of these a bic lighter they're small enough they're light enough they're cheap enough and they're just dependable enough to be included in any fire starting kit however they're not 100 reliable they are not fool proof there are some design issues of these straight out of the box so they're not going to be 100 percent fool proof and you will always get a fire started with one of these however there are some modifications we can make to this to make it more reliable and we're going to turn that into a full-blown what i call a survival lighter we're going to do some modification now understand we're going to be defeating some of the safety features of these lighters so i'm not going to be responsible for anything that happens if you try to decide to do this i've got some ideas that i'm going to throw at you here in this video and if you want to do them one at a time or you don't want to do all of them that's fine but if you want to turn this into this and have it more reliable and more durable than and more useful to you in a survival or camping or backpacking situation let's get started to begin with make sure you buy bright easily spotted colors stay away from earth tones green tan brown black and especially camo red orange and yellow are your best options you want that lighter to be as visible as possible as if you drop it you want it to stand out as much as you can for example can you see this lighter do you see the other lighter yes there's two lighters there pause the video and see if you can spot the other one bright bulb colors are your friends here the first thing i do is remove the warning label i know it's on there because stupid people have done stupid things with these devices but i don't plan on doing anything stupid with it and besides i don't live in california so holding the lighter won't give me cancer now sometimes the labels peel right off other times you will have to resort to stronger measures to get the remaining adhesive off goof off or goo gone whatever you want to use just get all that adhesive off next i'm going to remove the child safety device this is installed to keep small kids from being able to create a spark i take this off just so it's one less thing between me and a fire to go wrong it also helps if you're using the lighter wearing gloves makes it a lot easier to spin that fire wheel to create a spark just use a small screwdriver or an awl or something small and sharp pry it out and it may pop off and fly out somewhere but take that thing out of there my next step is to put a cord loop on the bottom i start out by scoring the bottom of the lighter several times with the point of a knife then rough it up with some sandpaper i then take a scrap of paracord pull out one of the internal strands and cut it to length now you can use bank line for this as well but paracord as a whole is going to be too big mixing up some two-part epoxy i spread it around the bottom of the lighter i then embed the ends of the cord into the epoxy after smoothing it out as the epoxy cures i end up with a nice loop of cord around the bottom of the lighter this is handy to hang the lighter on a necklace or on the key clip inside of a backpack duct tape has many uses in the field and it's an age-old trick to put some wraps of duct tape around water bottles flashlights and yes even lighters if you're going to do this use quality duct tape not the cheap stuff you don't want the adhesive getting all gooey on you over time i rip a bit of it off lengthwise so i don't cover all that bright color that i want and usually a foot or so is more than enough and finally the last step the possibility that the handle on the fork could accidentally be depressed while in your pocket or pack and allowing all the fuel to escape this will render the lighter incapable of producing a flame now most people use zip ties for this but not just any zip tie will work most are far too large while they can be wrapped around the lighter there will be nothing to keep them from sliding off nor can they be dependent on to prevent the valve handle from being pushed down you need a small zip tie one small enough to fit between the bottom of the handle and the body of the lighter now once this is installed the width of the zip tie nested between the fork handle and the body will prevent the fork handle from being depressed now i have two big issues with using a zip tie one is that most people simply cut off the excess do not do this it creates a sharp edge and this sharp edge can be just like a good knife it can rip your clothing tear into your gear and even open your skin so instead of cutting it twist the excess off and eliminate the possibility of injury remember in any back country or survival situation even a seemingly insignificant wound should be taken seriously twisting the excess off is a far better option my other issue with zip ties is you basically need a tool to remove it if you've installed it properly you either need the needle nose pliers of your survival tool or a knife yes you should have both of these with you at all time but i prefer a simple wire tie it performs the same function and can be installed and removed easily by hand without the need for any tool so when it comes time to deploy the lighter i don't have to rely on my survival tool or my knife to access the flame in my lighter and there you have it how you turn a regular off-the-shelf bic lighter into a true survival lighter so this is a backpack hat coming at you with a trail tip be sure to like subscribe share and comment on my videos ring that bell so you know i'm getting new videos out be safe out there and i'll see you out on the trail", "Q2sOcWdYILM": "I decided to take some time to make a video and show off some vintage lighters in my cigarette lighter collection these are all lighters that I've purchased over the years I started collecting back in was 1997 they're about being 2020 now that's 23 years of cigarette lighter collecting started buying them I actually kind of by accident I was have a little junk shop in Cambridge Massachusetts and there was an old lighter that caught my eye I never really seen anything like it so I bought it for probably 5 bucks and took it home took it apart cleaned it up got it working I was impressed by the craftsmanship of this old lighter and the mechanics of it and it was kind of cool to get it get it going again so I scoured local antique shops and flea markets and would buy them where I saw him and take him take him apart cleaned him up and get him working again around that time eBay became popular and back then it was easy to buy large quantities of inexpensive lighters on eBay and it got to the point where I was buying them faster than I can fix them up so I started putting them in cases and just adding to the collection I'm gonna go through these cases and talk about a few that are interesting to me and I hope you find this video interesting as well and I promise you a surprise at the end so this lighter here is ronson standard it was actually the first lighter I got and inspired me to start collecting lighters when I purchased it from a little drunk shop in Cambridge it actually was covered in black enamel but it was mostly scratched off in the center and in the back you might be able to see where it's a little scuff there but underneath the lacquer was shiny chrome and this is being the first one inspired me to keep going all different types of lighters here's a little promotional piece for planter's peanuts I thought it was kind of cool to have a little pan with the lighter this is a newer one a butane lighter probably from the probably from the late 80s this is just the box it's in there it looks just like that Ronson was one of the major lighter manufacturers they came out with a line of table models this one is one of the more popular ones also one of the more common ones it's around some crown has some silver plating on it they made these in all different shapes here's another one called the Newport for the longest time I had just a king lighter a friend of mine got me the matching Queen here's another Ronson table model called the Leone I was some enamel on it washers with a little built-in clock this is a Dunhill silver-plated lighter it's always interesting to think about the back story one of the things that attracted me to cigarette lighters is that back in the day this was something that people carried with them just about everywhere they went they're lighter you know it was kind of a personal statement this one I imagine was you know given to a fiance and it says you know I do do you just a nice little sentiment this is some one of the earlier lighters of my collection a gift from my dad silver plated with a silver sterling silver embossing on a German lighter this is a semi-automatic style lighter which means that one movement lights it and another movement puts the flame out this style of course being the most popular with collectors another example of of the scene here little advertising lighters actually this one does not have advertising on it but a lot of times they would put some some logo on the top this is one of my favorite styles of lighters it's an aluminum lighter from the 50s it is actually two individual cigarette lighters attached in the center has a little screw off cap a flint wheel a filler cap and it's two independent lighters so when one side uses up all the fuel you've got a backup right there this particular one was made in two different styles one with the screw off cap and one with a lift off cap it's amazing that these things didn't get lost here are some lighters that have built-in flashlights this one actually uses a battery to create heat to light the wick this one of course a more traditional flint wheel interesting figural table lighters this little guy lifts up his arm to expose his wick which was actually burnt off so he can be replaced there and then the flint wheel on his backside would shower sparks kind of a funny design idea another lighter with a silver wrap this is a French model some side press lighters different embossed designs a lot of times you would find these with advertising on them as well so you can see the design on the kit we'll pick it up this is a very early Ronson Ronson standard has a cool design where there's a little hook that catches the Flint wheel to pull it forward striking the Flint little mini gun lighter I put these two together because I thought it was interesting this is a very very you know early primitive lighter made out of steel with brass on the end and then you know the technology has changed so much over the years that now we have plasma arc lighters I'm sure you guys have seen these not really part of the collection just gear for perspective moving on to the second display case this has more of my favorite style of lighter like the other one that was to individual lighters this one is one central wick or the cap that screws off or kept that I think this one pulls out and two independent Flint wheels I like the redundancy of this this was a military lighter made in the 40s with surplus aluminum from the aircraft industry it's got a symbol on it I believe this was US troops stationed in Austria this is one of the finer examples I've got another one you can see the emblem is a little chipped up these caps always get lost and it's a little more weathered this one I'm not surprised that somebody took good care of it it's engraved in the back from ENC December 25th 1945 so you know most likely a Christmas gift from one troop to another another style of that lighter with the two Flint's this one has some engraving that I can't read but it it is dated 1943 you can read that post a comment if you know what that means but again this one has the cap that unscrews and then the two flint wheels this is an interesting lighter in terms of the mechanism the tap opens and then the flint wheel strikes horizontally needs a replacement wick no big deal another interesting style pulldown I'm a little lever on the side this has some advertising on it this is a German made lighter this one here has a wheel that allows you to do some early flight calculations gun lighter and then early lift arm lighters this was a early Evans the silver plate or nickel-plated hammered finish here in this third case I've got another example of different styles of lighters this would be a considered a lady's purse lighter and whether ladies lighter with mother-of-pearl on and Evans by day this one was this is a sterling silver lighter from Ronson called the Adonis and it was engraved G C 1948 AM 100 club which I believe was a way to support soldiers and service members who were killed in line of duty so this obviously you know meant something to somebody I have another one of these that has it's almost like thank you for 25 years of service this later is a side squeeze lighter that has a trapdoor it's called the Colby lighter I think being Cosby Crosby promoted this lighter or he had ownership in the company at one point this was gold-plated now it's just you know basically it's raw brass made by Park Sherman lift arm lighter an example of military trench art this one you know has a brass bolt probably from some armament and some looks like a halfpenny and another foreign coin which is this is dated yeah 1944 so from the war effort and a gold-plated Dunhill lighter this is a newer lighter I think this was a graduation present for my father another lighter with a clock in it I like this one because when you strike the lighter it winds the watch this is another example of a semi-automatic lighter this one made by thorns you would unscrew this little button in the front press it to strike the lighter swiss-made another early lift arm Ladera looks to be handmade no maker's marks this one I thought was interesting this is from an Evans case lighter but somebody actually cut the case off you can see where they cut it off down here and then they turned it into a pocket lighter kind of a cool effect these are some Mexican silver left arm lighters another example of a trench lighter here this one was made by Bowers when you open up the lighter it pulls back this tougher cap and creates a built-in windscreen good for use in the trenches and then it has a chain where you can hang it from your watch this is these are some novelty lighters a little stop sign when the battery was working you would light the lighter and it would cycle through the three colors and stop on a random one each time which I thought was interesting my mom got this for me I think from like a gas station in Florida she thought it was interesting and that's um that's kind of a cross-section of my cigarette lighter collection I do have some that didn't fit in these display cases and for a little surprise I'll show those off now so I struggled with displaying lighters versus storing lighters and I had been looking for some wooden flat files and a colleague of mine turned me on to this set which was posted on Craigslist which I bought for basically no money and put some of the overflow lighters in here now it's not completely filled but I'll show off some of the ones that are in here one of the ways that I learned about different cigarette lighters to look for was through older lighter books and I created a little cigarette lighter book library here is a great resource a lot of these call themselves price guides I'd say eBay is really the best way to determine the current real world market value of any cigarette lighter because that's the most anyone's willing to pay for it right there that being said this is these books are a great resource to learn about the history of cigarette lighters this one in particular this one was one of my first lighter books and you can see on the back this double aluminum cigarette lighter which is what inspired me to go actively search for those this is a great book in terms of the different examples of cigarette lighters this one it's it's not really a resource for information but it does have great pictures the Zippo book here obviously you know it's a great resource for Zippo lighter collectors I don't consider myself a Zippo lighter collector per se that being said you know I do have some so this is the lighter infirmary where letters that are missing pieces are they go here until I can repair them but the collection starts here these are all music box lighters when you like when you strike them some of them are overwhelmed so you find a good example they play this horrible little tune kind of a haunted house type thing some additional lighters with watches built in other lift arm lighters these are all made by Evans women's ladies lighters here some you know different advertising here this was a for a bowling league these are German lighters military lighters rope lighters that were used in the trenches where you wouldn't flame to give away your position these would just glow red hot enough to light your cigarette and then you'd snuff it out with a little ball and chain there some more examples of early sort of primitive style lighters these are B D jet lighters up here they were good for lighting your pipe this little brass tube here has the other end of the wick in it and when you turned it sideways it would heat up that tube the fuel inside would explode shoot out a little pinhole and come right down these are all Ronson whirlwind they have a little pop up winning there when you need it these are all aluminum lighters mostly from the 50s also made from surplus aluminum from the aircraft industry another one of those double aluminum lighters and a lighter that has one flint wheel but two wicks in there maybe that would be better for lighting a cigar these are all Ronson standard lighters runs and princess lighters knockoff Ronson standard style lighters this is some more one-off lighters these are Ronson's these are all different semi-automatic lighters and other Thorens this is a Nassau lighter prized by collectors another push button very early this one's dated 1911 most of these lighters I've purchased at flea markets for about five bucks apiece on average I consider myself an amateur lighter collector mainly because you know I don't really have the time or resources to buy some of the museum quality pieces that being said there are some sort of unique ones in here this one looks like a Zippo but when you open it up it has a little side press to light the wick from interesting novelty lighters this one is a belt buckle but the front comes off and you can slide it up to light like your cigarette and kind of an interesting discreet way to carry a cigarette lighter one that has a roulette wheel Oh camera this one's interesting because it's solar-powered the parabolic mirror when you pointed a full sunlight actually creates enough heat to let your cigarette and it works pretty quick depending on how much Sun you have another example of that double Flint wheel lighter this one's a little bit smaller these are interesting ronson pencil lighters usually when you find these they were you know mint in the box because a lot of times a cigarette lighter was given as a gift this you know makes a great gift but it wasn't very practical so people kind of kept them in the box and and didn't really use them very much a little striker lighters this was a display case another style of pipe lighter you would open it up strike it and then you could draw the fly down play your pipe these are interesting because they have a measuring tape built-in maybe not the most practical well I don't actively collect suppose they do sort of come across my path and I buy them when the price is right probably haven't spent more than $15 on any of these one in particular is sterling silver Zippo from the 1950s this was I believe owned by well this this was owned by Richard K Mellon who I believe is the heir to the Carnegie Mellon banking institution and I looked it up based on the year that this came out he was from Pittsburg Zippos R as well I believe that this was his cigarette lighter so historically a significant piece World War two black crackle lighter all surprised by Zippo collectors I actually bought both I bought this for 10 bucks and this for $15 typically I'm not really going to talk about the value of cigarette lighters because you know it's just comes down to you know who's willing to pay for it but I got these at a flea market on Cape Cod in the same day from two different sellers so kind of a good a good day for picking up like there's um this one is a leather covered Zippo lighter new in the box so that is fairly collectible this one here is made out of copper was I think it was only released in 2003 and solid coppers have collectors like those this is an early one from I believe from the 40s it's a three barrel hinge Zippo and they call this the tall case made out of nickel silver and you know it has a different hole pattern and the Flint wheel has straight teeth versus the kind of the diamond-cut teeth these are all knockoff Zippos over here flat advertising lighters small you know small format lighters these are side press lighters script Oh view lighters they have different advertising these are actually little tiny cigarette lighter cufflinks that my brother got me for my wedding these are all butane lighters novelty butane lighters and some older butane lighters which I don't actively collect but like I said they just sort of come across my path and some of these are funny you know a Hello Kitty cigarette lighter a little typewriter these are more table lighters case lighters I think I showed you an example of one where somebody cut the case off of the cigarette lighter just retaining this top the lighter portion of it more of those silver-plated Ronson lighters some large-format come in novelty cigarette lighters there's more examples of table lighters I don't have time to go through all of these let me know if there's anything that you see that you want me to talk more about if you want to post a comment this is actually my first youtube video so I'm still trying to get the format down more examples of table lighters down here these were more novelty ones this one you know you'll wind it up and he walks and just some overflow down here when I got these flat files they were just bare on the inside I put some green felt because I thought it would look nice but that is that's my vintage lighter collection hope you like it", "xABFyZzU7Dg": "hey guys it's Joe modern and survival since I'm here with a little tip video for you guys today wait what is this a bit lighter what in the world could I teach you about bic lighters well it's not that fantastic of a tip however is it is very useful if you have a fire kit or you like playing with fire or you need lighters for other means you know that these bic lighters work very well however they do have one major flaw and that's that piece of junk see that right there child safety device what a bunch of nonsense anyone who remembers a time before those things knows that these lighters could work very well well with that it just becomes a hindrance sure you can light it up but it takes a lot more pressure and eventually your thumb you'll start to feel it so oh and on the matter of the child safety feature children are smart enough to get around that if you can do this so can they so let's get rid of that and make this a lot easier like I said it may not seem like a big deal but imagine this you're sitting out in the woods it's pretty cold you know let's just say 30s and 40s your hands are cold you're trying to get a fire started you've decided you're not going to go with the Ferro rod you're going to use your bic lighter to get one started faster but now you get that child safety feature that's messing with your hands it's your hands aren't going to be able to maneuver quite as well in the cold so by removing this it's going to make this slider perform a lot easier alright the tool of the day to do this is pretty much anything that works as a prying device in this segment I'm going to use a Leatherman kick that I have with me I'm going to use the small screwdriver now anytime your your prying this you want to go really slow because first of all you don't want to damage you know the tool that you're using unless whatever you're using it doesn't matter like if you're using a nail per se another thing is you want to make sure that this is pointed away from you because it is going to go flying now you probably okay so you take the edge and you put it in the side and you pry it very slowly and as you see it's going to pull up just like so and as you're pulling up then you can move it in further and further and continue to pry up and I'm going to try to keep it from flying off no almost however this time I actually thought maybe there we go so now we have a Bic lighter - the child safety device and child safety device is right there isn't that nifty so what do we get instead now you got the trusty bic lighter that works very well and now it starts very very easy and there's no fatigue on your finger at all lighting it this way and now we're playing with fire alright guys well I hope you enjoyed this video and I hope you found it useful if you did give me

back to top Tuesday no Oh Tuesday today is one that I have been getting requests for for at least two and a half years now and that is the whitelighter theory and the 27 club theory these are both theories I don't know if they're true so I did some research and we are going to explore them today and see if there's anything to this if you guys like these types of videos where I look at conspiracies and kind of you know give my opinion on them decide if I think there's any accuracy there but before we get into that I'm one to let you guys know that we are doing another month giveaway

check it out but let's get into this y'all but did thinking caps on so what is the 27 club and who is in this club well the 27 club is a basically a list of celebrities and musicians who have died extremely young at age 27 normally their deaths came from their lifestyle obviously when you're a celebrity Hollywood musician world there's a lot of drugs and alcohol involved and sadly and most of those people kind of got into that there are some that are suicides homicide or like freak accidents the first one is Robert Johnson he was born in 1911 and died on August 16th of 1938 and he was considered to be the first person who joined at the 27 club he was an American blues singer and songwriter and he was murdered he actually drink poison so that sucks and then in 1969 in the span of two years so until 1971 for major musicians died at age 27 the first being of Brian Jones who is the founder of the roll Jones and he died on July 3rd of 1969 he actually drowned in a pool in his house of course the famous Jimi Hendrix he died on September 18th of 1970 the Jimi Hendrix Experience is over the acid rock musician died today in a London hospital apparently from an overdose of drugs during his short career and Rick's play of his electric guitar into some of the most unusual sounds of an unusual music and he sadly overdose on barbiturates and choked on his own vomit he was 27 then Janis Joplin and she died on October 4th of 1970 and she died sadly from a heroin overdose at age 27 what's kind of an interesting thing to note about her death is that her manager actually believed she was given like too strong of heroin like not that you should be taking heroin at all but she normally was fine with the amount that she was taking and whatever drug dealer gave her this they had several other clients that died that week too so it's possible it was a higher dose and she thought she was taking apparently then Jim Morrison of the doors and he died on July 3rd of 1971 so the same day as Bryan Jones he was found by his wife Pamela Courson in the bathroom of his Paris apartment and the official cause of death was listed as heart failure now there are over 60 members to the 27 club why the most well-known from our age group would be Amy Winehouse and now word out of London confirmation that multiple Grammy award-winning singer-songwriter Amy Winehouse is dead police in London today responded to a call about a woman found deceased at the singers apartment Winehouse was declared dead at the scene her personal assistant Alex Haynes claims that Amy told him that she reckons she would soon be joining the 27 club of rock stars who died at that age she had a feeling that she was gonna die young when she was found her blood alcohol content was 0.416 percent at the time of her death so that is more than five times the legal limit and there were many more including Kurt Cobain Kurt Cobain was the lead singer of the group Nirvana their albums were bestsellers their songs filled with images of despair and viola one lyric the Sun is gone but I have a light the day is done but I'm having fun and then this morning his body found at home another casualty of success Alan Wilson Dave Alexander Pete ham Chris Bell so obviously many people think it's more than just a coincidence that these people died at the age of 27 and there are several different theories about how the club was created some people think that the 27 club is all celebrities and musicians who have basically sold their soul for fame that they knew that they would die at 27 and they made a deal with the devil for fame and fortune during those 27 years and the first person would be Robert Johnson the legend had it that Johnson had no talent at guitar but was determined to achieve success so one night a voice told him to visit the crossroads by doc reason Tatian at midnight he was met by a large black man who apparently told him he was the devil in disguise the big man took the guitar from Johnson tuned it the devil offered him the guitar in exchange for his soul and Robert Johnson returned to the plantation with the magic guitar and became a blues master overnight so obviously chances are that's not true but could be and yeah I want to know what you guys think about that one but yeah there's no like source that this happened and we don't have proof that he'd sucked before like yeah so kind of hard to really believe that one and then obviously people have thought about the number 27 as far as numerology goes which numerology is very interesting to me it's not something that I like really believed in but it's not something that I think it's [ __ ] either I kind of feel like mixed about it and I'm just very intrigued by it honestly I just don't know enough do you really have an opinion on it but but basically the number 27 reduces to 9 which is the number of regeneration and death then there's a theory about drug decay obviously when you take drugs for a long time and a lot of people have been on these since their late teens or early 20s and as you take drugs for a while you build up a tolerance so people start upping their doses to get the same high that they got originally mixed with being older that their body is now aged to age 27 and then there's psychologist and psychoanalyst Erik Erikson he actually invented something called the eight stages of physical development it's basically trapped human life from age zero to age 65 according to the theory there are eight stages in one's life you pass through these stages throughout your life I'll put up a chart of these stages of psychological development so you guys can kind of see the stage six which is age 21 to 39 is intimacy and isolation so people's major question at this time in their life is will I be alone will someone love me this is about the time you take your relationships really seriously and you start to question like planning your life and who you're gonna be with the theory is that people during this time in their life are more susceptible to drinking and abusing drugs because they could be depressed because other people around them might be getting married or finding love and they are lonely now there's one more theory I want to share and this is my own theory because I am where'd you guys know I like to make my own theories I was thinking about it from an astrology point of view and I know not all of you believe in astrology and no pressure if you don't but it's obviously a big part of my life and there's something in astrology called your Saturn return and this happens around age 27 for most people it can't happen 28 or 29 I think even 26 but it's basically when Saturn returns to the same place that it was when you were born kiss seven moves really [ __ ] slow it takes a long time to get back there and at this point of your life you have to learn a life lesson or a major event happens or you're challenged in some way so that's my own personal theory is that maybe these people who are going through their Saturn return but the 27 club to be honest I don't think there's really anything going on Australia's Queensland University conducted a study to see if there was any evidence to show that the 27 club is real him and a total of 1046 musicians who had a number-one album in the UK between the years of 1956 and 2007 and out of 500 22 possible musicians that are in this category only 3 deaths that happened in this period of time and that gives a rate of 0.7 deaths per hundred musician years so I really just proves the theory and the University of Sydney also looked at this and they determined that the highest number of at any age for a musician was actually 56 so this often gets paired with the whitelighter theory now what is that you may have heard it in a song I know Jeezy had it in one of his songs this year it is said that Jim Morrison Jimi Hendrix Janis Joplin and Kurt Cobain all had Bick whitelighters at the time of their death now what I found out is this is impossible Vik didn't even start making whitelighters until 1973 Jim Morrison Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin all died to b4 1973 and Jim Morrison he died in his bathtub so how the [ __ ] would he have a lighter in his pocket makes zero sense Kurt Cobain was the only person who died after the creation of the BIC white lighters and in the reports he did have two lighters on them however neither of them are white you can see pictures of them actually when it comes to this one pals I have to say I don't think there's any truth to it but I could be wrong so I want to hear your opinions do you believe in the 27 club do you think there's anything significant about that age what about the white lighters but I mean there's no proof that any you would even have one so I don't know it's it's kind of just a silly internet theory but let me know what you guys think be sure to give this video a thumbs up if you want to see more kind of debunking videos and I will gladly do that but that is it for me today you guys I hope you're having a great day and I'll see you next time bye [Music]", "7EP_F8sOfFI": "oh yes the good old-fashioned bic lighter there's a reason the classics are classics these lighters are absolutely fantastic they're dirt cheap and get packs of them for just like three or four bucks depending on where you go they're all over the place disposable these butane can't refill them but it's not a big deal because they cost nothing he's throw them in water they can go through the wash they'll still work this went to the wash like four times kept putting in my pocket I kept forgetting it was there it's so good especially for the money you really can't argue that all for that very simple extremely lightweight need a whole bunch of these and stash them all over the place they're in spots in the house maybe different spots in the car keep one in your pocket you'll literally forget you have it on you which again that happened to me many times simple soft flame there is it little like childproof thing right there but you can easily take it off with the screwdriver make it a little bit easier to ignite it there's just something about these that are so magical these lighters are just fantastic and for the price they literally cannot be beaten you have said to something like a Zippo so that we consider more tactical or more cool or whatever any I suppose are cooler than Beck's I think for sure these are wind proof it's extremely difficult to blow them out and you can light them and this sort of sit it there keep the flame there and do whatever you want to do with it but you have to keep refilling them with fuel and they're more expensive granted they're not disposable the fuel will just stay in there will not evaporate and have it for years and will still work years later it's a lighter that cannot be beaten for the money the awesome power of the BIC", "UQM6z3Txfgg": "right we're going to test free of these jet lighters against each other to see which is the best at cutting through an aluminium can so it's not going to be very tough test but we're going to see if the tour jet the prof or the coney lighters the best little jets like a simple bit disposable lighter but with a small jet flame so I think that's going to be the worst the prof is my personal favorite they're also sometimes kony it's mangled blowtorch jet lighter for the fairness sake of the test I'm saying all these light is too high and that has the angled flame and the coney sort of lighter on the right has free flames that are unadjusted ball jets so although that will produce the most heat overall I think the prof having the angled sort of one jet ram which goes higher will be better that will try them in order so I'm going to do is use this one first toward you and I'll get that just where you can see it and so for fairness reasons what I'm going to do is go all along with each one a different height so it's the same thickness everywhere but obviously you all know which one did which so start with the tour jet in a metal creaking now I'm going to stop there and that hasn't managed to get through but you can probably see it singed quite badly I'm consuming on that the UM side so that's definitely made a lot of heat there hasn't got throw in that time period next we're going to try the pro for the Coney angled neck lighter set to high as well so is this one it gets in frame there we go I've set that to honey and we're going to try it just a bit further down yet much faster result to this one horrible fumes coming off and I'll stop that there so that's done more than the top one has in a similar sort time period again that's not cut completely free so that's kind of surprising is actually smoke coming out the top of the cam now whatever is inside is evaporating just quite funny but yeah you've released who have made it through so last we're going to do the co nice or triple flame cigar lighter I'm just going to do that at the bottom there so let's see oh I think we've got a better result yep look that's got molten orange there just pull it away a second yeah that was doing the most I'm just going to zoom in on that bottom section and we'll see if I can get all the way through all right let's try it out again yeah that's cracking we're through so this is by far the best of them actually this does run free free all fruit fuel quickly but it's very efficient at doing it so the winner is for cutting through metal Makoni triple flame cigar lighter but what I'm going to do now that really does smell horrible is um go back to this one and see if I leave it on there a bit longer if we can have any results or this not really the metals massively contracting on there but not you know enough to a cup for it and we know that the tour jets going to have a similar problem where it's just not going to do anything but what I'm going to quickly do is I'm gonna sort of see if I can finish off those holes of this one because we know it works well so pop it on or flick the thing so it stays on then we've got that orange glow and we're cutting through the metal again you look alone stenches horrific but that County's history so yep disco knee triple flame jet lighter makes mint me out of those cans I'd highly recommend one although the fuels gone down a bit more I'd highly recommend one for if you want some serious heat and work from a little pocket-sized lighter you", "LKnw69yD4XU": "Wow baby early morning in Texas and I'm heading to the vet clinic [Music] done at the vet clinic now I need to go to a gun store because I have a gun waiting for me actually to [Music] my day is like half over but I realized I prominently recorded like 1 to 2 minutes of actual footage and you guys have seen so far so the reason that I haven't recorded a whole lot this day is because I think there's gonna be a lot happening the rest of the day our special guest is coming in and I may have already titled this video to where you know who it is but he has 10 million subscribers on YouTube on two different channels he got famous for prank videos and now he daily vlogs and he has over a thousand daily vlog episodes he's really good at it and it's rhomin at whip and he is coming to stay at our house for like three nights I think Roman has been on YouTube for a long time and is really good at YouTube and I am so excited for the chance to actually collab with them to make some videos make some YouTube history almost to the gun store now I'm gonna go in and get my dude guns thanks for being here with me by the way you guys are awesome and you guys have really seemed to like these vlogs which has made them so enjoyable for me to do and it makes it a lot easier for me to communicate with you guys on sort of a more personal level without you know trying to make a demolition ranch video without trying to make a better inch video I can just kind of tell you whatever I need to tell you and it's just a very it's a very intimate kind of video and I love that I can do this with you guys now so thanks for being here for me I'll always be there for you hey good how are you nothing just gonna fill myself on TV up there it's pretty neat that is such a weird design I've no idea how to open it huh I wonder if that means safe D yes it's anxious I Kurt Tanner the gunsmith he speaks German and so he was I was like what is yes he speaks German he's German I know he's German I have a old-style 1911 and then we actually have a legit old Luger nine-millimeter never shot one of these we actually just had to play with it figure out how it even works pretty cool pistol I'm excited to finally own one just got all Mayors working like dog getting this place cleaned up for our guests to come you know they're not even that cool Mary mayor is little OCD is that true mayor's OCD and she likes everything very clean all the time I don't care so much but she really likes things clean when people are coming into town you might see the last clip as I walked through but we have a table in here now look how good with all of its like October decorations on it we actually have a dining room now just super cool I think we did a pretty good job good job mayor everyone always says that mayor's so good at woodworking and I'm like a klutz I taught her everything she knows but the planning is usually mayor and everyone wonders how she's so good at this kind of stuff Mary's actually an engineer she went to school Texas A&M University to be an engineer you went to the library today you went back to school we have about an hour before I need to head out of here and go pick up Roman and Brittany at the airport and I kind of was thinking since Roman is known for prank videos it'd be kind of funny to pull a prank on him even though it's not very smart because he's probably way better pranking it'll probably get me back before the trip is over but I think this be a really funny thing to do so I invited my old friend creepy cooter over that's good bud we're wanting to Surprise them and we were just chatting about where the best place to hide would be maybe it's gonna be dark when we get back so it's gonna be kind of creepy even creepier than creepy cooter normally is maybe like right behind this door I was thinking though maybe you came in the bathroom coop and hid in the shower because when you walk in this bathroom you can't see things this just normal bathroom and everybody always walks in and looks over here at the shower and he could be like standing right there which would be pretty freaky what do you think so cooter and I decided the bathroom is the best place so naturally you look around here you may seem in the reflection and that'll scare you pretty good but if you don't you'll walk over here and he'll be staring straight into your soul this is gonna be so good cooter you're cool too wait here for a while it's gonna be probably like three hours okay good luck buddy you got this and Brittany if you're the first one to walk into that room I am oh so sorry its Romans fault Mariners got mom she went to the grocery store to get like snacks and drinks and stuff for the apartment so they have things to munch on while they're here she doesn't know that Cooter's up there so I may actually end up scaring her instead here she comes you are not supposed to be in the house how did you get in the house coast is clear if she did not see him up there even while we're up there putting groceries away now she wants me to vacuum out her car [Music] there's enough goldfish that cookies down here a monster kiss you were supposed to growl bye-bye kick he said bear kiss which is also just growl Romo just texted me said that his plane just landed we're probably normally like ten minutes away from the airport but this traffic's nuts it is five o'clock so we're hitting some good traffic and we're rolling at 20 miles an hour on the interstate yes that's what I'm talking about you know this Wow as I walked through the valley of the shadow of death I take a look at my life and realize there's nothing left cuz I've been blessing and laughed and so long as my things and my mind is going but you're still recording [Music] [Music] we got Brittany and Roman I put my seatbelt on so you guys know yeah good also we need to go eat dinner or and yell I go hungry it's only five hungry little we saw a sign with a giant fast steak on it we're like let's go so we need to go eat dinner but first I have bad news I have bad news

plans I see there I loved it but I was little [Music] I can't work like this", "HxaDI2pB4oM": "what's up Turtles Creek here with blackout outdoors today's video are going to be checking in on an exposure test we're performing on a bit later about a month ago Stoney and I came out here wrote the date on a lighter and sat down the force to be exposed to the elements just to see how you know how well basically this cheap lighter or inexpensive excuse me not cheap lighter will hold up to with the elements during that time it's been snowed on multiple times that snow has since melted it's been raining it's been below freezing above freezing freezing and thawing so all these different you know processes are going on out here so I think it's going to be a really good test to how well this under $2 lighter is gonna hold up and that's pretty much why I choose to carry it in my kits you know in my bags just in general why I specifically choose a Bick is because they're really really quality lighters for the price so we're gonna go find the lighter pick it up see if it still works my money is one it's still going to work and we're gonna you know flick it flick our bake a little bit start a little fire just to show it and you know just leave it back out here and see how you know wears throughout this throughout the winter so I'm gonna go pick it up now got a little log cabin built down here assuming this lighter is going to work actually log cabin I wouldn't hire me if this is how I'm gonna build a log cabin I got a little bit of setup breakdown here I got the lighter in my hand here's the date for those of you watching in Europe in the states it's month/day/year it's the reverse a little bit different probably how you do it in your country but so this is November 11th 2014 and what's the date today so near 13th or 14th of December yeah so it's a little over a month and that's a si first flick if it lights there was some moisture on here holding it wipe that off but we'll see if it lights right away and it does look at that now it's not too cold out today either these still do work in the cold they're very temperamental if it's very cold oh yeah I do is holding your hand and your armpit and like I said we'll be checking back in on this as the months progressed throughout the winter but it's used us to get this little half built teepee or excuse me log cabin inside the boughs the main part is just shredded tulip poplar bark and some mixed in river birch bark and I got a little ball cabin got that off the ground promote airflow really wet conditions today very damp snow just melted for the past two days straight you know this lighter is just really for less than two dollars just a great little piece of equipment to keep in your bag and so far it's done really well so enough talking let's just light something on fire it's down yeah oh she fell on me not to do that again he formed it I'm gonna stay upright for me and there we go really wet wood and that's all there is to it you know obviously if I was trying to make a full-fledge fire I would have kept building this law cabin up had materials on top of it you know continuing to let the fire climb as you can see it worked it worked well enough to work fine just for a little experiment just to show you show you some different techniques of getting fire started and just using the big lighter so I'm really impressed with this I know these work this well but I'm trying to do Stoney and I are just trying to do a little bit more control experiment to how well these will hold up to the elements that's why we're doing this your sort of exposure experiment so we're gonna be keep checking in with in with this specifically I'm gonna put it back to the same exact spot where I had it and we'll check back in with it as the winter progresses but let me know you thought about this video hope you liked it hope was fun shed some light on this little cheap not cheap inexpensive bic later this critic signing out with black outdoors later Turtles", "mJJq-6G0Li0": "hey what's up Turtles Creek here it's that time finally that time checking in on the bic lighter been a year it's been over a year today is November 15th I believe we started this on November 11th of 2014 but that date has since been gone off the lighter for a while now but we're gonna see how it goes there she is or he or it there it is okay that stickers all going off of it no date but it's still here alright before before I like it though I want to sit I want to get my feather stick situated I'm going to try that cascade again I'm gonna remember what what number was one of these check-ins I tried to cascade I'm gonna try to lay here see if it hits this one it's this one we'll see my prop it against his tree pick up the lighter and then just go do it plenty of water on hand too that's in case still haven't touched the lighter yet look at that right up lit right up oh that's not gonna reach him too much wind blowing my aunt wah-wah on a perfect world them all a little spider on that one though no point to sacrifice them just for kicks one of these times that cascades gonna work I'm gonna have the light or the wind on my side I'm now just looking at the lighter when was the last time we even checked in on this it's been once I know it's been months nine months was that the last time maybe I remember there's definitely more rust on it I can see it a little vent right by my index finger right there I don't know if it's picking it up or not were you surprised were you surprised that worked right away what's the temperature day maybe four in the 40s right now stony may be in the 40s high 40s so not really cold so it didn't surprise me that that went right up still sounds super fool not surprised by that either we've already established that this really doesn't get a lot of direct sunlight for this to get super hot and evaporate the fluid light right up the old black pick that could old black pick out in these woods should I write the date on it now should I know I'll remember November 11 2014 today's November 15 2015 it's gonna be a while - this thing stops working I guess I'm in a moment of reflection right now it's been a year since we came out and put this lighter in the woods a year a whole year a trip around the Sun do you know what you're doing any a year ago from now are you happier how much have you learned new relationships I think it's important to reflect a lot on our past and not wait for traumatic or life-changing events just to stop and think about what we've done in our recent past reflect I think I think constant reflection is a good thing so we'll see maybe three months maybe two months not sure we'll check back in on this we've been kind of haphazard ever since six months so we'll see til the next big lighter exposure test this is crap for black out later Turtles", "-xVVIdNMt-0": "okay this video is going to be a test on the BIC lighters to see how well they do in the cold they've been in the freezer for about over six hours so I'm gonna hit the start button and I'm gonna go run in and get the the BIC lighters and then we'll see if they light up and see how much time it takes for them to light up the room temperature in here is probably between 75 and 80 okay so I'm gonna run and get the BIC lighters trip over the lights okay that's the electronic one and it's it's almost empty this is the classic that's almost empty and that one's pretty full so right off the bat you can see some of the ice see there's some ice crystals okay so this one is the one that's almost full you know what I'm gonna shut the lights off well that's unexpected this is the one that's almost full Wow you know some of the stuff I've seen on the web is not matching up with some of my own testing okay this one is I would say about two thirds empty okay so obviously the ones that are more empty don't let me try this one again this is the classic again okay so what I'm seeing is is when you have a Bic lighter that's full it seems to do better in the cold weather okay so you're you can see the flames already gone up from the first strike the very first one we're only two minutes in two and a half minutes into the test I don't think it would warm up I mean you know it's just it just came out of the freezer okay this is the electronic one okay this one is almost empty Wow so okay that's the full one see if we can get this almost empty one two oh no this is the one that's about two thirds empty okay it did light if the the flip must be a little wet from the condensation okay so this one it's about 75 to 80 degrees in this room a-plus I'm handling it so all the ice is melted but look we're still under we're not even four minutes in this one definitely requires some more so the Flint on this one you know it is a little sluggish probably because of the condensation this one's brand new now look at that there's a little at the macro adjust here come on I have a macro setting on this camera but obviously it doesn't want to kick in there it goes so you see a little black on the right above the BIC Oh on the the valve opening here the valve tab I'm wondering if that's Flint part of the Flint because this one's very new I've only struck this one about maybe less than 20 times so the Flint looks like it's gotten onto the same with this one come on macro I liked my other camera better is quicker see there's some more black so when the Flint gets moisture on it it it looks like it breaks down a lot more or or just the Flint no because this one's new so there wouldn't be that much Flint on the on the wheel so that's that's something them you know when it gets waterlogged the flip might get might erode quicker but regardless of that it's under five minutes all these lid and unfortunately I can't give you the temperature of the freezer but it's well under you know the freezing point I think most freezers run about fifteen degrees under freezing so surprisingly this guy has survived the most most of the tests in the water test of course I didn't test these for for water but this one did good on that it lit up right away on the the this cold test the only thing I don't like about the idea of this one is it's got the electronic ignition if that fails you're you're pretty sunk the classic lighters you know they use a very simple way a very tested way of lighting the gas so I would say that this one's probably pretty good for your main one and then just have your your bit classics as your backup lighter because if if anything goes wrong with this electronic trigger system to ignite it you know you're pretty much sunk but at least with this it's it's still very simple way to light a flame it may not be as fancy and reliable as this one but it's still this is still a good way to do this so anyway that's the test I'm just a little shocked because I've heard I've heard bad things about how these light in the cold of course it's not cold now I mean they're they're pretty much warmed up but obviously it's good to have a full bic lighter a brand new bic lighter because this one lit up like right away and then the electronic one is definitely a good one to have but but I would save and just make sure you have a classic Vic with you as well that's full so anyway that's my test I've been having fun doing this and I'll probably do some more on these lighters because a lot of people put them down because they're just so simple and cheap and I'm just starting to learn about them I mean I've only been fiddling with them for less than a month and I'm pleased with them and they're definitely gonna go out my bug-out bag or go into my bug-out bag so okay thank you for watching", "UkYJjEWtJaI": "for everyone I got asked in a comment the other day which is better for the money to clip a metal lighter or standard plastic clippers and it's quite a good question although they're both very cheap so there's no reason you can't get both so basically for the price of about four of these you can get one of these but clipper lighters are under a pound or a dollar if you're buying them in bulk so you can get these in pack of fours on Amazon and eBay and if you get them in a pack of four they are about two pounds or just over two pounds for four of them so that yeah basically being 50 cents or 50 pence a lighter is very good value because they're refillable as well and you can run clippers on the standard so a cheap butane you can replace the sort of four ocm Flint wheels on them but I think at that point you might want to just throw the lighter away because of how sort of cheap they are you can also get Clippers in various different styles a bit like Bix and ones of different like custom cases on but um anyway so for about four pounds you can get the metal Clippers done a video on this one before it's very nice lighter there are a couple of differences with them it's got the sort of circular wheel on this one not the hexagonal wheel that's on the plastic Clippers and on the bottom they're both refillable but there's a cheaper plastic sort of valve on this almost one's got a metal valve now the difference here is that you can actually adjust the gas flow inside the lighter here whereas on the cheaper clipper as far as I'm aware there's no way you can change the gas output I've taken these off before on some of them and there's nothing again underneath that you can sort of do and with a screwdriver or whatever to alter them in terms of striking metal Clippers are easy to strike we get a tipper just as easy but with the hexagonal wheel wipe further sort of circular wheel on the metal clipper but with the metal clipper as you can adjust the gas flow up using this I think I've got it set to maximum at the moment anyway it's obviously a bit easier to like it's on maximum gas flow you get more output of gas therefore it's easier to light lighter now about capacity there's actually a bit more capacity in a plastic one because it's quite a thick heavy metal case so if you assume that some of the space on the net one is lost with the case thickness you actually get more lighter fluid while actually butane gas inside the plastic clipper so that winds out that in terms of sort of strength you can drop these in the general right I think Lipper do one with a sort of soft shell on it as well as the plastic which is a bit tougher but both quite robust now in terms of what would I buy if I could only buy one lot it depends entirely if you're getting it to collect as a lighter or just as disposable so or just general use lighters I think if you're getting as a general use later you'd go for the plastic ones simply because you can get four for the price of a metal one whereas if you are going to get one was cut for collectors I think it looks a lot nicer getting a metal one with the little presentation box I want to get a plastic one and these metal ones you can I just went for this or brushed chrome steel look but you can get some of these and like multi colors or blue or you know other I was looking into a pink or a purple one um so yeah if I was just buying one personally I'd go for the metal one because I sort of like as a collectible and it's a very good lighter slightly better in places in the plastic one but if you're buying it just use the white or I go for the plastic one because you get four for one compared to the price of one of these you know you don't don't need to pay a couple of quid for a a lot of these um so yeah I go for the metal one now an interesting thing I saw an order video on it when it arrives they actually do a petrol clipper I had no idea about there's also a jet flame one like a jet layer but I've never seen one that's not secondhand and not being charged you know way more than they should cost so I've got a petrol one come in then we'll do comparisons between it in a Zippo but personally I prefer the matter one but if you're buying it just wanting a load of cheap lighters go for the plastic type", "upC3YGcva80": "hey what's up guys it's Jake coming at you with another video so today I'm going to show you five lighter tricks I'm actually a little bit sick right now so hopefully my voice don't sound too bad but bear with me so these are just some cool tricks to do if you have a few disposable lighters lying around in my case I bought a pack of like 50 for twelve bucks so it's a pretty good deal I'll put a link in the description if you guys want it alright I need to say this just a warning be very careful in doing these tricks remember we are dealing with fire so use good judgement alright let's get right to it all for this first one we're going to be making some cool exploding targets you're going to need a balloon a lighter of course and a candle so first take the lighter and rip the top off so you're left with just a valve now unscrew the valve until you hear some fuel leaking out then screw it back in just a little bit now put the ladder inside the bloom and blow it up a small amount really don't need much air and tie it off now through the balloon twist off the valve so the fuel starts leaking out slowly remember to pinch the lighter at the bottom through the bloom so the nozzle isn't touching the side if it does touch the side when the butane fuel comes out because it comes out as a liquid the bloom might pop because it'll freeze so once all the gas is out and into the balloon it'll expand more and you're ready to go so now just grab an airsoft gun or dart or something like that probably now light the candle and place it right behind the blimp not like too close still flame pops it but just close enough now when you shoot the bloom and it pops the butane will catch on fire and you now have an exploding target for very cheap all right this next one is a classic and you might have seen it before but it's too good not to show you all right so make a loose fist with your hand so there's a little bit of air inside then hold the lighter up to it like this and press down on the gas for about 10 seconds that might be later next your hand you now have a fireball in your hand pretty cool right all right so for this next one we need a bowl filled with some water some dish soap and two lighters all right first pour some dish soap into the bowl then break apart one of the lightest like we did in the first trick now unscrew the valve and put the lighter under water so bubbles start forming this is why it's important to use dish soap because they make the best bubbles now try picking up some of these bubbles and lighting it with the second lighter you now have a way to make flaming hands that won't bring you unless you do something really stupid but they shouldn't burn you all right here's another popular one everyone should know it's the classic lighter hack first make sure the ladder is on full blast and pop off the heat shield and lift up on the fuel dial now push it over to the other side and pull it back down and bring it back over again by Franklin fuel valve like this when we put the heat shield back on and put it all back together and then light it the flame is now massive all right so for this last one we're going making a mini flamethrower out of a bottle just grab a lighter and a plastic bottle hold the lightest gas nozzle and the bottle for around 40 to 60 seconds then light the top of the bottle when you squeeze there should be a flame that comes out just remember to be extra careful when doing this this flame can get pretty big and you don't wanna burn yourself all right well there's five of my best later tricks hope you guys like them and if you did don't forget to leave a like really helps out my channel also subscribe and check out my facebook in it you can get notified when I flip more videos also I'm still trying to figure out what I should do for my 50k video so something I'm thinking of it maybe like a Q&A video and possibly like the Facebook deal because so many of you guys been asking it's like kinda ridiculous so yeah if you have any ideas for that video questions you might want to insert leaving the comments below alright well as always thank you guys for watching and we will see you in the next one", "8km1VZ88MUM": "what's going on fellas I've got a 2012 Honda Accord here I'm gonna use this car to point out to you the location of the three fuses for the various cigarette lighters and power outlets so the first two for you to check are gonna be down here there is number 18 which is a seven-and-a-half amp fuse right there that's fuse number 18 this used does not directly power any of the outlets but it does provide power to the relays that energize that Privett send power to the outlets there's also a fuse 23 right here this blue 15 amp fuse fuse 23 provides power to the front power socket and the third and remaining fuse is going to be on the passenger side so making our way over to the passenger side you'll find the final fuse behind this cover slide that over and it's gonna be again a blue 15 amp fuse located right there number 12 and that one provides power to the rear outlet so yeah I hope this info was helpful for you guys please be sure to let me know if you have any questions or more importantly if you have any advice for troubleshooting the various power outlets on your Honda Accord thanks for watching", "Zz7BRmO0gR4": "hi guys Dave at a humble Trekker channel how're you doing today a real quick button knowledge-sharing about the difference between an electronic big lighter and the standard weird and flint big liar the white lighter is the standard bic with the wheel and flint light and mechanism the yellow lighter is the electronic standard BIC which is the pzo electronic striking method these are both putting no liars I just want to show you that the electronic bit lighter is much more waterproof than the white big liar let me fill my cup up with some water and I'll just dump more to light as it will let them sit there for a while I'll pull out the the wheel and Flint liar the white one first nice shape I'll pull out the electric electronic one straight out the water lies sometimes you have to flick it off without time went straight out put it back in there now time Ida flick it off a bit but straight back on this is stuff just pick this one up with the floor again it says anything back in the water let me flick it off of it nothing at all no spark at all in my experience the standard weird and flint liar this can take two three four five even six hours to dry out before you can use it again but the electronic one a couple of flicks of the wrist and it's working again thanks for watching give the video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it if you're not already subscribed I'd really appreciate you clicking down on that subscribe button so you can see more of my videos and I'll see you next time", "0TyCiE_D0MU": "well apparently this is something that's going on since the sixties since then it seems that stoners and people who use lighters they don't want to use them anymore because there seems to be a curse associated with it Bick lighters especially the white bic lighters Jimi Hendrix died in September 1970 in less than a month later Janis Joplin died of a drug overdose Jim Morris or the doors died back in 1971 all three were left-handed they all died the agent 27 and all we were reported to have a white lighter at the death scene even Kurt Cobain's autopsy report notes at the day there was a discovery of a white lighter at the scene plus there are numerous accounts of breaking your bong stash accidents just plain bad luck so be careful you", "9rXv5zaXGF0": "my guys out by the lake today testing two lighters we have their classic clipper and we have the BIC disposable mini both great lighters both really popular it's not a few tests on these and see which makes the best survival bushcraft lighter so the red lighter is the BIC the white light is the Clipper both currently working fine we're going to drop them in the lake down here come back after 10 minutes and see how they're getting on so the lighters have been submerged now for at least 10 minutes let's fish one out see if we can get that to light then we'll take the other one out and see if we can get that one too light so we got the Clipper first let's just shake it off give it a test now see even get it just get the Flint striking at the Flint sparking now starting to get flame not quite yet hi guys back at the car out you had a problem with the Clipper I managed to get the BIC back working so it's still a bit damp but it does it does now light the Clipper I had a problem with now was just going to abandon this test and not want to put it on YouTube but I thought just for the purposes of being honest and it's just to just see the results of this test basically what happened in the Clipper clip prophecy has to remove all Flint there's there's no Flint left I mean that you can just see the spring the spring that pushes onto the Flint that's gone so I mean the good thing about Clippers is they are refillable and you can remove the Flint so they kind of last longer than the BIC which you can't replace the Flint and it's non refillable I mean otherwise the Clipper does work you can light it from that one so as a lighter they both still work is unfortunate that the Flint went so we managed to get both working I was going to do more tests on these so if you like this video just give it a thumbs up and comment on it and we'll get the clip working and we'll put these two lighters through their paces but yes it's unfortunate that the Flint went on that I mean personally I probably prefer Clippers to Bix just by the fact they are more replaceable when you can keep them longer but in this test in this test today the BIC still a bit damp but it is working and the Clippers not be can like one from the other but there you go so that's the test day let me know in the comments and which which lighter do you prefer do you prefer the clipper or the BIC I know for American viewers the clips aren't so readily available in America Clippers are quite popular in the UK both cost about the same price you know one pound fifty odd in the UK bless today's video if you like this video just let me know and I'll get the clip of working and we'll rerun the test but for purposes of honesty I thought I'd just upload this to YouTube anyway so that's it for this one hope you liked it and I'll see you in a future video", "QEiqHnV8ZjY": "hey guys how's it going art walk 14 so today is a pretty long morning got off at about 5:00 obviously I've been working on those had to run over to my buddy Andres house he helped me out with some art supplies and gave me some things or for future trades and stuff like that collage is still drying up I actually yeah I'm not gonna tell you I had another thought that would like make this really pop but it would mean I have to put things in there that are about 80 bucks worth so anyway I'm gonna put a little pin on that we'll get back to that but um if that doesn't sell there's gonna be more done to it um let's see so I'm working on these lighters as promised yesterday let's see yeah let me show you some of it then I'm gonna show you how I did it how I did it I'll show you how I do it I picked out a comic book here have some stuff how to do it scissors and all that good stuff and yeah I'll show you how I make these things so obviously you want to buy some freaking buy some freaking lighters all right cheap lighters expensive lighters all that stuff it's entirely up to you but uh I like these clear ones because when an image is smaller like this one it's pretty cool too you know but the lighter itself adds to the little art on it so in the same vein of my medium which is working with the comic book images you know these are also cut out of comic books none of these are copied or printed out so all of this is just cut-up paper I got magazines or comic books that I find thereby so yeah let's see so let me zoom out here there we go nice look at that lens so yeah this is a book I've had for a while whatever I think it's a fairly new book it's like done in the style of the old books but so I went through this already just for this whatchamacallit tutorial or whatever it is so yeah there's your process you kind of look through these find an image that hits you or you know like this one right here I can cut that out on a square and there it says why of course they sound like Reds so yeah that's a good one I might do that let's see well that one's good that's like a nice little image yeah that one's good I think I'll do that see there's I think I saw a weirder one [Applause] nice that's a good one oh it's too too big though hmm I've been watching you quite a while I I know I've been waiting for you to do something that's a good yeah obviously like stuff like this is more fun I'm just doing this as a little example for you guys so I think see that I spend any more pages here yeah what did I see here hmm probably that yeah all right so I think I'm gonna go with actually just for fun let's see yeah right there there's a good that's a good image hold on a sec guys rip this out done with the demonstrates out the written paper out right okay so maybe I can't find my tripod because I've been doing a lot of different things but uh let's see just gonna cut this out and done we'll see how it fits so whatever man use your theater of the mind flip yourself around just cut that pretend you're looking through my eyes they're proof that I cut that out all right let's cut cut it so it looks nice sometimes you know you can cut out the actual character yeah kind of kind of kind of kind of I didn't do any of that but you know like cut around the line sometimes these actually look kind of hold on they look a little better all right so yeah okay so I'm not gonna cut around but let's see so what we do now grab a lighter I think I'll go with no red yeah go red for this so obviously it's too big so you know you know where it's gonna fit can only go so far so I have to cut out the monsters part No yeah I'm gonna no yeah I'm gonna leave the writing in there we don't need the bottom half of a conga there or I'm gonna do that real quick sorry I'm giving everybody where to go okay I know this is not exciting at all but I'll try to make this quick since this is just to show you but you know I'm not gonna just waste it then you want to wrap it around the lighter right this way you'll know how much excess paper you need to cut out I recommend making like a template piece of paper and then you know finding your images and play over them and cut out the part that's under template all right cool all right I'm gonna have to go right there put a little bit more you don't want this to go from like end to end you want her to be like couple of millimeters on your eye like so see there's a room on the bottom and there's still room on top okay useful trick obvious but uh just put like a ping on it a ruler and then just pull it so it gives it a curve that way it'll adhere to the thing better and coroner's won't peel up useful tip okay next we take our glue here you guys can use this you can use Mod Podge you can use straight-up Elmer's school glue you can use anything you want that glues things so in this case I'm using this because I was using it for that collage so I have it handy get your foam brush right here look at that okay so we have our lighter now our thing I'm gonna glue this so I'm gonna put you guys down again let's see if I can get a little elevation going here unfortunately all right my apologies well it's right there in front of you guys slaughter some glue on there don't like drown in it but uh I'm just spreading it out get rid of excess do a little more make sure it gets on every edge edges are the most important all right you got it on there then you put it on a lighter that's the trick people forget those of you that know this please don't comment in the section saying no whose obvious this is for those people that kind of want to make these for themselves at home and they never messed around with this nonsense so Plus this is an art blog I'm just showing what I'm doing all right so brush it on there your goal as such all right give it a second you don't want to like let it tacky up a little bit let it get a little goopy all right pick your side your main side that you wanted to display the main image and then it's as easy as a sticker kind of dig in that bit go right there in the middle did cool right there something like that yeah that works I take it alright so wrap it around close it up these rulers right here it's a good way to get the bubbles out just put it there put it there give it a quick press no bubbles done deal so there we go there's a there you go guys monsters cool right so you let this dry and then one more time give it one more coat so that it seals it in and you're good to go pretty much these are my older ones from a few years back they also have a protective finish on top as you can see it's like way shinier so that that process takes a little while because you need to wait for the glue that's water-based to dry and then you put on this other camera chemical but it makes these really resilient so like this is years it's been tumbling around in my office and boxes and drawers and you know it still looks nice and shiny and you know it's pretty cool I dig it so that's how I do those mmm there you go guys let me close up I guess a little bit for you so I made these for Wizard World Comic Con years ago I don't remember what year that was probably 2014 I think and I did really well with my collages they're sold pretty much everything and these lighters I just kind of made for fun and people just bought them up I was really happy about that I mean they're pretty cool but yeah I mean the main thing is having the images you want to put on there make sure they're images you like you know and that's all it is look at all these awesome looking lighters so yeah Oh who's me Plus this new one right there so yeah next what I'm gonna do is make a bunch of other like that's it for Power Ranger lighters I just wanted to make I don't know there's probably about 25 there so that's it for Power Rangers next I'm gonna do some you know like Marvel DC II do some Batman do some spider-man do some other stuff all sorts of things that are in the pop culture obviously so that's a that's the name of this art style that I do here I guess it's a pop art montage and 3d collage comic books out of their pages so yeah so yeah guys thank you all for watching right now what I'm gonna do is just give a quick shout out to the first one seventeen this morning I paid a visit to my boy there Andre and he hooked me up with this it's uh obviously the pop I have it here I have one inbox literally had to hunt for that but anyway that's what that looks like it's the pop whatever so this one's gonna make its way into a 3d collage kind of like that and we'll see how that all works out so Andre thank you so much I'll definitely it we'll work something out as a thank you for this alright he also hooked me up with this if you guys want to check out where these came from his boy Steve actually like went out hunting and got him a whole ton of these different ones different seasons and stuff like that all for five bucks at the Game Stop sale things sell he hooking up with this I need the weapon for my nonmetallic one so I was really stoked when he was like yeah you can grab that so Andre thank you I'll again hook you up with something as a thank you let's see gave me something else oh yeah he gave me some sunshine in a bag so mmm I think that's it yeah maybe a little bit okay guys thank you for watching this has been a art blog number 14 I hope you guys enjoy that I hope the awful awful angles with which I was filming out they obviously didn't show you anything but it's pretty straight forward once again you know you just cut out the image glue it on you're good to go simple as that and yeah so yeah thanks everyone tune in tomorrow where maybe I'll show you some of the other stuff I made and I'll be working and more more of these I might finish all the lighters up today I'm not sure I need to get back to making collages because I need to make at least six small pieces that I can take to the show with me so yeah all right guys thank you so much I'm really going this time this has been art blog number 14 my name is nazar check out my Instagram and nostalgic art and nostalgic TV to different accounts once for just my art and the TV one is just whatever I post that I feel like so but yeah alright that's it have another look-see at these and I'll see you guys tomorrow peace all right", "cRTOP_vJihU": "[Music] Rati what's going on today guys today I want to talk to you about the Nick multi-purpose lighter I have two of them right here I got these in a or pack they come in a 2-pack as well throw it the same thing it's just it just you know depends on how many you want to buy it once I like to buy as many as I can at once because I do go through them pretty quickly but yeah let's let's talk about them get this one away I'll just discuss this one so yeah these are pretty much you know your classic big multi-purpose lighters just like you know Zippos or the small big lighters they're all very very similar this one's I guess just as much of a classic you know use these for I don't know a lot of things sliding my grill handles really really just anything they're great for hard-to-reach places which is what I like them for you know much better than trying to use a tiny lighter and lighting it did now pretty pretty standard build nice plastic grip right here hey economic feels good in your hand you know just like almost like holding the edge of like a night person like that that's almost like kind of the size of it this nice long metal wand it's great because it keeps your hand very far away from the flame again great for hard-to-reach places you don't don't worry about you know earning yourself or anything which is awesome and it's much much better than these smaller lighters you have two buttons really really easy to use two buttons on the top one is this child proofing big pretty big on that all the lighters that I have gotten from them they're like this have this child proofing thing on the top essentially it just what it what it does takes a lot of force to press down so you know as you can see it it definitely has you really got a really push on it to get it down and that's the only way that you can get your flame going that's the only way you can pull this trigger and get the flame to come out and then this you know as your trigger this is actually what lights it it's very easy to light did you see oh right there crazy to light you can do it with one hand you know it depends because some people say they have trouble if you have like arthritis or something like that but you know for the most part it's pretty easy to light with one hand and I think the childproofing is the way definitely worth having the childproofing on there just in case and then on the back pretty much the last thing about this is that there is a little retractable hook here I never use it and actually honestly just just kind of noticed it but you know I assume it's good for you know maybe hanging if you have something like a bulletin board style thing in the wall or in your garage you can just hang a bunch of these there and it's you know store all your lighters nice and away or store them up high so your kids can't even reach them which is you know also really great yeah they're nice they're safe they're really thin which I really like I use these a lot when I go camping bring them out there so we are able to light a fire light a fire pit and it's really easy to just pack away because it's so thin small and because it has the safety on it I don't feel you know scared pecking away that it's actually accidentally gonna burst or accidentally get a light you know burn my stuff so it's nice to have that there these things I would say last about a month each the constant use and when I mean constant use I mean using it like you know once or twice a day so you know for the price I think that's pretty solid especially considering that you know you're probably also not going to be using these everyday because you really only need these for special kind of hard-to-reach lighting situations that's what you need them for other than that you can use a regular little lighter but if these are the only ones you have on Yelp they'll last you about a month for me that works out really well last thing you can see on here they have a really good sized flame really nice and big very easy to light with you know if you're you know lighting lots of candles and everything you never have to worry about the flame being too small that's one thing I noticed with them you know regular lighters sometimes the flame is just too small and not powerful enough to really get something lit quickly so that's why I really really like these prepared other lighters overall you know big trustworthy company they make tons and tons of lighters and I've been getting these for years and they still make them they still make them the same as they always have you know I really recommend them if you're looking for a good multi-purpose and already guys take it easy [Music]", "3kMmNz65lbg": "and everyone I've had this lighter for about two weeks now the clip a petrol itis I wanted to do a comparison between it and the Zippo wind proof - classic Zippo so obviously here's the little wind proof we all know it's lighter and you'll notice that it's not lighting because it's run out of fuel as usual which is standard for Zippo but what surprised me of this is despite being a petrol lighter and these filling out two weeks ago not even fully filled for a video it still lights and I've not any more fuel in since two weeks ago because I wanted to see how well it would last so it is still got fuel in it and that's what impressed me so having this bit that seals here and an o-ring at the bottom where you fill it really does work quite well for a petrol lighter I'm still waiting for my peanut lighter to come in the postal see how that does but so far it might be my favorite petrol lighter so I'll talk about what's good about it compared to a Zippo and where it is not as good as a Zippo so in terms of actual design I think I mean obviously the Zippo is the classic lighter but I mean it's actually personally what you prefer both lighters I think look very nice they've got kind of an antique look to them I'd say Zippo does wind slightly on style points because of how we know classic the wind proof is so I think this clip a lighter is obviously a better design pressure keeping in petrol so refilling them is the clip you'll see clean the bottom without you lift the salt up and then cover it in petrol or you can I guess put the petrol nozzle through there so that way we'll just completely sudden it with petrol but there's no oh ring or anything and as lots of you know Zippos evaporates you'll over time to the point where they don't work so you have to really if you're taking the zipper up survival reasons take a fuel come with it rather than just lighter by itself I'd say normally they only last about a week once you fully fill the Zippo for all the petrels evaporated out so with this lighter open the bottom up and you should hopefully be able to see on their lien frame at my sleeve there is an o-ring on here how physical that is on the camera I don't know but there is no ring on this section here at the very end see it there and that Oh ring how stop fuel evaporation now if I Smith this still very strong smell the petrol on it starting to feel not so it's not totally dry bulbs you can tell it's dry it out a bit use light as always do so to fill out you just literally squirt the fuel in there - it's all sodden and then you've got a very far field lighter and then just you notice li screw this back on and then that's on tight and you can use a coin or a screwdriver to tighten the bottom if you want really tight by sound that's tight enough for you to stop fuel of operation then on the top you've got this cap here which blocks a wick which stops evaporation at this end and there's no or in on this section bit doesn't really need it it's just got sort of a metal bit that clips into so another thing of this lighter fluid is very easy to replace like all clip the lighters if we can get a grip on it just pull that out so you can put a new slim rod in standard clip a type of flint rod parousia and that's that I don't think the wick is replaceable as far as I can tell that with most these lighters like vapors you don't really need to replace the wick because it's only really there just to soak up the fuel it's not really there to actually burn like a sort of candle wick as such so I imagine this light would last pretty much indefinitely even if you didn't replace the wick on it if there is a way of replacing the wick it's guaranteed for two years by clipper anyway so you must be pretty certain they're not going to fall apart in that time after the Zippo what is much better of a Zippo is it has much better wind proofing I'm going to refill up and demonstrate that you but again at the top there's no sort of Oh ring a total a Zippo so you get a lot more evaporation and as I said as they probably last about one week this was filled up about two weeks ago and it's still going sign so I'd be tempted to see how long on a single refilling this light will actually last about any fuel at all going in and if it reaches a month I'll be very very pleased with it but just two weeks alone is very good because it's double what you get from a Zippo so I'm going to fill this up and then I'm going to show you how the Zippo is actually better to be in wind brute as name implies in the clip lighter right so I've totally refilled both lighters so this is a fair test but I'll demonstrate the wind proof Ness of the lighters and obviously you'll note as if I win this because it's got the sort of shield around there and that's in its name the Zippo wind proof you see nice big flame coming off of that a big blow on it and it will go out sort of like a very big gust of wind with it out but with a normal amount wind it will keep going so again big cast you'll go out with the Clipper now I think this might not be lighting now because I put so much petrol into it the wicks quite damp so just give that a moment to dry out and I'll demonstrate this one right here we go I've dried the Clipper off again and there you go it's lit as you can see as a bit of fuel going around the top where some of the petrels leaks from the wick where I overfilled it a bit but it's working fine but if I just demonstrate blowing out and it will be a wind unlike the Zippo and it will go out normally it likes first time I said I think it's just clothes so solder mollies refilled it there's you can see it'll go out very easily so the wind proofing isn't as good as a Zippo what you'd have any nowhere near as good of a Zippo basically you'd have to shield it as you light it to protect it from the wind both get fairly warm in your hands after a while of being lit so there's not any advantage or disadvantage there if you want it as a hand warmer those would be good for that if you don't want your hands going too hot when you're using it neither a very good for that so which is the winner it's hard to say personally I like the Clipper I think simply because of the fact that I can put fuel in it and I don't have to worry about it going out within a week of just total evaporation whereas the Zippo I know within a week of me totally filling this tonight it's going to be dry but I want to see how long if I don't put any more fuel in now the Clipper will last about refilling now it's been totally refilled because I'm hoping it might reach a mumps and if it does I'll be very pleased with it so that's the clip of petrol lighter versus if I wind proof those are very cool lighters again soaks fresh from overfilling we explained on the end of that zip line I love it yeah both very good lighters obviously for wind proofing Zippo wind so lighting easily I think the Zippo is a bit better than air because over fitting it doesn't seem to really hurt it lighting but for actual keeping of petrol for fuel economy and the least amount of petrol evaporation the clips are quite clearly winds both very nice fighters", "jpgJ1KNj4e4": "hello everyone this new video is on some novelty lighters another thing I collect I know someone someone mentioned that I what don't I collect it's true I have a lot of different weird collections but this is just something you know found on vacation you know somewhere or doing some kind of day trip or whatever the situation may be sometimes you know at the gas station I haven't done this recently I haven't bought a new novelty lighter and probably a year and a half or so this is more when I was younger you know early teens like thirteen fourteen but I would always love to pick up these different crazy you know lighters butane lighters at gas stations and you know flea markets and stuff like that but this is a video of my collection before I get into it I will show you a the one butane lighter that I actually use if I'm not using a Zippo I'm using butane this is the lighter that I will use when I bought this I think at a gas station many years ago simple pop top and here that good loud click it is butane and then when you let go it's got dual flames so this is actually I believe advertised as a cigar lighter you know because it's hands-free I do is get that initial flame going and there you go kind of like a Zippo but I always thought that was pretty neat that's the one I actually use now most of these if you notice I have an old cartridge container I keep all my lighters in here just because it's safe you know if one explodes or something I don't do a worry about it I'm going to try to get through all of them I quite a bit and some are actually lighters but they're lighter holders like I said I try to get through these now for the most part most of these have they don't have any fluid left in them because once they run out I throw them into this thing you know towards my collection this is actually a lighter holder it holds one of those small mini Bix you know see this was a this is actually crappy later but I bought this on I was on the it's actually slow fluid in it this is not refillable it's just a little cheapo lighter but I got this when I went to the Zippo Factory of course I bought a couple of Zippos when I was there but we went to actually a some kind of Indian Reservation or something and I picked this up just as kind of like a you know a little something remember if I this holds a is not a lighter but it's a lighter holder actually I think I got this free with a lot of Zippos on eBay one time you know just hold it a throwaway lighter and Scrabble pocket clip in the back some mean I never used it just during the collection this is just a skinny skinny little lighter again this one's not with fillable but kind of a weird unique design I guess if I picked it up this one don't think I could see it doesn't have any fluid in it but I thought this was cool it's a you know completely clear this was butene but like I said most of these are empty now this was actually my sister's when I did a Zippo mini she made one too and this is not a genuine Zippo but basically we you know I showed how to do it she was young she was one she was probably like six or seven at the time but you cut the insert you take you take out the screw and the the spring and all that and you cut the tube and the insert and you replace it only with half of the rayon balls and then you modify the case take off the the hinge cut a space for that and it's kind of complicated but of course getting a little older she realized that she can care less about lighters and she just gave it to me and I threw him a collection but I have one that I made it out of a regular Zippo a real Zippo this is actually some shiniest lighter see the next one this just has a regular green torch heats up it's actually lit right now there you go there's the green now if you have one of these how this works is you can see that little glowing that piece starts to glow to that red in there there's a little ball of some kind of chemical I don't know what it is but that heats up and that's what actually is is um you know giving you that green appearance in your flame they're pretty popular now this is kind of cool I think my parents bought me this you know it's like an oil oil can like I said just unique something different surfboard forget I got that and looks like that might have been the last of the float this one's pretty cool this one actually does that mean fluid input looks like a cigarette top flop up pops open a little Flint in there but it's empty right now that's where you would refill it the bottom let's try go a little bit faster this is actually one I bought this is a Calibri pretty nice actually genuine scrimshaw on the front the Ducks pond does not have any fluid left in it but this is a pretty classy classy later I carried this for a long time the next one looks like I don't know if that's supposed to look like a coffee pot or what but got a top pops and it's got a green flame and a blue LED in the bottom pretty cool again I don't use these lighters at one time thought it was cool and I say well why for the collection there's a little jet this um push this pops top then you um you push the front here it's kind of safety push that and then down you have a fine very fine blue flame that's called a the pioneer I'm sure a thousand cities were made and they're all named some different see this is pretty cool this is actually where I stole the emblem I'll show you I actually took two of these and I took this emblem off and attach it to a Zippo this one's actually one of my favorite one crap there's no fluid in it but it's pretty cool you rotate this knob and you have a regular flame and when you rotate it you rotate it to a red flame red like jet flame and then green and then back to a regular single flame and unfortunately I can't show you that because no fluid left but this is one of the cooler ones I've had next one here slot machine and you can't really see that but you spin it's the lighter and needs a little watch battery it's kind of the noise is that kind of fading out but so this coil looks like a little matchbox car some kind just top pops open no fluid left but that's the lighter the wheels move you could hear that that slot machine fading out batteries definitely dying this is actually my grandfather so used to always use this this was just battery operated a little coil heated up just like your lighter in your car and it's flameless so this worked in any condition so I'll just use a little lecture Z to heat some coils and you would stick your cigarette in the end and that was it next one a little throwaway lighter but this is just basically the case I got this when I was really little but that was cool the eyeball but I was like 10 years old little immature but I still think it's kind of cool cool for the collection why not I have to no idea why two different foot lighters this actually holds a again one of those mini Bix and then I later found this one because I had this one of course I had to get this one too and this one has a regular flame but of course it's out of fluid so we also got here these two actually these three these are all lighters from the 50s you see that Pall Mall logo on there basically you'd fill this with us a regular lighter fluid and this would uh as this tip lifted it would a spark and of course light the wick and then all three these work same way this one's a little stiff but none of them s to it this one friend blocked back from Aruba obviously I think there's no battery power left but you know the nipples would uh with their little red LEDs and they would just blink when you used it and actually I have more lighters I thought I'm going to have to stop this here because I'm at nine and a half minutes so I guess I'm going to call this part one and I guess come back and check out part two thanks guys", "vCO_VrggtPE": "since the 90s the lighter market has become overrun with poor quality generic lighters mainly from Asia due to the lack of technology lack of production controls and the use of low quality materials these lighters pose a potential danger in their everyday use not all lighters on the market are unsafe there is another option choosing quality and safety the clipper choice your choice the quality of a lighter is determined by the following parameters design a high-tech structural design that allows it to pass numerous resistance tests materials the use of high performance and high quality materials control a comprehensive and strict control during and after the production process clipper lighters are known around the world as high quality lighters they meet and exceed the international safety standards thanks to a unique carefully studied design high quality materials and the use of the most advanced technology in the manufacturing process the result is a product designed and manufactured to ensure safety a continued investment in R&D for over 40 years has helped clipper develop its own structural design technology guaranteeing complete safety for a product containing liquefied butane gas one of the main characteristics of a clipper lighter is the material used in its construction setting it apart from the other lightest offering additional features the plastic used is nylon polymide 66 a material that is self extinguishing flexible on impact without cracking resistant to extreme temperatures the gas is isobutene in liquid form it is a gas that provides less pressure than gas commonly used in other lighters propane and butane this lower pressure provides greater security for the user flama gas has developed its own unique and exclusive flame valve with a constant flame height ensuring greater safety and stability the incorporation of the child-resistant mechanism when necessary all clipper lighters comply with the ISO 9990 for safety standard and other international standards compliance is secured by 45 checkpoints during and after the production process this includes clippers flame height controls micro leak control lighting and after burn control and many others to ensure the quality and use a safety of our product as the Clipper lighter has more than exceeded expectations in its various trials it has become a brand that can ensure a unique level of quality laboratory comparisons between a clipper and a low-quality lighter make the difference clear flame height to minutes of continuous flame flammability test internal pressure temperature for hours at 65 degrees drop test in these six tests you've just seen imitate conditions lighters can be exposed to in real life as you'll have seen not all lighters perform equally a lighter is a mass-produced article that contains high pressure and due to this requires special attention on the part of the manufacturer any quality problem can also become a safety problem for the consumer with a clipper you'll always be guaranteed a product with the highest quality and safety standards on the market we hope that after seeing this video you'll be more aware of the risks involved in buying a generic cigarette lighter the decision is yours light with clipper for its quality for your safety you", "9yC8p-veRN0": "all right this lab you know now there's a way for you guys to make money if you're an artist okay so especially if you're a smoker you're going to really like this project know what we are going to be talking about today is making your own custom lighters just like this one or like this one doesn't matter what type of lighter it is size and all you're gonna need is of course your favorite kind of lighter some scissors a Photoshop a ruler maybe or a tape measure to figure out what size you need to make your rat some high quality sticker paper or a company that will provide that for you and that's it from there we can get started so the first thing you want to do is you know get your design together this was my design right here one of the designs that I use from time to time and since I work in an LA area it's easy to sell these lighters to people that stop by well my mom stopped by when I'm bending or when I have like a pop-up or something or our show if they don't want to buy something too crazy expensive a lot of times they just buy lighter or you know if they need to smoke real quick or whatever the case may be and nobody around has a lighter they'll borrow from me especially because that you know they're the designs are really dope and they're exclusive in a way that like you can't I made it so it's not like you could just walk it to the gas station are walking to a smoke shop or order online from big the same exact lighters because I made the design and I have to decide so is that so um this one right here is especially nice as a torch lighter and you know it's wind proof so these you could probably sell for a little bit more even though they cost the same as a big or maybe even cheaper but a lot of people like Bix just because um I don't know it feels good in the hand it's it's a lot of reasons you can like a big it's just a quality lighter you know Naveen so you can sell you the Ordos or you can sell the to $4 lighters at the gas station to wrap those with art you know any of those different types of lighters will so as long as you have some cool artwork on them and you know you're in a place where there's gonna be some smokers around which is pretty much anywhere you go somebody around and smokes and with like the lighter so anyways after you get your design the the the size the design depends entirely upon what type of lighter you decide to wrap and that could be you know like I said a big or the two $4 or source lighter like this or the clips lighters that they have or Clippers I think they're called there's a lot of different lighter sizes so the smart thing to do is to get your lighters first or get your lighter first if you worry about a case or buy the single and measure the lighter and see what size they are see even this right here it's too big for this lighter so I'd have to cut it down and that's why you need a ruler or like some scissors so because a lot of places won't even give you the exact size you need and you're gonna have to probably do a little bit of cutting anyway to make it fit so let's walk through how to wrap this thing see depending on your design you might want to cut from the top or the bottom and I think I want some cuts from the other side okay so you get your measurement I actually don't have a ruler so I'm gonna have to use other items to get this done now I only have a red lighter and a blank design but the smart thing to do is to if you have a black design have a black lighter if you have a red design have a red lighter if you have a great design of a real or like maybe the red lighter complements your design because your design is black but it also has like a red logo or sidelong just something you want a complement couple you want it to complement so that like if by chance you do make a weird cut and they can see the bottom of a red it's it matches it so it's like it's cool now if you want to take it a step further which is what I tend to do like with these you can take a razor and peel this label off and it'll come off just fine just just good enough to where you can reattach it like one more time and it'll stick just fine so you could take that off stick it down and then wrap your lighter and then put the sticker back and it'll like not only will it make it look more official but it'll hide the crease or the end of the pattern that you have on your design [Music] so here's the lighter that I made um in hindsight maybe I could have made the logo smaller or it's still cool like this I like it it's very sleek and plain but it beats just having a regular pink big or regular you know what I mean it just this is a cool I don't have people will pay more for this lighter like I saw these for like five dollars a piece you can sell this one for more probably because it has a torch Winkle that'll convince people to buy and offer it you need a light and the places you might want to go to get these done maybe you might want to just print from home which is not a bad idea to save money probably but what I would recommend is probably going to sticker app I use those guys a lot I use you prints I use sticker mule those guys are pretty good but sticker app just happens to be my favorite because their quality they just the quality of their stickers this feels are really really good like these feel like like the color is not gonna fade from the Sun if you get it wet the paper is not gonna ruin it's like really it's a really good high quality vinyl sticker and this one's pretty good too and as well as this one and I've gotten all of these from sticker at those guys aren't really good with doing their stuff so and not only that the price is really good like you could spend $20 and get a handful of these stickers and just if you want to just have a personal collection of lighters but the reason I made this video is because a lot of people always ask me like you know how do you make your lighters how do you how did you what do you who made that for even people think that I could have custom-made personally for me which is something that you can do but it costs more money because your your body you have to buy in a larger scale either that or you can honestly you can order like custom liners from BIC like those so you make you a custom body upload your design but they're gonna charge you five dollars or something like that per lighter when you can just get the sticker paper okay like a lot of them for like I don't know like 20 spend 20 bucks and get like 6 or 7 or more square sheets that you could use and then just buy the lighter separately for a dollar so each and you know it just worked that way so this is just an alternative to having another creative item that you could sell to people if you're in that type of artist and we want to make money from your art in various different ways or if you're just like you know you like me and you're smoker and you have a lot of lighters laying around and you just you'd like them to look better than what they look like you know the beans just this is a cool project that you can do so hit the subscribe button hit the like button to share button um if you decide to make some liners you can hit me up like my histogram or whatever take a picture I'd like to see him it's pretty cool I'll share amory share all my stories and stuff but yeah thanks for watching peace [Music]", "FEM9j9hE07Q": "what is going on guys so if you don't know by now I like to mess around with fire on the occasion all right that might have been a bit of an understatement but yeah I like fire so today I'm gonna show you six really cool fire tricks that you can do pretty easily so I'm going to start this video off with a few simple lighter tricks now some of you might have seen these before but I got to show you guys the classics so just bear with me and we'll get to some other stuff in a minute now I just have to say this up fun don't do this if you're a kid don't do this in the wrong environment and definitely have something like a fire extinguisher nearby just in case anything goes wrong with that being said let's get into this so I wouldn't got myself a pack of 50 of these really cheap lighters and they work great for projects like this so I'll link that below if you want to go check that out alright let's start off with a simple one just grab like a small piece of paper or something you could probably do this one just on your hand but if it's your first time doing this a piece of paper might be nice all you want to do is just hold the paper like this grab your lighter and just lightly stroke the Flint wheel of the lighter try not to let the lighter light or else this won't work and what you'll notice after doing this for a while is longer you do this you'll eventually get this fine powder that forms on the card and this is actually ground-up Flint and this stuff is actually really flammable and so a cool thing to do of course is to light it on fire now for this next one if you have two lighters lying around and you don't mind breaking one of them here's a really cool trick you can do first pick one of your letters to sacrifice and now rip off the casing and what we're after inside is the little tiny piece of Flint and it'll be spring-loaded so be careful because it will pop out at you it's going to be real tiny so make sure you don't lose it and now what we want to do is wrap the spring around this piece of Flint it actually helps a lot to stretch out the spring itself and there we go we now the Flint inside the spring and now all we want to do is take our Flint and grab our lighter and we want to heat up the Flint until it turns red hot and then we're going to chuck it against that wall so for the next trick the next time you finish off that drink remember to save we can so grab you can and grab you later now we're going to do basically the same thing we did with our hand just in the can so we're going to push down the gas and fill up the can you can leave it in about 30 seconds I'd say 20 to 30 seconds now with this full take your lighter and make sure to hold it below the can so you out of the way of the flame and slowly light it and tip the can over just like that alright guys it is now time for the classic later hack so notice the size of this flame alright pretty average here's how to make it a whole lot bigger first take off the outer casing of the lighter if you see this lever right here this is how to this is how to control the size of the flame so right now this is the lowest setting if we turn it all the way up we get a flame about this big all right not bad here's how to make it huge lift this lever up so it's off the gear slide it over so it's really back down and then slide it over again do this maybe once or twice and now we have a massive flow alright guys so those are probably the most common I'm not saying they're not cool but oh this is probably the most common lighter tricks but here's one that I bet you've never seen before so yeah everyone else is going to be walking around with their giant lighter flames but here's how to make an even bigger flame out of a lighter for this one you're going to need a lighter with a fill port now these are pretty common but this is important that has this and then you'll also need a paperclip next you want to grab your paper clip and just straighten it out and leave a little Bend right at the end and we're just going to bend it so it'll fit the lighters bottom and then once you've got it the taper to the outside like this and then you want to find something long and straight you could use anything I'm just using an allen key I'm just anything that you can use to push this paper clip down without having your fingers in the way because this is where the fires going to shoot out and we don't want to get burned then all you got to do is just push down on this lever and light a letter in front of it and it'll shoot out alright so there's a few lighter tricks now another super easy thing to get your hands on are some matches so here's how to light a match with another match so first grab two matches and then all we're going to do is strike one match against the other with a lot of pressure it does take a little bit of practice but you'll get it there we go and you never really know which match is going to light usually it's the one you're striking but sometimes it's other one now here's how to connect these four matches together first you want to make four holes about a square inch apart from each other in the top of your match box next take your four matches and stick them inside the holes and now bend them all together so that all their tips are touching and now all we got to do is light the tips the four matches are now connected well there you go guys six super easy super simple tricks to deal with fire so that's pretty much it for this video guys give it a thumbs up if you did like it subscribe for some more cool projects and I will catch you in the next

need for this is a bic lighter of course either a white one or one that has the wrapping on it so you can take that off and be left with a nice clean bare lighter for demonstration purposes i already wrapped this one with this uh kind of older decal i had but you could throw on stickers or decals just kind of cut them to shape and then wrap them around it this one i just kind of stuck on there was old and kind of mangled already so i was like why not but for the main kind of customization nail polish or some paint is going to work really well of course you're going to be able to do your own designs i got red and blue here at some point in the future we might go a little bit more in depth with uh the designs of course you can just go at her you know just give her some lines obviously don't get it on the metal part of the of the actual lighter but if you do you can just wipe her off like i just got a bit on there but don't be don't be getting it at the top can throw a clear coat on this as well like i said it doesn't have to be fancy you know what i mean just color in a little bit and then you know you could you can do up some patterns anything you want if you need to you might you might have to do multiple coats or depending on the color of the lighter if it's like a solid one already it's going to work as as well too so you know we'll we'll go back and forth i'm going to try not to mix up the colors because i'm not going to lie these are my fiances so this is what i used to do back in the day could get some sweet looking lighter some artsy stuff you know what i mean some minimalist looking minimalist looking stuff and of course if you want you can start to write things out you know maybe maybe draw some faces we'll get a nice little smiley face going on this side oh this is looking this is looking beautiful pablo picasso would be would be jealous let's get a little let's get a little nose going oh yeah look at that beautiful you know what i mean nice little face let's go ahead let's go ahead put a little bit of let's go put like i you know heart oh it's not coming out well obviously if you get a nice paintbrush it's going to look a lot better but for just the the minimalist designs well i was trying to do i heart then i was going to write like of marijuana's or something there's no way it's gonna happen so you know let's turn that one into a bigger face you mess something up can always be turned into an a face it's a happy mistake you know what i mean happy accidents there is no mistakes sorry bam it's just a bigger smiley face now no problem you know what i mean of course you like colors dry you can start to do some some other layers you know you could rate it a little 420 or something if you want i'm just going at her for speed purposes but you know that's pretty mangled looking little little 420 at the bottom there oh it looks like nothing 420 basically of course set her up you know you can you can customize as much as you want add some different layers write whatever you want on it if you have a probably a finer brush that you could use to really get some some elegant stuff on there you can start to get some some fine detail if you have a lot of patience but i do not so you know what i mean throw a little throw some dots on there why not bam looking good take a little bit more blue like i said you can use stickers or or decals to to get similar effects you know let's just let's let's dab her in between get some funky patterns going on you know what i'm saying of course if i had more colors i could get a little bit more artsy with it but i think for what it is it's fine of course let it dry before you use it or it's gonna it's gonna get your hands nail polishy i already got a bit on my fingers can throw a clear coat on it if you want it to be a bit more protected uh different shades of clear coat you know what i mean if you wanted to be shiny or not you know we got the double smiley face blue and red uh abstract 420 at the bottom see if you can kind of see it see there's the zero there's the two kind of in the middle looks like a five almost and then that just does not look like a four but like i said you can get some sweet designs out of it obviously i half-assed it a little bit in the future might have some more elegant videos showing off some more cool designs if i can get a bit more colors or a bit more options but uh you know tell me how your designs went you know on instagram you could send me some pictures i might show them off if you have some cool designs make sure to tell me in the comments how it went or if you have any cool ideas you know like share and subscribe check out my other videos and thanks for watching peace", "AOCo_8rPP4U": "to be truly prepared especially in an

"hello YouTube I'm David with the David West Channel well today I want to show you something that I have not shown you with a lighter before I've shown you how to get fire with an empty lighter and these two are empty and then I've shown you how to get how to recover a Bick after it's been soaking wet to where you can get the flame again but what I have not shown you is how to recover an empty lighter that's also wet and it's going to work the same way as these work individually let's go ahead and do a refresher course first let me show you the empty bic ignition then I'll show you recovering the wet back and then we'll take one of the empty ones and we'll wet it and go ahead and make fire with it recover it and make fire with it this is fat wood all right now we'll take a couple of these shavings here roll it into a little pointy cigar and stick it down right in here and you're gonna hold it you're gonna have to put your finger in jeopardy because when it lights up this fat woods gonna stick to your finger a little bit and you're gonna have to shake it off so you're gonna have to take your chance of getting a little bit scorched on your fingertip let's try that again so I've shown you that one before now let me show you the one where we cover a wet Vic all right let's get it good and wet and are you gonna do like I have shown you before all you're gonna do is take a knock most of that water out of there and also like to pop that guard off of there so you see we have a guard around the outside of it and then another guard over the round striker wheel if you take a knife or something and stick it right in that corner you can pry it up it's just gonna pop up just a little bit from where its fitted right there and when that pops up a little bit then you take your fingernail and take it off so like I say you're gonna stick your knife in that corner right there and just pop it up a little bit like that and make sure that this is pushed down it's not holding on to it and it should come off with your fingernail like that so and the way to get this guard off is to bend it all the way forward and that'll let you pull it out so now continue knocking the excess water out of that and then we're going to dry that striker wheel on our shirt it does not take much to recover a  and when you're no longer knocking water out of it then you can take your shirt and dry that striker wheel off and it does not take much to I know the wind is blowing let's try it let me stand right here in front of wind tried to stand over here in front of the wind well you see there's enough spark for it start so very easy to recover a and if you feel safer about it you can pop this you pop this back on it too if that makes you feel safer about it it pop right back on there so let's go ahead and take whichever one of these has the stronger Flint is the one I'm gonna I'm gonna try it this one seems like it has a tighter and stronger Flint let's wet this one down and [Music] go ahead make up some fat wood shavings don't you see that there's still water being knocked out up we'll drive that wheel off as best you can I think we've got most of it knocked out of there let me dry that wheel more than that and I still don't have sparks coming out of it I'm gonna dry it some more you let's try it'll fall apart if you don't hold your finger that close to it so you're gonna heat your finger up a little bit but it may be worth it to you to get fired let's try it again and it went out that's the second time they've met flames there's the fluffy tinder I want to put it in let's not alone all right so I want you to check out my other video where I used all kinds of different tenders with an empty bic and ignited them it was 12 or 13 tenders that I used with an empty Beck and I'll go ahead and put the link to that video right here and it'll be in the description so if you see a Bic in the ground or in the stream or laying on the ground somewhere you sure better pick it up it's a great way to make fire even when it's empty and when it's also wet thanks for joining me on this one we catch you on the next one you", "21zu2hiJMOs": "so here's the letters that I'm going to be making against the two times clear loss that I'm going to be spraying and we always do this in a well-ventilated area come outside next just regular paper I'm playing just make sure you get it even the colts and after this dries out show you how to do it okay now here's how we size for the lighter you want to unlock you want to make this lock box unlocked and then you come up here to the width and you put in the width which is one point two eight four and then you tab over to the height and the height for each bit lighter is two point seven five and then that is the appropriate size and then you duplicate it once you duplicate it you get it as close to each other as you possibly can without overlapping it looks about good to me so now we're gonna click off over here into the white and then highlight both of the pictures then we're gonna go up here to arrange nope just kidding' we're gonna go to a line and we're going to align the bottom and I had it pretty much aligned already I've been doing this for quite a while so now we're gonna attach once attached we're going to flatten well technically you don't have to flatten it it just makes it one picture so if you're using the cricket to cut then you want to definitely flatten it because if you don't use the flatten method it's going to cut each square individually and then you're gonna be right back to square one but you want to attach so it's easy to directly round the lighter so from here I unlock the box and I did something a little bit wrong because right here for the whole width I want it to be five point two zero six make sure you unlock the box because if you don't unlock the box it's gonna shrink up the whole picture and then you can lock it we like it it's all that to you because but from here we're just gonna make it and because it's not sublimation there's no need to mirror the image so we're just going to continue just like this and then from here we sent to printer make sure you take this bleed off and then make sure you select the correct printer if you have more than one printer links again this is not stuff LeMay ssin so we're not going to be using that Epson printer make sure it's on your regular Canon printer and then you hit print okay now for this part you can use any color lighter that you want to use except for if you have like a lighter white or something in your picture because then the darker lighter would be able to see through it so from here we're just gonna take this off the sticker the warning label off as you can see it underneath this is not the same pictures I'm waiting for it to dry this is me and one of peach a customs Minnesota alright your Mod Podge your lighter a paintbrush and a six thousand I'm gonna take that modge podge and put a little dab on the piece of paper no need to get a bowl long-missing just go to paper away right so now we're gonna take this piece of paper for the lighter and you're gonna wrap it around like just to make sure it fits like I said I've been doing this for quite a while so it's pretty much good as gold and it is good as gold so that's the finished product oh the spray paint you just need a little dab of glue you can't because it it's white but it's right here and I'm using a bigger paintbrush because it's the one first one I saw but you just want to get the thinnest layer possible I'm lighter you don't need too much too much will cause bubbles underneath and that's what we're gonna try to avoid but try to get all over the piece of paper especially the bottom so we can wrap it under so now we're just gonna take the middle of the paper and stick it on the middle of the lighter the front waist not where the red part is but the front way and we're just gonna try to get it as perfectly aligned as we can then you first you only want to do one side you only want to lay it on one side first and try to keep that down as flat as possible should have wiped this lighter down with alcohol first but whatever for me anyways alright while the glue is still wet you want to try to slide it to maneuver it to get it to fit as perfect as can be like as such and then you got one side down you want to push that down as much as possible start folding in the bottom and it should be sticking because you put a little layer of glue on there you can use whatever minds project prefer I like this one cuz it's a quicker dry should just stick it to the bottom it's not sticking very well so we're just gonna take a little dab of glue and just dab the glue up in there just press it down now for this lip sticking up it's still much Podge on there but to ensure the lighter does not peel cuz I'm charging $10 for these so the worst thing I want is for somebody to pay $10 for a bit lighter and then them come back and tell me that it peeled and it does not peel after you do this method and I know that because I've made myself three of them already but you take the e6000 mine's in the bag cause a hole popped in it but I love this glue I love this school this is the best go out here alright so you just want to take again the thinnest possible the thinnest possible you shouldn't do this but I'm going to but I'm just gonna take my finger and spread the e6000 across cuz you only need a very thin layer 6000 takes forever to dry wipe off your ping here once in my pants and then you're just gonna press it down and you're gonna want to hold it for just a second see when I press it down and just hold it for just a second not so long well mm long enough but just press it down and then fold it and continue to fold it in the bottom just to make sure it sticks and there you have it I'm gonna set it down for a second talk its press it down for a second just to continue to get the bottom down in there but there you have it you're finished big lighter to seal this field it's shiny it's pretty it works but there you have it that is how easy it is to make your very own big lighter

been in there probably oh I think over seven hours so I wanted to do a test because on the first one I let it go for like two minutes or two and a half minutes before I lit it so this one I'm going to try to light right out of the freezer it's right here look at all the food in there it's a little windy it's not light maybe it's too windy from the fam I know I can hear the gasps Oh now I'm warming it up with my hands there it goes warming it up with my hands again I can hear the gas I hope the camera is picking it up keep in mind this has been in there for seven hours probably over seven hours there it goes so we're about two two minutes in and also this one is almost empty this is an empty Vic now the camera shows it is blue but this is actually purple it must be the lighting okay so you definitely have to warm them up with your hands okay I wanted to do one more test because this electronic bit and see now it's purple this electronic BIC is going to be almost empty so I want to do one more harsh test so okay so there it's lighting we have pretty good pressure here you can see the water this definitely get a little saturated so I'm gonna see if it lights okay so this is a very extreme test I just ran out of time on my memory card so about two minutes ago I did this test and ran out right at the highlight so this this thing is really gonna be run through the ringer it's not lighting because it just went through a test okay there it's lighting okay and then I got a simulate the test again so this thing's just it got doused like this just about two minutes ago like they could see that the water is definitely going through the night is fun and remember that it did light just a second ago and it went through a test just like this now this lighter is almost empty that's why I wanted to run this one through some more heavy-duty testing because they I notice with these big lighters they don't work a hundred percent when they're getting near empty okay so hopefully the light again just like it did before I started the test it doesn't sound like it's gonna light I think I might have killed it this time oh there it goes okay so look at that and you notice that I did not use a towel dry it off this time okay so that anyway that's why the two videos are separated because I ran out of time on the first card oops okay so I've kind of wrapped up not a hundred percent but for right now I wrapped up the testing of the big lighters and I've been doing this for about oh I think three weeks now and I started with the classic picks and then I stepped up to the electronic pick actually the one that just fell is the one that passed a lot of the tests I think almost all of them so this is the electronic ignition bic lighter and they run a little bit more expensive than the classic but this one as you probably saw in some of the videos already did very well on a lot of the tests it's getting kind of worn out it's almost empty but it's still lighting this trigger feels like it's starting to stick so yeah see now it's not clicking you know it's almost shot but there it's lightning so how it's it's almost gone but it has been put through the wringer and maybe it'll dry out in a couple days to where this is smooth again so this is a good one and if you're thinking about using bic lighters for your bug out bag definitely get an electronic ignition one this is the mini I think I'm gonna go ahead and get the full-size one because the only thing I don't like about the mini so you would get the light again is it burns my thumb like if you go like that out and with these they're not that bad the classic picks don't burn your finger is bad so that's the one thing I do not like about the electronic dick lighters so if you want to use these for your bug out bag definitely get one of these and then I would say have two full classic picks in your bug out bag just for your backup lighter just in case this ignition system doesn't work and actually it is already starting to fail because it's not it's starting to stick so this is my main concern with this type of lighter is is that electronic ignition so if that goes out at least you have your classic picks and they have to be full because they work a lot better when they're full so anyway that's the video so far and I'm going to start comparing Vic lighters to some other fire starters but these are so in expensive and I've run them through these tests and I'm definitely going to put them in my bug-out back because they're not extremely heavy and it's still a very proven way to get a fire", "mcg6mau4rGc": "it's a case for combustion spin the wheel and you have an instant flame flip the lid and the flame is extinguished a version of the lighter first appeared in the 19th century at the time it was more of a conversation piece than anything a curiosity that ignited plenty of interest lighters aren't a novelty anymore but there's still a hot commodity to make lighter cases a machine and coils brass from a spool pulling it to a press the press stamps the brass repeatedly to shape both the top and bottom parts of the case a worker collects them and places them on a revolving table another worker slides on a hinge to link the top and bottom pieces an electrode welds the hinge to the case then a mechanical arm knocks them down a chute to a worker who inspects the welding job as the cases move on a conveyor system they get a quick buff to prepare them for plating the lighter cases are now plunged into a series of washing solutions and rinses followed by a nickel solution then a chrome one it's the finishing touch for the lighter cases it's time to move on to the inner workings a dye shapes a piece of steel to make the inside cases mechanised arms then place a tube and plate in the case the tube will hold the Flint stone and the plate who will form the top of the inner case the epoxy seals them in place and the cases move through a curing oven to harden the epoxy a worker range is a pile of Flint wheels so that the teeth are in the proper direction grippers load the Flint wheels into an assembly jig these cams will eventually act as a catch for the lighter lid a grip replaces the cam in the jig beside the Flint wheel the assembly jig now receives little brass eyelets between the Flint wheel and the camp the machine slides the inner case over the Flint wheel cam and eyelet and an automated device rivets it all together a machine lowers awake to the eyelet and threads it through blades move in from the side and snip the wick this machine stuffs pieces of cotton into the inner case the cotton will soak up and retain fuel when the consumer adds it later steel plungers tamp down the wick and cotton here add I punch cuts a piece of felt to sighs automated arms pick up the felt and shove it into the top of the inner case here grippers place a flint spring in the case just over the Flintstone pneumatic screwdrivers drive the screw home a rubber wheel spins the flint and sparks fly as a light sensor checks their intensity after the Flint check technicians install the inner unit in the case they check the fit they test the function looks like it's an open-and-shut case", "Q2Vj90t0I6A": "[Music] hey guys it's jayjay with reality survival calm and today what I'm gonna talk to you about is a few ways to use a regular thick lighter if it happens to be out of fluid and it's not working for you to start a fire in the normal way the way that its intended and I want to show you a few ways you can use it out in the wilderness in a survival situation so okay so if you've got your big lighter and it happens to be out of fuel and you know old are not working or whatever as this one is see here is it it won't light but it does still put out a spark alright you can use that to your advantage in small situation to still start a fire a pretty easy way to use this is to go ahead and strip the metal top off very carefully and take off the little safety wire so that it looks like this and as you can see it'll spark pretty well okay so the way you want to prepare this to get it ready to go is just take a little bit of your cotton ball and Vaseline and kind of form it into a little circle there and you want to place it up behind it where it's going to catch that spark and then start a student spark into it and there you go set that down with the rest of your fire and you're good to go pretty cool but you can also use a bit lighter for several other things so let me go ahead and pull this apart and I'll show you what else you can do with it okay so the usable parts in this like I said are gonna be that little fire steel and then there are a couple of Springs inside of here as well and then you also have the body of the lighter itself which as I showed you the other day in the fire starters video anything that's plastic could be used by making shavings to start a fire so when you're pulling this thing apart here that steel is under pressure so you really got to be careful with it because it will go flying so if you start by just rolling that roller wheel over to the side keeping your finger right on top where it's sitting and you'll catch that steel when it tries to come out of there you really got to watch it because it is under a lot of pressure on that little little spring okay so that fire steel it's not very big obviously and trying to use it like a regular fire steel or metal match with just your fingers is very difficult it is possible this spring here it's about a two inch spring and that could also be used in a number of different situations perhaps to create a snare or fish hook or something along those lines and then you have also have another spring up underneath here be careful when you're pulling these things apart and there's that spring so again that could be used for a small fish hook or something like that as well so there you go those are mostly usable parts the safety strap here might be able to be used to strike this deal okay so this two-inch steel steel spring we also said is usable and the way that we're going to do that is we're going to stretch it out so leaving a couple of coils on the end I'm just going to grab that pull it stretch it out and as you can see it's pretty long [Music] what you can do then is you can take it and try to run over [Music] stick or anything else like that hopefully try to straighten it out a little bit now it'll take a few minutes to get it into the shape of the snare we've got to kind of work with it and toy with it but essentially you'll be able to see later how that's formed out and we said you get a good you know 10 inch piece of wire there that you can actually use to make a little squirrel snare so it's pretty useful could also use it to make a fishing hook or something along those lines but that spring is what makes it useful for making snares and I'll show you how here in just a little a little bit okay the other thing you can do with these little Springs is you can fashion them into a little fish hook I've just taken this spring pulled it stretched it out and I have fashioned it into a very small little fishhook and then I took the Leatherman and on the end I just repeatedly like that sharpened up a little bit and as you can see it's pretty sharp it's grabbing my skin you know of as a fish's mouth comes over it it's definitely going to be strong enough for a small fish and it's gonna hook onto him pretty well you wouldn't want to jerk it too hard but it could be effective and you could make you know probably four or five hooks out of that so all right now let's see what the squirrel snare looks like I don't know tree you can take the spring that was underneath that fire steal that one there that still coiled up about two inches long or so and you can actually fashion that into a little squirrel snare it took me a couple of minutes to get this all straightened out and everything but what you want to do with these is you want to find a pole okay and what I've done is I've just taken this old pole here and I've leaned it up against this big tree all right now ideally what you're looking for here is a tree that's got a couple squirrels nests in it or something along those lines and squirrels just like humans are by nature lazy so instead of running all the way to the ground they'll use these little squirrel poles because it's at a nice 45-degree angle keeps them above the brush they tend to travel on quite a bit so let me show you how to fix this thing so that you can catch something to eat okay so once you've got your pole in place the next thing you're gonna do is you're going to straighten that wire out and spring out and you want to take it and make it so that it'll just naturally relax into a position that's about the size of your finger and then when you stretch it out you want to stretch it out and kind of provide a little bump there so that it's under tension okay so now you can see that I got about two sides to finger size and when this world goes through there if he just twitches it it's going to tighten up on him just like that and I've caught a bunch of squirrels like this it seems kind of crazy and simple but it actually works so you get it under tension then just a little hair bump will tighten it up around its neck alright so then [Music] I think this world's gonna find you if you need to okay so that is now positioned on that log so that when a squirrel comes down there you're going to you there's some ants on it as well they're gonna very likely run right through the middle of that log so they're gonna run down from from a tree come down this pole and they're gonna go through right the center of that little snare and just like I was showing you earlier it's under tension so when they struggle through it it'll tighten up around their neck and they will flop around and hang there and choke themselves and then you've got dinner and you can actually do you know several of these along a pole if you have enough wire you would you would ideally you know want to try to run you know four or five six of them if you had the wire and the resources you get that out of the vehicle you know or a junk pile or just anywhere you can come by it and set several these poles around you know and then check them every 12 hours or so depending on the temperature you might want to check them more often if it's hot but especially in the wintertime in areas where the squirrels don't like to get in some deep snow this is gonna work out really well for you and and it's it's a good way to catch dinner it's pretty simple [Music] [Music]", "-Syvy2z1q8c": "all right um so I can get in a couple asks on my tumblr and stuff like that about how I make the custom lighters that I do so I just decided that I'm gonna make a tutorial video showing how to make them because I figured that's the best way um so the first thing I'm gonna do is go over everything you need and the prices of what those supplies cost so the first thing you're gonna need is for sliders and whatever amount you don't want you can see I like the small one and the larger one um the smaller ones are slightly cheaper but for a regular full-size bic lighter it's gonna be about a dollar lighter that's kind of the most expensive aspect um yeah if you buy like a couple more like if you buy a pack of like five it'll be cheaper than if you just keep buying you know a pack of one if you're just but if you're just making one which I figure most people do um then that'll be fine it'll be about a dollar the next thing you're gonna need is a glue stick and it kind of doesn't matter like if you have whatever kind of glue stick um just as long as it's not super cheap as in like it won't stick it off but I don't know this is probably like 50 cents or something like that and then the next thing you're gonna need is a large punch and I use the gloss finish and I'm pretty sure this entire eight ounce container was uh I think I almost say like about four dollars I could be a little off on that but it's about four dollars I want to say and I think I'm only like I've only used like up to here and I you know made a bunch of stuff with this so yeah that's not too bad oh the next thing I didn't use a paintbrush and it could be any kind of paintbrush but I do suggest that you be careful not to buy because I started using originally like just these cheap paint brushes I had but I learned that the color off this paintbrush and I had some that were other colors as well was uh I was like mixing with the modge podge and it was kind of like smearing that color so I bought some like white ones so that wouldn't happen anymore oh yeah the only thing I suggest is that you get it about like a good a good size to cover the lighter because if you get one see like this small you know it take forever to finish the next thing you're gonna need okay much uh you know it's probably a couple of them I bought all of these I can get this last one all of these and I want to say it was like three or four dollars and the next thing is you're gonna um need your artwork and if you don't have a printer you can see about printing it at your school or maybe at the library um or friends maybe but I just use my home printer that I have and I just printed it on regular copy paper and the another important thing you're gonna need to remember is when printing it you're gonna need to print the measurements I would suggest somewhere between two point seven zero and two point seven five inches just because that's about what it takes to cover the lighter and um this is a square a square design that what's what seems to work best even though not the entire design will fit but I'll forget that I'll get into that when I demonstrate it going right um so that's everything you're gonna need and of course everything except the lighter and the image you can use over and over again if you're making more than one so that's good um so yeah the first thing you're gonna need to do is like I said print out your image and then you're gonna need to get to the right measurements and then the fruit and the next thing I do after I print it out and cut out the basic you know design I start to position it around the lighter and I'll make sure it's matching up and if there's something that needs a little little fixing I've done most of this already so I don't really have anything to show but you uh you line it up and you know you know sale something was a little too long you could you could take it down cut it off but I've done that already so um the next thing you're gonna do flip your design over go stick just cover the back completely I'm sure there are other ways people have done this I've seen someone just take it take the design and take a bunch of clear tape and just wrap it around but I I tried that once and it didn't seem to work it just wasn't as good it looked a lot cheaper and not as good because I guess it was quick um so then after you got the glue all over the back and it's nice and sticky you're gonna you're gonna place it on the lighter carefully make sure it's not crooked and I just get the main front design down and that's that's just what I go off of cuz it's the most important part and then there's gonna be an overlap like the one side is gonna overlap the other so I pick whichever side I'd want to show more and I want to show the part that has a balance and composure right there so I'll fold the side I care less about down first carefully pushing it down nice and solid and then just to ensure that uh I get a nice stick on the overlap I'll grab the glue stick and just cover this part again and then I'll usually just take the palm of my hand and just fold it into it so it's nice and uh and click oh I'm just realizing then I left a little bit of white right there so peel it up real fast well it's still wet grab my scissors no much trim there go fast some up on the top - well that wasn't very careful alright um so just give me a second well I mixed this up alright all better so uh I'll go back and repeat what I've just done just to make sure it's nice and steamy then I'll fold it fold it and then I'll just stick it down and so you've got that that is pretty much the hardest step I would say and once you've got that all down then it's it's pretty easy from there the biggest concern is just trying to make sure you don't have any bubbles or creases that you don't want so the next step visit your March Punjab grab your paintbrush and also you don't want to do this step or kind of the other stuff as well immediately after printing your design because if the ink is wet on the paper it'll kind of smear but this was printed a while back so I'm good to go so you just want to start with like downward strokes you don't want to go all over the place because you can also smear it so I could start with the area now you can see that it's a see it's bleeding under the paintbrush so you need to be careful not to smear it but I like to start with the part that overlaps just because I feel like if I can get a nice secure gloss over it it'll help it stick so you just kind of do a lot of downward strokes just being careful not to smear going nice and slow covering every part of it I've never had I've never done a lighter that didn't smear at least a little bit but uh no maybe there's another method to where it wouldn't smear at all but it's not it's it's it's a holding up pretty well [Music] yeah so once you've got it nice and covered your the next thing you're gonna want to do is uh just sit and let it dry and uh while that dries it doesn't take too long to let it dry so while that's drying I'm just gonna go wash out my paintbrush and then I'll continue back", "Zw4a8oi66NE": "hi guys grad here in this video I want to talk about the BIC metal series so these are just your basic big mini lighters and they make a housing for them that has a spring L lid sort of in a Zippo style the big mini the slides right in and it gives it a more elegant case you know heavier in your pocket and just makes it a little bit nicer that's something that you're interested in one thing to note is that the lid does kind of get in the way of the flame of health at a certain angle this is the larger of the two versions that they make they actually make several different designs I've had this version with a smooth design one this sort of has a border and then little old grooves like perfectly spaced or whatever running up and down and then this one here sort of has grooves without a border and there I don't know haphazardly spaced I don't know how to describe that it has a little hole on the bottom I assume that so when you go to remove or replace the big mini there there isn't a vacuum that's created in here I don't really think it's exactly that airtight anyway that it would create a vacuum but it's a neat design feature it has a little piece of metal on here that sort of been out to help hold the dick mini in place so they put some thought and time into these this is the other version they come in this sort of dark gray and then a silver color about like that and it's just sort of a more slim form-fitting version of the same thing it has a neuro-link and this is clearly some sort of coating that's applied to the metal what's interesting about these is that they're not available in America they're made available in Europe the near and Middle East Africa and Oceania however the internet being the great thing that it is makes it available to anyone who wants to pay for it and this is like thank you for like twelve to fourteen dollars actually I think this one's about twelve dollars for some reason and this one's about seven dollars so you get them in like a set of two on Amazon or Ebay I just thought these were pretty neat I said I had a bunch of these I've given them a lot of them away so this is the only design that I have left right now you know they're really neat really nifty and they're they're cheap enough you know 14 bucks for two and get a few of these and hand them to your buddies or if you're out somewhere and somebody's like oh wow that's really cool I haven't seen anything like that gonna be like here have it and suddenly you're the cool dude so thanks for watching", "2EO7DOsUcbA": "everyone are you guys doing [Music] so today we have here a sequel you can see

to use it to make fire lay down a tissue and slowly spin the thumbwheel without making it spark after a few minutes you'll gather a small amount of Flint bunch it up together and twist the tissue with the Flint inside now using the lighter spark up the tissue and the Flint will cause it to ignite now you have fire to survive the night and that's how to revive a dead lighter have a mini hack you'd like me to do leave it in the comments stay tuned for more 30 second mini acts every week", "o1oaoDGslmE": "yo what's up YouTube today I'm gonna do a review on clipper lighters vs big lighters versus cricket lighters so among these three crickets are usually the cheapest one they're like mmm cheapest you can get a few for a buck this one is usually a dollar and then this one is a bit more expensive mmm the key features is so we're going to compare these two first first off is the flame height and the cool feature about a clipper is that when you tilt it the flame goes higher and a bit hotter the flame height of a cricket is always set to maximum is actually one of their special special features is always set to max so you always get a big flame but it's not a consistent swing if the gas is low it will go down as well as for the big lighter no matter how low the gas is it will always be this fixed height right here and it's for the Clipper I'm also sure about that I haven't tried a clipper till I finished it actually so another key feature of the clipper is that it's semi pthrough so semi-translucent so you can always see how much gas you got left and these two are usually opaque in with solid colors the Clippers and bigs usually have really fun designs and the crickets are usually one solid design alright so if let's say you were using this to light your cigarettes or any anything else I would suggest you try a clipper first versus the big because even though these two use filtered butane equipment I feel personally tastes a bit lighter less harsh when when you light anything with it so I would I would sway towards clipper as for the crickets crickets are really harsh whatever you light it with but they're very easy to light because there's so light on the the Flint wheel compared to these two which brings me to my second point which is the click wheel the Flint wheel actually so Clippers will use a pentagonal shape you use the round shape focus these you use this around generic shape alright and the last final special feature of the Clipper is that it's got this poker so it's used to poke a joints or you can use it to poke your pipes and pack up compact the tobacco in there and you can replace this and the Flint inside and it's refillable can't say the same for the big or the cricket all right outside helps you with this decision making and your next lighter purchase that I could help thanks guys peace out", "vbpivmzCTW8": "today's text spot will be having a look at the Ignite lighters rechargeable USB lighter you it is the lighter reinvented spot actually found this I think I found it at Canadian Tire no if we have Canadian Tire and do you guys have Canadian Tire North America but I'm sure they're available in other places as well this is a rechargeable USB lighter it costs spot roughly about fourteen dollars and though I don't spot really truthfully doesn't smoke the idea of using a lighter for other practical reasonings for you know candles or anything else it's always good to have it the idea of charging with a with a USB interests me quite a bit on the side of the package it says ignite lighters you can go ignite lighters calm up at the top there it is no flame all weather and all weather resistant on the back the lighter re-invented no flame no fuel all weather rechargeable of course as always we want to keep this out of reach of children because still it is essentially a lighter you don't want to be you know having kids get access to something like that but what I am going to do is I'm going to get this opened up and when we come back we're going to get better look at the Ignite lighters definitely more heading your way guys don't go anywhere stay tuned included with the ignite lighter you get of course yourself a little manual very straightforward it just tells you how to operate and how to charge your your USB ignite later when you know when it needs to be charged by the way also when you charge it just going to pull the end of your USB lighter and pull this end off plug this into your computer it takes approximately an hour to fully charge it and from that single charge you're going to get roughly a hundred lights so you're you're actually going to get quite a bit out of it it's not something where you're going to always need to have it plugged in and then just be pulling it out when you need a lighter so I mean you can get a full charge one hundred little you know one hundred lights is quite substantial for for this so I'll just move the manual out of the way so essentially the starters it's a very heavy piece it's a lot heavier in fact than what I was expecting to to operate you can have this little arrow at let's zoom in so you guys can see it see this little arrow right here you're going to put your thumb or really any finger and you're just going to bring it down so you bring it down you're going to notice the element up at the top here light up and watch watch this spot just pulls this down you can see right away that that lights up now you may think yourself hey that's just the light but no it actually creates a substantial amount of heat I would put it on par with probably a smaller almost stove element in fact reaching off-camera so that you guys can see that this is truly a lighter spot went with the most pathetic candle but just enough to show you that it does work I'm going to just light this put it to the candle put it to the candle oh and you can see it is lighting the candle but a bang but a boom we have fire I think that is I think that's pretty incredible the fact that this is in a lighter format again it's not going to have any fuel so you're not to worry about refilling this or the fact that you can be spending fifteen dollars on a portable lighter and then when the fuel runs out you can have to buy a new one all everything is contained inside beam it's all electric you know the only thing that's preventing you from from lighting something else is how much juice you have left in the Ignite lighter when again when you're done you can plug it into your USB port and you have a hundred lights quite an incredible piece of technology and it's one of those things that you're trying to think of what to get somebody who has it all even if you're not to say that people should be still smoking but certainly if you know somebody that is a smoker this would also make a fun gift idea as well today's tech spot we're having a look at the ignite lighters rechargeable USB lighter and just like that we have light thanks for watching guys it's early stay tuned spots got more tech spots heading your way I'll see you guys next time you", "dPj-s1sLSEc": "say hello to the most badass lighter in the world welcome to the plasmatic eggs so in just looking at the packaging you know that this product means business it's straight to the point it's luxurious and let me just say taking this out for the first time I was blown away I mean picking this up this is unlike any lighter I've ever held in my hands before but then again judging by its price of forty nine ninety five US dollars you'd kind of expect it to be four lighter that is a lot of money there's a whole range of exteriors you can actually go for but being the classy guy am I've gone for a nice wood finish which I don't regret one bit so the really cool thing about this product is it charges via USB what that means is you're never gonna have to worry about getting more lighter fluid there's no nasty chemicals you just plug it in wait an hour and you've got a hundred lights worth of battery in there and then it actually comes to using it and this thing looks drop-dead gorgeous it is one of the coolest gadgets I think I've ever seen in my entire life oh yeah it also works a charm to the point to which the two lasers cross is heated to a temperature of 900 degrees Fahrenheit that means it can basically obliterate anything you put inside of it that's things like matches fireworks cigarettes all the things you'd expect delights to do but even if you shove a piece of plastic in there you'll probably only see it for about three seconds the way that the plasmatic ex is built alongside all its other features means it's also wind proof and water resistant making this the one lighter to kill them all the only thing worth bearing in mind and the only real negative I can really see in this product is just the price I mean if you're willing to fork out forty nine ninety five and you're a regular user of lighters then I can honestly say that considering it's going to literally last you a lifetime and it feels and looks amazing to use this thing is insane you", "oNc8FrsM-68": "thank you for joining our YouTube channel I

something I've been meaning to do a video on for a while and that is this beautiful invention called the lighter fire immediate fire at your disposal literally the drawback is that these are none or fillable as far as I know even if they were I don't think I'd mess around with it because the price dollar $69 $50 sometimes every time I'm at a hardware store or something like that I buy a five pack so I have a bunch of these I have some in the car in the house and every backpack that I have in every coat one drawback with this style of lighter is that if it gets wet it will work again but it takes a while to dry out and if you just got wet and you need to get warm quickly that could be an issue one side note before we begin on this little experiment over here this is not a bit lighter and this I don't mean for this to be a commercial for BIC however if you've had any experience with lighters then you'll know that it's not worth buying the cheapest they're crap yeah it does light but it's garbage they're just not as reliable as Bix so as you can see this is one wet layer nice I know some tricks from my childhood I also just watch a few videos on YouTube about how to get a wet lighter to work again so they are good to have even if you don't put them in something waterproof however like I said those tricks that I learned like blowing out this area here get all the water out letting it air dry which I usually had to do whenever I got one wet and it would take upwards of an hour depending on how dry your environment is and other ideas you put it on dry cloth like jeans or something and roll it this way on the striker and engage the striker like this not supposed to dry it out that's the one that I knew even as a child and even sometimes that didn't work so you can see this clearly is no lady you see my videos before you'll know that I'm a huge fan of Ranger bands and herein lies one of the solutions this is not entirely my idea however the way of attaching this to my lighter I think is unique I have been looking for the past few days I haven't seen anything like it there are quite a few people squeezing this over the top here so this tight fitting there's some left over here and they put a grommet ring in there so you can attach it to your key chain so you can put it in this way Recker side or this way so you can immediately use your lighter however my concern was to waterproof lighter or at least make it watertight that's what I've done it's taken a piece of Ranger band aka bicycle tire tube this one in particular is for road bicycles it's a lot smaller you know that to be imax tubes or the mountain bike tubes are quite a bit larger than this this one fits the best on a regular size bit lighter and this is what I've done here so squeeze it on the end here over the top be careful not to have the tab depressed and leaking gas out you can easily remedy that by just making sure it's not being squeezed and you're not wasting all your gas so you squeeze that on the end there fold it over and then put another smaller strip here and here's the idea put the regular run back in let's try the cheapy might as well throw it in and this is a mini I found that even works well on a mini mini bik there we go supersaturated I soak in there for a few more seconds we all know that Ranger band also burns very well burns black it burns when it's wet and it burns ferociously so it's good tinder if you have enough of it it's good for signal and it's good for rubber bands there we go that's adequately soaked I'm sure that guy there all right there are all of our lighters let's blow this gp1 out some people actually go the other way than blowing they say to suck the water out I'm not sure if there's the difference this is what no spark no flame pick again no spark no flame now these guys do a little feller first another cool thing about this part of the band here you can see that's separate that's another piece altogether you could put your line' a lanyard line through that it's always a good idea to put a dummy cord on stuff if you're you're gonna have it in a little survival pouch or something and you don't want to drop it in the forest so here we are make sure my thumb is dry let's dry it off on my floor on fire so I may be exaggerating here a bit when I say that could be a lifesaver however if you did take a dump in the river and it is cold and you do need to get dry immediately this could be a perfect remedy for that here we go with this one fire there we are not entirely my idea I think I did put a twist on the mod this stuff's very inexpensive to get you can go buy a tube or you can go to your local bike store and say hey do you have any tubes it you've changed recently that are flat that you're throwing away if they don't say hang on to some for me give me a shout when you do most bike shop places they're pretty cool guys so they'll do that for you so there you go I hope you like that little mod and thanks for watching guys I'll catch you later", "BR8vzXF7gAo": "hey guys Paul here from Brad bushcraft so I'm gonna be doing a quick video about which lighter I think is best the BIC versus the Clipper so don't go away alright so let me start with the thick it's pretty much been my go-to lighter in my whole life I've never been a fan of the Zippos and some of the other lighters that you can get around here like the super cheap disposable ones but the BIC I find it's a pretty reliable lighter it's easy to use and it's it's just been my go-to lighter the the only thing is with the BIC you can't refill it once once it's done you throw it away it's garbage and I've noticed in the last 20 years or so it made a few changes where I'm not I'm not fond of the they added the old childproof thing at the top I usually pop it off it's it's not doesn't make that much of a difference to use but I find it just a little easier to use without it so I usually pop it off and then the other thing too there used to be years ago a little wheel here where you could adjust the flame and they don't do that anymore so it's still a good lighter it's better it's what I've been using for years so but I find the older style like 20 years ago we're a little bit better than they are today you can also get them in a smaller size which some people like better for myself I like the bigger bit better I find the smaller ones are a little more awkward to handle so I this is usually the size I go with I usually picked a bright color that's easier to find if I drop it so that's the BIC the drawbacks you can't refill it once it's done you throw it away you can usually get them for usually a doll or something by themselves to around a doll or if you buy like a pack of four you can usually buy like a pack of or for around $4 give or take a bit so they are fairly cheap around $1 each so been using them my whole life good throw away later so recently I found out about the Clipper and I checked on Amazon I seen there I think I bought a pack of 4 for $10 so a little more expensive than the BIC but the nice thing with these is that you can refill them you can actually pop the Flint out and if the lighters garbage still use the flint without the lighter which is pretty neat in a survival situation and you can also replace the flint which is a pretty cool feature if you ask me the flint is a little more like hexagon style which I don't mind some people I heard don't like it as much I weigh I it doesn't bother me at all but the other really neat feature I like about the Clipper is if you light it and you turn it sideways the flame goes up a bit really nice for starting fires so a really good feature so for a bit more money I can fill this up I don't know how many times but it's a really good feature that I can't buy fluid and keep refilling this light or over and over again as in the back I'm throwing it away and the really nice thing about that is is if I'm going on a camping trip or hiking or something and I'm gonna be doing like two three nights overnight in the woods I can pop it up right before I leave so that I know it's gonna be good for my entire trip or if some happens I know I got a full lighter as in the bit if I'm going on a big camping trip and I got a big that's like half full or a quarter I'll usually leave it at home and buy a new one so it's kind of a little more of a hassle so real big plus about the clipper now for size comparison they're pretty much the same size the clipper is a tiny bit smaller and both comfortable to keep in your pocket so no real advantage there so after using the Clipper for a few months I have to say I do like it better than the BIC just the fact that you can refill it you can change the Flint take it out it's just such a nice lighter just the the flame thing when you tip it over it makes it easier to start fires in the woods so for me I'm uh I'm sold so for now from now on I'm carrying a clipper when I go camping and the BIC well sorry BIC you've served me well for years but I have to say that the Clipper is the superior lighter for me anyway maybe you have reasons that you like the bit better if you do let me know in a comment I'd love I'd love to hear why you think the BIC might be better than the Clipper but I am surprised that we don't see the Clipper in North America more than we do I had to go on Amazon to find it I heard you can get him in like specialty tobacco shops and stuff but I for me I just order it on Amazon I just wish I could have picked I'd better pick up a color what color where I could have took a color that's a little more bright so in case if I drop it it's easier to find and a color where I can see the fluid and lighter but no big deal it's still I got a four pack for ten dollars so very good little lighter I'm very impressed and I can see why all you Europeans really love the clipper it's it's a very good lighter and the fact that you don't have to throw it away you can keep refilling it it's very well done you can also get like premium Clippers that come in stainless steel and all that better better quality and everything so I'm gonna look into that also and see if I can find one of those although I don't want to spend twenty bucks on a lighter because if I do lose it and you kind of feel a little more crappy about it and you lose a lighter that's a couple bucks no big deal you can just replace it well there you go guys just a quick review on the new clipper compared to the BIC for me the Clipper wins that's just my go-to lighter from now on and thank you for mentioning this to me about the Clipper because I had no idea about them so it's really to find out about this little later very happy I tried it and I'm going to stick with it and keep using it so thank you very much for watching please like comment and subscribe and until next time guys I'll see you all out in the woods", "B2xAZaHdQvI": "hey everybody a little bit of uh a differ from the norm today but uh i backed a kickstarter for this dissim lighter quite a while ago but it i think it was like about 45 dollars for the the pouch and the lighter the pouch uh kind of got crushed and you know when it was being shipped or whatever but no big deal um so let's take a look i got a can of butane because i did not order the butane that came with it and uh here we go let's unbox it and see how it looks now uh i basically i don't smoke anymore but i i guess i'm gonna have to rip this open i um you know appreciate a good lighter i used to just use zippo lighters like almost exclusively and then i started just using bix so personally i think for like two bucks it's really going to be hard to beat the old bic lighter um i kind of bought this because i'm interested in the flippiness of it i guess but well let's just get into it and see what it's like so has a nice box really thick cardboard actually feels pretty good um and here we go looks like there's something behind that lighter feels very nice very solid say okay spin it yeah that's cool um you know if you were to be lighting a particular kind of uh thing with this well we'll get into it with the flame but i don't see how it could be that much better than this but yeah so on here we have silica and the instructions whoopee so i'd like i said i don't remember when i backed this it was a while ago it was definitely before i moved to where i am now so here's the uh hole to put in the butane i believe i i read about it last night i got this last night but i didn't open it um but i think you're supposed to hold for five seconds so okay and uh i guess we'll give it a shake or something let's see how it goes ready one two three nothing nothing hmm maybe i should have read the directions let's turn the flame up come on turn it all the way to minimum then what the are you kidding me all right i'll put in a little more oh i can hold it different way you are kidding all right well let's turn to the directions hold the water sideways so the fuel valve is pointing upwards okay release the fuel tank pressure by using a small screwdriver or similar tool pressing down into the fuel inlet valve until all pressure is released okay turn it all the way to minus there we go with the fuel valve still pointing upwards insert the tip of an m the butane tank directly into there and push down for five seconds so here we go again third time's the charm right wait four minutes before igniting the wider to allow excess butane to evaporate and the gas inside the lighter to reach room temperature really well it's cold so you know what yeah i'll wait the four minutes i'm wow this video is already for five minutes long well you know what you know what while we're here we'll take a look at the uh little pouch so this was a little add-on i think i can't remember this i backed this so long ago this is actually also the first uh kickstarted thing that i've ever backed so see it's kind of nice that the zipper is like invisible it's kind of interesting got this little cover over it and the lighter should just uh [Applause] i don't really know what the point of this would be but it's uh something kind of gets hung up on the uh that wheel depending on how much way you face it so i guess we'll put it in this way no not too bad that's a interesting texture i almost don't like it the texture of it kind of rough yeah i could have i couldn't take this or leave it blah blah i will leave it and not use it um the lighter this is plastic this feels like uh aluminum or something does it scratch easy let's see yes so this has some kind of paint over it i guess and uh yeah it's scratched already there you go right i mean do we have to wait a full four minutes it's already been another minute it's already been about two minutes let's see really all right shake it is it i mean seriously am i missing something simply press down the ignition switch to ignite the flame never hold the ignition switch for the continuous flame for more than 10 seconds all right well let's let's turn it up oh let's turn it up all the way turn it up and rip the knob off can i even hear the gas hold on yes i can hear gas coming up all right well we've got another one minute to wait so um while i'm kind of just sitting here thinking i mean was this worth buying over this i don't think so i uh i'm a little bit getting a little annoyed actually i'm it just like it didn't really it's not really that it took that long to get here is that it just arrived and it's not seeming to work um let's look at that little stuff on the back so we got a patent-pending circle grip lifetime warranty and refillable very patent-pending ergonomic circle grip this time flame adjustment angled flame port there's nothing to adjust here i guess it's probably for just getting air in there all right so that's all the way minus hello and that's all the way uh you know what let's see if this part scratches too yep i wonder if that's clear under there i don't know i can't really tell my might be but anyways all right let's uh it should be at room temperature now it's been about four minutes this is all right i'm gonna release the pressure i could wait can i see it in there all right i'm gonna release the pressure one more time and try it again and then uh i'm gonna say that it came broken oh yeah there's the there's the butane come on god that's cold all right one more time okay not here we'll even test to make sure it went in ready yep it's in there all right i'll come back in four minutes and if it doesn't work this time well hopefully that warranty is not too bad okay it's been four minutes so this is my last try one i'll even put my middle finger through it one two three i can see a little spark in there too i'm not sure what the i saw it for a second you know here you need a little help there buddy whoa holy that's a huge flame okay now it's whistling i don't like that i'll be right back all right so i uh took it outside and released the uh butane turned down the fuel and uh this is it let's see bullet light nope oh there's a little flame there oh there it is so with assistance the dism lighter will light with another with another lighter um yeah i i'm pretty disappointed honestly i waited a long time for this lighter and it doesn't even work whoa yeah that's it for the uh dissim lighter i don't know if that flame got flame up got caught on camera but um yeah we're distant if you watch the if you're watching this i'm gonna send you an email and i want it to be fixed under warranty thanks have a good day", "zQsyBaQwyS8": "what's up Angie business like I said when I'm back with another video and today I'm gonna show you a lot of collection and a how many pressing videos that's because I've been a huge holiday at goal Christ board beach so yeah before you watch this video my lighter collection make sure you subscribe to my channel and give this video a thumbs up let's pair onto it so my first slider you can get these for 49 cents yeah dudes light up not refillable just one now this is actually quite a special one because I made it to a flame girl pretty hot so everybody usually he's a lotta but our video on that go check that out the next to you like fire dragons they cool I like them you're like just you know wide your frame and then and then one of my next favorite ones full-auto I've got one here it's probably the biggest flame one pretty cool next one this is like a medium sized one let's put my second panel linguicism inside of gasps yeah and then you got my little one go add the biggest thing out of that big one and I'll see I've got a bit clutter I put a hook on it just up and go inside my belt on that little gadget no water and another cool thing is that what a medium sized pick lighter so that's I sort of comedian the difference so that's big thought a big bit clutter medium and then funny thing is I bought us more now this one doesn't work but I use it as a survival tool as when it's got actually a pretty big fluent spot you probably can't see on the camera but uh that's a medium-sized one so I go all the big something you can get bigger ones then big one over here yeah I don't Marc Benson I've got these for a dollar either this is a new one I've gotten at my holiday it's got a little koala and this is Australia at the bottom and this is another one I got this one it says Australia it's just got the signs that we've got here I have got crops I mean yeah I'm just gonna go through my new ones that I've gotten what else my god I got this one here it's a zipper and I've actually got this a lot of food zipper a lot of food I brought that on the holiday so that's always one of that meal in the port is needs bagel and I just got that working says a lot all right over to stinks like friggin crazy I like it I'm gonna favorite zippered just a dragon yeah so that's really cool it's $30 but it was matte black one and it was like smooth was gonna kick so I really run down and I just got the spell one this doesn't work you go looking line one likkle mm I'm from the brain cricket bot is another one from the brand Kirk that line is I don't know what that says on it it was like it was so Bharati in it but yeah I've also got zip a lottery pool in gasps ooh for beating those 80 it's a cheap shot that's really cool Bob online already seven dollars ago they said it's tobacco shop really still flame I like it it's cool it's really hard to stand up in the water show off with some the height one this one does not work at all because I got up from TSG I got this really cool one inside blows oh wow get something really big but the lock thing I like about this one is that it actually flicks up cuz mash them you gotta like you don't manually but this one just mix up that's pretty cool that's another Farrell muscles to give it to me a blowtorch you just refilled that one go into a lot of heck does this one use or just as you can see I put a wire and eats that wire and you can cut through ever you want and also have another one as I've got this lot of you you and made into a crossbar know what you do is you meant a lot the match and then you just take it out whatever but uh lot of Lex then it just do like that and it actually puts the matching fire you press press the peg down what's it going to pause it that's pretty cool I've got a puppy done one better comment in my other videos saying puppy dogs maybe that was wrong I got Bob Marley one use that good singing I think but that's cool I've got a little t1 it's a fire extinguisher this sign is like doesn't really luck so yeah see it still works if you use another water so that sort of works but it's been melted this thing's pretty things there's so much but a lot of cases of what your light isn't it I've also got a Ned Kelly won't fit under her leg Kelly's and you're in share do your research because he's an Aussie a little tell you that since you're gonna cool when it's like from the brain clip up it's really cool I like that it's one of my favorites actually now I had this in my other video it didn't work so I've got it here to show you new and it's

enjoyed if you have lot is putting down the comment though and Canada me you up okay carry me so go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 you know imitation we hearing 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 I got about 30 Laden's if you have more than that or you collect lighters back put them down in the comments and tell me and yeah make sure subscribe my channel and hope you enjoyed this video and thanks for watching have a good day", "HUbwy9eoJWI": "now for this project all you'll need is this specific type of lighter and a small tip screwdriver used for prying stuff open the most important step is to get the right type of lighter and so you need something just like this red one on the left and generally these do not have name brands mine here says Canada light but it could be different for yours and the key is that it has this adjustable knob right here so that's the one that you will need now other lighters do have the adjustable knob like this one here called X light and it does still work pretty good not as good as the other one but if it has the knob it will work this will not work with bic lighter x' as you can see there's no adjustable thing in big liners just suck so don't buy one of these ones so they first up here it is to remove this metal casing at the top and to do that you're going to use your prying utensil I have a small screwdriver here and sticking it in there prying it open you can also stick it in here somewhere and the key is to only remove this metal casing make sure not to remove the wheel as it is almost impossible to put back in so as you can see I've removed the metal casing and this is what it looks like right here that just popped right off and so now to adjust a flame this is the adjuster right here and on the markings underneath sorry there on there on the metal thing you can see positive is by turning this counterclockwise so what we're going to do is turn it as far as you can counterclockwise and then as you can see here it just engages those gears so lift up the block ring to disengage off of the white gears push over to the left so we are not moving the white spindle push it down again to re-engage and open up over down open so I'm going to do that about four times and then we're done the modification and for an additional step you can replace the metal cover for safety err looks so there's the final modification before and after and since it might not look any different now let me take it to a dark room to show you guys the real difference here we are this is the pre modified lighter and this is the one we modified a little bit so let's compare not bad nice and it doesn't go in on its own sometimes so you got to give it a little shake once more comparison hard lay them both at once and there you have it pretty cool modification before and after so I hope you enjoyed the video learn how to do this nice easy modification key is to get the right lighter and follow the steps I showed you and be careful as if you open it too much there is the chance of it going back down the - and exploding in the lighter so be very careful and do it somewhere where if it does explode and won't burn your house down so I'm not responsible but said my part so anyway thanks for watching as always please like comment and subscribe", "0ho8S3MsF7s": "howdy Turtles Creek back with another video today we're going to be checking in on the bic lighter that we've been performing this exposure test about checking in about it once every month and today's conditions are it's pretty dang cold it's about I don't know 15 degrees Fahrenheit there are a couple inches of fresh snow really light powdery fresh snow goes really cold last night when it snowed but this is why I love the wintertime as you can see it's just a beautiful beautiful still day in the forest snow blanketing everything the little bit of snow hanging on the hemlocks it just creates a really beautiful scene and sort of the nice thing about coming out here when it's sunny and the winter and there are or there is you know light snow and that as our branches that when the when the breeze blows you know that light powdery snow comes off the branches and you get this really cool effect and really cool scene basically of the snow sort of glistening in front of the sunbeams and it's really almost you know magical and enchanting and that's why I love the winter there's no bugs you know it's really still it's really quiet in the forest and not a lot of people and it's just you know it really makes her a beautiful day out to enjoy enjoy nature now I want to go find the lighter I need to get a stick and dig it out because it's been under snow for almost the past month and then we'll get a little fire going assuming the lighter works the lighter is somewhere underneath this birch tree oh I want to say it's somewhere down here so it's going to start digging see if we can find it there it is across the leaves on it well that's frozen on their solid snow inside of it someone try to clean this off as best as I can pop it in my pocket and then we're gonna look for some fire materials while this warms up man that's frozen one there if I want to put in my pocket trying to get all this frozen water off of that because I needed to get warm for it to work if it's gonna work all right it's been on the ground for maybe a minute it shouldn't work right away oh look at that probably hold this for the next 10 seconds we'll probably a nice strong flame it's pretty surprising honestly how fast that lit up considering you just saw it was covered basically an ice on one side of it at least look at that that's pretty impressive pretty darn impressive if you ask me all right either way I'm gonna pop in my pocket and go grab some small small wood for the fire this is what I'm going after just a twig bundle gather a little bit more than this but you can see the space behind all this and through this really thin really thin twigs some keep looking maybe get this about twice two or three times the size I have right now it's not like a Bigfoot knock because it is this cold out today I'm not messing around looking for tinder or anything it's got a little bit of fat wood in this pocket I'm going to use the light with the lighter since we're using a layer to get this fire going get the date on that earlier I'm not sure eleven eleven in 2014 not sure the date today all right let's try get a little fire going just getting a little warm in fire today and I don't know like I said I was I'm impressed with that lighter honestly for it being you know we've had arctic air for the past week a couple weeks where you know lows have been in the single digits wind chills have been below that this lighter has been under snow for almost a month steady and you saw when I took it out of the snow it was you know leaves were frozen to it and literally in my hand added you know exposed for 15 20 seconds that first couple clicks a little tiny baby flame that's pretty darn impressive I'm impressed and this fire feels so great right now okay so the last thing I want to do is put the lighter back cover back up with snow until the next time we come out and try it the lighter cool really not too much going all that lighter in terms of where or anything like that that look like it's been out here for almost three months house counting in my head so we know we'll check back in another month or so see how it's doing I hope you liked the video pop one of these up your opposable thumbs that separates us from other

relax on it oh sorry that one says relax on it that this one that was pretty trippy that was actually pretty pretty cool I mean oh yeah forgot I was supposed to show you guys there's that one bunch of

video you know to like subscribe hit the lurks buttons for more weird videos how it going see you on the next one later", "2KI80usm_ig": "well if you're anything like me you like to get as much use out of everything as you can so today I'm going to show you how to take apart a disposable lighter like this BIC I have here and take the Flint out of it and put it into a refillable lighter like this clip or lighter I have here or a Zippo lighter you can use those in in those style lighters as well but the first thing we're going to do is pry off this metal case you can do this by hand but I happen to have a screwdriver handy so that's what I'm going to use to get that metal metal piece off if you've got one with a safety lock you can just bend that back and then we're going to pry back on this plastic piece here that holds the wheel in and make sure that that doesn't go flying is that wouldn't be good we're trying to save the flint and we remove the wheel and there's a spring in here and what's left of a flint now this is he use lighter so they don't they're not super long but they'll give you a little more use out of your refillable writers so this one's a clipper lighter that you can refill and you can also put a new flint in all you got to do is grab onto the striker and just pull it straight out nothing fancy there on the back side you'll see you have like a place you can put a screw or you can put a coin in here our screwdriver or coin or whatever and you just want to unscrew that be able to get your spring off and you take your Flint I'm going to try to get it to back in line there's a little cup on it from where it ran and the other lighter I'm going to try to line it up it may not work but I've got it in there I can go ahead and put the spring back in screw that back together just kind of make sure it's lined up and it spins free and we can go ahead and tighten that back up and put her back in the lighter and she should be good to go there we go that's how I I see the Flint's out of old disposable lighters", "BJIQ82hygac": "there's no way home tonight except on foot mean daughter cruising down through here walking we're ready oh I want to show you something we have to have a fire there's no friction fire tonight it's gonna be slim to none so uh I'm gonna show you something we get up here go there's a couple things I have with me like I said I always carry a knife in no time cuz I have a bit lighter get a fire that's exactly what I need there's a knife and a Bic lighter come up on see the tree here I'll scrape this said bark off of here or the outer bark off of that tree get down to that inner stuff a little bit he's out for a tender bottle scrape it down to you into the dry yeah always always always always go ready or at least no understand your resource and understand where you're at and what you have and your surroundings want a way up here we ran by pine tree I grabbed some SAP off of that makes pitch Wow I'll back in here not that pitch I mean even this bark still moist break it down while that fluff it up just a little if Wendy to beat Wendy happy I'll be hard to get a fire with a lighter let alone anything else going on and with that she still got to heat it up pretty good to get it going without that lighter that wasn't happening not tonight so moral the story understand the surroundings always carry something for combustion and always carry a knife you know there's other things you resource for that right there it's raining it's windy it's nasty there's no it would have been rough to get a friction fire tonight all right thanks for watching just figured I'd share that with you why I pack a Bic lighter y'all have a good night", "seKBPEtGBfQ": "guess whose anniversary it is 25 years 25 years i've been married today to the same beautiful lady that took me 25 years ago by the hand said i do and i obviously did and so we're celebrating 25 years of marriage today it's a big anniversary it's the silver anniversary for for us my parents just celebrated 48 years of their marriage i come from good stock obviously i know that and obviously my wife is partially blind because if you look at her and you look at me you look at her and go you could have done much better all that said thanks so much for joining us on the zeal cigar review today we're going to be talking about if lighting your cigar with a lighter fluid filled lighter versus a butane lighter really changes the taste of the cigar in any way shape and form we'll discover all that so much more next on the zeal cigar review [Applause] [Music] so i have heard from many different people that if you light a cigar with a regular bic lighter like this one right here if i can get it to work yeah i can get it to work a little bit maybe i could turn it up a little bit oh my gosh that's all it goes another reason you shouldn't use a bic lighter a little bit lighter because this thing just doesn't really get look at that i mean there's barely any and i can bare and when there's any kind of wind you can't even get a good burn on there okay look at that there's there's a i have heard that it just keeps blowing out i have heard that if you light your cigar with this kind of lighter that it taints the cigar but i'm gonna so so i'm gonna put that to the test today and i'm actually going to smoke one of these back to back nicaraguas i've actually smoked both these one of these i'm gonna light with a butane lighter and the other i'm gonna light with a bic lighter and tell you honestly if it really changes any kind of flavor okay so i'm gonna light two of the same cigar and we actually have these cigars obviously i'm promoting something in my company uh we have these in a huge mega sale-a-thon i've had these cigars before i've had the back-to-back oh now i've had the back-to-back edition urny and that are you in ry no you are ue i can't remember what it is i've had the elimination torpedo back-to-backs which i really believe are davidoff's repackaged i think they're really good they're beautiful creamy smooth if you like davidoff you got to get this and we have a killer deal on our website with this we have four different sampler packs we have one with just nicaraguas just the connecticuts then we have the connecticuts and nicaraguas together with with the uh a couple torpedoes thrown in there then we have an ultimate sampler and that ultimate sampler actually has a whole tin of the limiteds in there with the cool spray painted tin from the artist in new york um and it comes with 12 of those torpedoes which are just amazing as well as the connecticuts and the nicaraguas which i'm going to smoke today so with all that said today i'm going to get into these i love this cigar i have it all the time i think it's a really good stick this is actually one of the cigars i actually do smoke a lot just by nature the fact that it's more affordable it's like six bucks 609 i think is what it is or 5.99 depending on where you're at in the country i am going to go ahead and light this with a traditional lighter okay so i can get kind of a baseline of how it tastes normally what i'm told any of the residual uh fuel smell is actually burned up because this ends up burning like 1500 degrees technically you could probably weld with this thing but for the sake of argument i'm gonna go ahead and light this cigar with this traditional cigar lighter that is butane then i'm gonna light another cigar okay with the lighter fluid lighter and see if there's any real difference there so i'm punching my cigars and i'm gonna like this one real quick while this isn't like a typical cigar review i'm gonna tell you this cigar is really good it is it's got creamy cocoa notes of cedar in there some nice like uh fruity kind of fig notes on the finish i know a lot of people give me a lot of uh comments about me burning the tip of my cigar well i purge my cigar before i finally light it so i broke through then i really like my cigar so when i'm charring my cigar the end of my cigar while a lot of people don't like that i will say it actually works pretty well particularly when you purge before you relight so i don't really care about charring the end of the cigar and a lot of guys do i don't i've never tasted a big difference from that great cigar if you don't know these back to backs then you need to get it you really need to get these they're incredible it's a good it's a it's a meteor cigar obviously in the connecticut a little bit of pepper slight pepper on there um coco and like fig fig newtons cocoa and fig newtons i got on this one that's just me now i can tell you how it tastes just in the first first third right here now i'm gonna light one with a lighter fluid lighter and see if it changes the taste at all okay so here we go so you can see right now i'm having a problem just with the air okay just with the air but i'm lighting it like this well the first thing i got to tell you is this the tip of this is extremely hot right now just from keeping the flame on there and i really don't have a good i really can't get a good like even burn as i'm trying to light it but on the smoke there i didn't taste a ton of difference i think i know what they're talking about now it's a little different it definitely is a little different different taste so i'm gonna have the left one and my the one in my left hand is with the bic lighter the one in my right hand is the traditional cigar lighter and let me see how that smokes oh that's beautiful it really is okay okay now i got the i got the i got the flavor profile on that now with the bic lighter and see if it's changed any i want to say it has um but not super significantly i could taste a little bit of like what they would call that lighter fluid taste or like a not a gasoline taste it's almost like it almost reminds me in the retro hail of a little bit of diesel fuel um but it's not diesel fuel obviously it's just lighter fluid i can see what they're talking about and you can actually see it on the flame the flame the yellow part of the flame that's not nearly as hot as this blue part of the flame right here so this is burning off any kind of taste that would translate into the cigar when you light it versus this one that's really not burning it off it's really kind of just kind of putting it in there um so but i'm telling you it's not tremendously bad yeah especially on the retro heel at the very end of the like on the finish you could taste a little i could taste a little bit of that um lighter fluid taste not a ton but a little bit just i mean it's not gonna here's the thing to be brutally honest i don't know that it matters a ton if if taste matters to you and smoky cigars i don't know that you're going to taste it a ton unless you have a really well developed palette that does taste way different i'm just going to say this right now i mean maybe i just i really will say this does taste different the cigar that i that i lit with the the traditional butane cigar lighter uh the three torch uh or you can do it with a match it takes a lot longer with a match swipe before butane torches um it does taste better hands down it does taste better a lot more distinct chocolate on there some sweet cedar on there a little bit of that figginess on the retro hail and none of that like uh fuelly taste if you if you would none of that fuel and back to the lighter fluid one the more i smoke it the more i can actually taste it to be honest with you um so if you want to white your cigar with a bic lighter or one of these lighters if you would um i'm not gonna fault you for it i'm just gonna tell you it really will detract or you really can taste a little bit of that fuel in there um i wouldn't recommend it uh in fact i've been telling people never do this i don't know that i ever did a video where i've compared and contrast like bic lighters to like butane lighters uh or traditional lighter fluid lighters or even zippos around the same risk i imagine a zippo lighter uh so much more gets transferred because you're you're just dousing the cotton in the zippos with with lighter fluid you know so um i imagine but i'm telling you i get the lighter fluid in this one i really do the more i smoke it the more you can see that i'm smoking both the left hand is the lighter fluid and this one is the right hand so you can see i'm smoking them both about the same about the same same distance if you would left hand is lighter fluid right hand is the original so i'm going to kind of cleanse my pal a little bit with water probably do better with coffee but i've had enough coffee this morning already that's a good cigar i'll tell you what the tobacco is on display in this cigar i got none of that lighter fluid even not even a little bit of hint on that one um this is just pure good tobacco tobacco untainted by any of that fluid smell or maybe just a little bit slight aftertaste now i will say light chocolate some some some figginess some great cedar notes on this maybe a little bit of slight leather as well dang fine cigar it's a very good cigar it really is yeah and no like aftertaste whatsoever when lighting it with just the butane lighter okay the butane lighter so just so you know there are soft flame butane lighters as well we have some of those and you can and you can use the butane lighter as well with that but butane and lighter fluid are very different and from what i understand um the lighter fluid has more of an aftertaste so you can refill the soft flame butane but it is highly recommended by many people in the industry and now i would say including myself to not use a traditional lighter fluid lighter when lighting your premium cigars now if you have to and you're in a pickle and that's the only thing you have of course use a bic if you have to but i will tell you there is a difference there is a difference i taste just a slight fuel-esque difference on this now here's the question you have to ask yourself is this just mental for me is it mental because i know this and if i did it blind could i tell the difference i don't know because i didn't do it blind i'm just trying to be honest with you when i taste um but in a pickle i don't know if there's that much of an aftertaste to deter me from never using a big if i needed it in a pickle i am telling you that if you're gonna light your premium cigars you will want to use this premium okay jetline awesome lighter okay versus just your traditional bic lighter you absolutely will in fact this thing is still hot for me just using it so all that said guys i'm definitely i'm definitely recommending these cigars any premium cigar that you have to be lit with a butane fueled lighter not no not a lighter fluid lighter so but in a pinch could you use the bic lighter absolutely you could can i can i tell an overwhelming difference it just changes the flavor profile completely not on this cigar now i can imagine on lighter cigars it might change the flavor profile a little bit but on this cigar it really didn't it just didn't so and if you guys are looking for a really good deal on some premium cigars we have these in a sampler for you and the sampler i'll leave it in the description along with a social media link so you connect with us there i hope you learned something today on the video i know that i did and i can highly recommend lighting your cigar with a butane filled lighter versus a lighter field lighter but yet i will say this if you need to use the lighter fluid lighter it's not going to completely ruin at least i know this cigar i know it could probably ruin maybe a connecticut or a lighter cigar that doesn't have as much dark tobacco in there that's a stronger cigar so with a stronger cigar maybe it won't affect it as much but with lighter cigars i can absolutely imagine it affecting it more so that's all i have time for today thank you guys so very much for watching and again do me a favor and click on the social media links and follow us because we want to follow you and chat with you back and forth on facebook instagram snapchat all that kind of stuff so with that said guys i'm out of here and i gotta go [Music] you", "KVrLEInohvA": "guess who's back JD's man or clipper I have both she got a bit in that size tactical Owens some of our lives I don't a bonus that's that's that size and then you've got the we sighs all right I've got so many life so ever play with tile granite shop with gouge I'm always buying other these or Clippers but you know you don't see these much and the shops the old bits but top of the Bix I mean they've seen all different tests on them and everything Charles are bits not refillable it's just once it's used I say it's job done big coming loaded for colors and then you've got your clipper that's my pink no can't something like that and also clipper do we know I've got other colors said I must have a  box with eyes but the beauty of these lighters you can refill them alright and I bought that clipping company I have a light I'm a lighter perv and that comes in a like a weak case the clip was doing different colors and different it make you every time a guy had a gouge always always get me shove another clipper so what knows what means good because they're refillable but what a company done I've got my moves company name our X or tak of your XO tech tired to be pants and soy trousers not American now look amongst yourselves back up on that okay I'll never use this one but X attack they do who sleep you're lighter so I'm just an interval tape man that really got no nails oh I'll put up another week video in a bit and just some more life at sea when I was out if you're interested so yeah sorry big lights it's in there hang on do nice job oh no but ex attack I mean this weren't cheap I think you like knocking I mean for what it is I mean it wasn't cheap with the honesty of yeah I bought there that is good like we kit well be nice you vex our tech done them for clippers I don't have to do one for clippers but X attack if you're watching a of every doubt about it can you make one for the Clipper cause bricks we like our Clippers that for that other critical exists this floats as well so so and why why tactical because if you drop it in the grass you could drop it in the glass because so I tell you what  and how do these little about yeah tell me what you think I'm gone more cheaper than BIC", "RcHkBZUEyGQ": "hey what's going on guys well this video is going to be for my friend Tex if you guys saw the unboxing video he threw in a lighter which he got at a gas station and it said it was working great and all of a sudden started crap out on wasn't working at all so he sent it to me knowing that I'm into all kinds of lighters as well to see if I could fix it he said I can go ahead and keep it but I'll probably send it back since it is his lighter and now that I fixed it I just want to make a little video talking a little bit about it first thing I did was remove it from its case there's basically a little screw here and I remove the screw but basically that right there is an adjustment knob which texts obviously scratch the case they are trying to adjust it but anyway the little hole to the right there that's where the screw was that's all it's holding in the body so now we can open it up looks like a little bomb or something but uh even though it looks a little complicated it's actually pretty straight forward so we have here here's a screwdriver the pointer we have the full fuel tank which you can see I filled back up it's not completely filled but because I was doing a lot of testing with it we also have the this is what creates a spark when you push this down and that this little black thing here there's actually a wire in there and the spark travels up here and into the top okay and it'll actually spark in here which catches when the fuel is released as well the other little tube here this clear tube right here is a direct fuel line into the the back here I actually have to get in real close to show you this but if you get to see that clear tube connects directly with the the fuel tank here okay so basically what I realized that they're looking at this closely is when you first open the top it actually lifts this up which let me see if I can do this slowly to show you as you the top look right here at this bar which is connected to the hinge so as you open this up see how that lifts and by lifting up it's actually releasing fuel through this tiny little clear hose and that in turn slowly leaks out of that hole to the left okay it's right well let's let this focus come on come on focus anyway it's right here not the main area it's a little hole right there to left alright so look at that right now with the lid open it's leaking fuel now the problem is that this will not light that by itself now you can see I fixed the main main lighter so that we have a flame there might be hard to see but perfectly fine wind proof flame you can see it and you can hear it it's working fine now and I'll explain how I fix it but when you let go of this that flame is actually supposed to like that and I'm use a different lighter here this is a bow MPL with the flexible neck you'll see what there we go you'll see that there's supposed to be a regular flame alright so when you're not when the thing is open after you light it it goes to a regular flame here's your jet flame and when you let go it's supposed to go back to a regular flame until you close the lid but it doesn't I'm not exactly sure why I mean where it's initially placed in here it should work fine the jet flame will always work but in order to get that other flame to work you have to actually hold it upside down so when you let go it will engage and light the fluid that is slowly leaking at a little hole so even though I fixed it to where it's going to work to light his cigarettes it's not working 100% and it really is supposed to light that up as well okay see when that lids open you'll constantly a little fuel there so that's pretty much it the problem here is the first thing I look for when these lighters don't work is a is their fuel in there obviously you can visually see yes there's there's fuel and these take butane butane lighter fluid not the the regular lighter fluid so yes it had had fluid next thing you wanna ask yourself is it sparking okay and obviously if it's not lighting right away you can look in the top there and see if when you push the button this is an electric lighter you'll see if it's actually sparking in this case it's sparking and engaging every time so that wasn't the issue then you want to make sure that there's actually fluid coming out of it now when I held this up close to my ear with it open you can hear it it's long enough to view bill to hear it on camera but I was able to hear the fluid come out that's because it was leaking out of this hole right here that had nothing to do with the main part of the lighter so looking further into it I couldn't really figure out what it is so what I usually do in this case is I'll unscrew the bottom of the valve here for the main fuel area and I completely drained all the fuel out of it and then put it back together and refueled it and sometimes when you use cheap butane fluid there's a lot of you know other crap that's in it and you'll find that sometimes they'll actually clog somewhere along the way it actually clogs up okay it might sound like this fuel there's fuel coming out but it never actually comes out therefore you'll get the just a sparking and nothing ever happens but now everything's fixed lighter works fine except for that secondary stage which of course should be lit like that so anyway interesting little lighter I guess that II I picked this up at a gas station somewhere along the lines and you can see just from this demo how much fuel I used maybe a little but anyway I used about half what's in there so I'll fill this back up and I'll give text the option of letting me keep it or send it back home so I like little projects like this just to you know things have kind of look at things take them apart see how they work if they are broken try to fix them you know basically the mechanics here like I said it might be a little intimidating when you open this up it looks like I said like a little bomb or something but if you really just look at it and breakdown it's a pretty simple design you have fuel in here by opening the lid and pushing the button down or by opening lid first you're actually letting open the valve to let fuel get through and of course and you push the button down it will spark that the fuel vapors and light so pretty simple concept there but anyway I want to make a video showing text that I did fix it for him and I will put this back together and I'll refill it and like I said he'll have the option to to get it back if he if he wishes to so anyway that's all just want to make a little video there and explain it if you guys have these butane lighters they all pretty much work the same way fuel tank some kind of a valve here which opens up obviously when you need to use a lighter and a lot of these are electric and this little piece here if you've gotten little electric throwaway lighters before when the lighters old done you said when I was a kid I used to take these out and actually used to spark my friends arms and stuff in the middle a middle like math class which was totally the wrong thing to do I should have been doing my work instead but I was very amused by that when you take these adda lighters even if the lighters dead I'm not talking about this because this is refillable okay but if you have like a Bick even makes a on electric lighter where instead of actually using a wheel and sparking it's just a button it just clicks that's an electric lighter and it works the same way as this piece in here which when you when compressed together it makes a little spark and basically a little black water here you have exposed metal at the end and then you just kind of click it together and I'll make a little spark it's kind of like the same power as static electricity all right if you ever get a shock from walking across carpet and then touching a doorknob or something it's like that it's not going to hurt or anything but it's a little shock and it's kind of fun to play around to friends but I don't suggest to do that in school I suggest you actually do your work so you can learn a lot and get a good job and have a good life but uh anyway that's what I did with my time unfortunately I wish I can go back and do the right thing but anyway just a little tidbit there maybe after after school when you get out of school you can screw around your friends and shock them but that's pretty much it just want to make a video and show text is lighter and I did actually clean up a little bit it was dirty that's slob supposedly his car likes to eat lighters whenever he gets a new lighter the seat just gobbles it up and he loses it forever I told him before he sells as a his car you better rip that seat down get all those lighters back but anyway that's it that's my video hope you guys enjoyed it maybe you learned something maybe you didn't either way thanks for watching take care guys", "m3q2CPs8M4s": "I drop this big glider in a can of paint this morning now it's working fine Oscar's always had the problem of keeping his grant money quick since it liking your BIC has become America's favorite pastime so we hear lots of stories about people who expect through thin and thick last year and lost this planting potatoes now I just found it can you imagine what it's like not to with your bit for a whole year", "9vRf0CKQDy4": "hello everyone welcome back so today we have another lighter this is made by i guess it says honest on it um i love the box check out that box hey that is so cool slide this open and we have a nice canvas bag and i'll tell you what this bag is pretty sturdy in the bottom we have a little brush we have a couple extra flints no extra wick me pull this out of the bag is there anything else in there nope now check that out look at that what does that remind you of well if you saw my video on the world war two trench lighter that my friend mitchell over from guns knives and beer so graciously gifted me look at this it's definitely a knock off of that a little different but definitely a knockoff on it so this inspired um this as a gift for me and i received this for my birthday now one thing that's different on this lighter is the windshield actually slides up and down now i'm going to guess that that would be for a pipe smoker so that you can hold it this way and you can have the flame come down into the pipe um i'm not 100 sure i don't smoke a pipe but urban maybe you uh might be able to tell me but uh then if you want the windshield on you you slip it up it works great i dig it so there you go we have our uh honest lighter to add to the collection so thanks everyone i appreciate your views i appreciate your comments as always i really really do i hope you're having a great day and we'll see you in the next one", "1erl_piODr8": "I guess what's going on so welcome back hash tag I'm your host Ethan and today we are doing more mods but it's not our typical car mods we are going to be working on a big lighter interesting right alright okay started give me just a second set up my camera and we'll get to it ah that's where that was just working all right I assume you can see me right here so here's what we got look at a typical big lighter and the only month I know might help up ahead it's good average start with huh nope no screwdriver pliers okay now you want to take a small screwdriver handle pliers pry your windshield out just a little bit now this is really simple to put back on you'll just push it back together and let's get enough man we'll just push down on the top I'll show you that later now we're taking the safety mechanism off today it's a lot easier to start without it that's what's going to look like there's two little metal prongs here that hold it in if you use pull straight up pops right off now with that removed it's gonna we should go right on there okay right okay now why do I have one off over here because I was playing with this earlier now I was reading something online probably should I'm going to ask you is one of these taller than the other maybe a little bit I will give that some okay so here's what is that if you take a pair of pliers on this and turn it counterclockwise like you're unscrewing on well that it will increase the flame rate however they suggested like a hundred two hundred fifty turns and that's totally bizarre compared to the old style well the cheaper lighters with a lever on them where it's really easy to run them up I've never seen this before and that was pretty interesting so first time trying it and I had already turned it 25 maybe 15 times and there is a little bit of a lighter of a flame increase put our heat shield or windshield back on and I don't know it might be a little taller so whether or not it's true I will let you let your opinions I think there's a little bit of difference there now here's the next thing I saw online and I do not agree with this but it's worth mentioning just because when I read was if you take a dump in micro pegboard for a cork board message board whatever poke a little hole right there on empty lighter note I must you should really be empty Co a hole in there then you take a butane refillable cannister and you press against it and they filled it and then you hold your finger over it and take the thumb pin and stick back into it and it's refillable lighter I would not ever do that that sounds totally awful I've been wondering if there was way to refill a Bic lighter however I don't think that seems safe so the best I can do is remove the safety lock and what's funny is I actually have a friends that was part of the movement for the they changed here's part of the lawsuit that changed it from child proof to child resistant because I was a child he burnt the house down well I probably shouldn't say that anyways so it's a lot easier light and flick flick your bit right this goes with it like your brick techcom anyway letting is your flight without the child safety on there especially when it's cold hands etc so that's my mod and I don't know I think I actually trying to light her up I will try it more later see if we can't get some excessive line but that's my lighter mod thanks for watching don't forget to follow me on instagram at trash tag and don't forget subscribe thanks for watching", "QnKg9JC1Klc": "hey kids do you know what time it is it's lighter review time yep this year is a capsule or as they're more commonly known peanut lighter it's a small metal capsule screws together it has an o-ring seal so it's waterproof and inside is a small lighter these lighters are very very similar to a Zippo in construction and the way they're mechanism works except obviously for the size and shape now what are these good for well one of the problems with a Zippo is after a week or two the fuel tends to evaporate even if you don't use it that's because the petroleum distillate fuel they use is very very volatile it evaporates extremely easily if it isn't in a sealed container and these provide a sealed container this one I made into a necklace and it's been sitting around haven't filled it in months and there we go just beautiful and one of the problems with butane lighters is they have problems the cold they do not work well close to or below freezing that's because basically butane to be a gas has to be a certain temperature which is above freezing if if you completely freeze a butane lighter it just won't work because the gas will be a liquid it'll just basically stay there and not burn now these are well I guess you could call them knockoff peanut lighters to the best of my knowledge the originals are from County calm and those ones and I have one this one has been sitting in my personal survival kit for months and months the county calm ones are made out of stainless steel or you can also get them in titanium and they have a flat bottom self will stand up very high quality threads on the screw together construction there we go yay flame yep I don't know where the County common ones are made these ones are made in China this is an older one that's on the necklace the newer ones I've been getting have this high polished finish as you see the end is rounded so they can't stand up on their own which is a bit of a bummer but I'm not really a huge deal honestly these aren't really practical that uses a candle their fuel capacity is just too low they they they'll burn through their fuel in I think under five minutes so being able to stand free on their own just really doesn't seem important to me now on these ones the cases are made out of aluminum or at least an aluminum alloy of some kind so they are a little softer than the stainless steel there are a little more prone to scratching but on the plus side the County common ones go for I think it's $12 plus shipping and County com chipping starts at like 9 nothing against that they are they're an awesome product they really are worth the money but you can get ones like this quite a bit cheaper a lot cheaper like a few dollars each yeah you could probably get two or three of these for the price of one from county come and they work just fine in fact I mean take a look here you know these inserts look darn near identical it would not really surprise me if the inserts are made in the same Factory I mean I'm chill remembering which ones which I think this is the one that came with the county come excuse of you inside the capsules I guess if you wanted to you could just use the capsule for storing some very small items take the lighter out but overall these are really cool little lighters I like them a lot I use them very frequently myself I put them in little survival kits just because they hold their fuel for so long they're so simple and reliable they use readily available fuel in Flint's because they be they're basically the operating mechanism is identical to a Zippo so they you know zip hopefully it'll work in these zipper wicks should work in these there's really nothing bad to say about them except like if you're a smoker maybe and um or for some other reason are using a light or lots and lots of times a day you know maybe this isn't the lighter for you these are letters for people who use a lighter occasionally and want to have something tucked away in a pocket or in a pack or something that they're sure is going to work when they need it but they're not using it every day why do I say that well because compared to pulling a bit out of your pocket and flicking it and getting an instant flame you know you fish this out you unscrew it it's very small it comes apart into two pieces you have to make sure not to get them separated when you're done with it screw it back together again so it's just it's not like it's hard work but if you want to flick a light on to light up a cigarette or something or you know you're doing paracord project or something and are melting the ends of dozens of pieces of card this probably isn't a lighter for you it this is this is something you might want to have in your pocket in your glove box in your backpack just in case you ever do need a really reliable source of flame next to a fire steel I would say these are one of the top most reliable ways of getting a fire yeah I mean they're really really good they have just hold their fuel indefinitely they're durable they have very few moving parts compared to most lighters so there you guys go one of my favorite little lighters the peanut lighter both the cheapo version and the very nice stainless steel County common version which has lived in my personal survival kit for probably like a year or two very pleased with them both in their own way hope you guys enjoyed the video and have a nice day now", "67oGiGerQK4": "hello everyone welcome back to howling hoosier outdoors so today we're going to be talking about three survival hacks that i've learned about big lighters over the years so the first thing that we're going to talk about is the bic lighter itself a lot of these big lighters come with decorative plastic coatings and sheets and stuff that come over and i've found that they really don't serve a purpose and then they wear and tear and end up peeling off anyway in my pocket but also if you peel those off you can then see how much fluid is left in your lighter if you see that shaking down you can see that this lighter is actually a little less than halfway full and that's just a quick way of seeing how much is left especially if you tilt it sideways next hack that we can talk about is just duct tape duct tape as i've shown in a previous video is a phenomenal emergency fire starter so i'll keep really i'll typically keep a stash of it wrapped around the duct tape and this is just half of a standard roll of duct tape the next hack what we're going to do is we're going to pop this little device thing off i believe that this is a child safety um child safety device in order to make it more difficult in order to strike the lighter and we're just going to pop that off what this does using my swiss army knife insert that straight underneath and then just pull straight up and that's going to send it flying and that's just going to go and there you go that makes it incredibly easy to light which is not a bad thing when you're dealing with cold weather out on the trail or if you're even trying to dry this out so if this bic lighter gets wet you can then blow on this and that's going to dry out the striking surfaces that ignite the butane coming out a lot easier than if that guard was in place last but not least we're going to wrap this in paracord so my personal preference and how to wrap these is yeah i create a bite at the end of a hank of paracord start this at the bottom placing the bite down then the extra and then we're just going to wrap this i've seen people wrap their walking sticks like this i've seen people wrap their knife handles like this i understand that i'm watching this wrap through the camera so this is a little bit trickier than i thought it's not gonna be as tight as i'd like but y'all will at least get the gist of this so once we get about right here feed this working end through your first bite pull that all the way through and then up here when you pull this one it's going to tighten this entire thing down now you have an extra hank of paracord along with your emergency duct tape now i've also seen people tape sail needles or keep those strass strapped along the inside here i've also seen people modify their lanyards in a way or this wrap in a way that it fits underneath here so that way you don't have to worry about depressing this and then fuel leaking out but what is also really cool is that with this extra amount at the end of this you can then tie a knot not just a simple overhand knot or in this case we're going to do a bowline but this will create a loop that you can then secure this lighter to your person either through a belt loop that's a really small bow one we're gonna redo that so this will either be able to secure to a belt loop order a pocket so that way you can quickly access it if you need to there you go so we're going to pretend that this is a belt loop feel that feed that lighter back through and then that'll just sit nicely on your belt belt loop so anytime that you need to pull it out quickly you can just yank on this paracord alrighty folks those are just three bic i guess that'd be technically four bick uh survival hacks uh big lighter hacks hope you all enjoyed the video stay awesome folks", "zrijCiWjUXM": "Oh for refill and lighter you will need of course a debt lighter one pushpin and Boonton gas first step is to open the valve at bottom of the lighter and you can do this by pushing the tiny BB inside the cartridge with push pin after doing this take your boot and gas and put it over the coal and hold it about five seconds then quickly place your thumb over the hole and with push pin close the hole and that's it how to refill an empty lighter you can check my video how to make custom USB Drive thanks for watching subscribe and visit my channel page", "IYHeqh4opD8": "okay this review is on bic lighters specifically this one today I've been trying out the classic and the electronic ignite one I bought a five pack of the classic and immediately took off the safety clip that goes around the flint wheel so I I didn't even try them I just took them off right away I'm I'm a little you know I'm I'm an older guy and I was brought up on lighters not having this on there so I just took it off before I even tried to use the lighter they there is a little bit of a technique to get them off but they're not that difficult to remove and I can't really show you in the video how to do it because it is a safety device and I don't want to show how it's dumb but there are some videos online that do show how it's done but it does make the lighter a lot easier to use at least that's what I think because I didn't even try it with the safety on so this is the one that I want to test put this off to the side I'm basically I'm just going to take it and dunk it in the water and then try to light it again so I mean I've been playing with this for about 24 hours and it it almost ignites every single time I think I've only had it a couple times where it didn't ignite on the first the first time and I noticed you can kind of relieve the pressure and go almost all the way to the top before the flame goes out so it's a little a little easier to hold it if you you if you let the pressure off I'll probably do a couple reviews on this one later on but this is just the water test now we all know that this one here if I dumped it in the water it would stop working there's lots of videos on that so I'm not going to even try with the BIC classic okay so it lights throw it in the water it looks like it actually floats a little bit haha so I don't know 15 20 seconds in there huh that's cool that it floats I thought if you're sure you go right to the bottom let me get a towel I think that's long enough of course kind of pound some of the water out to the side that's the first time I've done this I have not tried this yet so I'm not even a smoker so until I've been designing my bug-out bag I've had no reason to buy lighters so I'm kind of learning as I go Wow there's no edits in this video you guys this is straight okay I do have some issues with the electronic ignition lighter the bit this one but I'm not going to discuss it now because I'm I'm trying to get another version of this but well Wow okay it was delayed a little bit so let's let it sit for just a few more that's pretty good guys you can't complain so I'm just gonna let it sit because there was a little bit of a it didn't ignite on the first the first try okay so you saw it it went in the water just dried it off a little bit and went like this wow that's surprising I didn't think it would do that so anyway look for the other review later on on on these bic lighters and and then I'll do a review on this one as well because this is a good lighter too I mean I mean these are there's a reason why they call them classic because they are good lighters okay thanks for watching", "FLo500J6NxU": "hey what's going on guys so today I'm going to talk about the lighter that I just bought I've been using it for a couple days and I'm very very happy with it so it's time to talk about it this was recommended by someone on Instagram they know who they are I greatly appreciate a big thumbs up when I was talking about lighters and I want to get something for the pouch because I had the little cheapo one in there which happened to fit fine I just wanted a slender lighter that I would be able to use for many years so I wanted decent quality lighter this one was recommended when I first saw it I'm like that's it I have to get that one and I weighed a little bit I hesitated because I don't really want to spend 30 bucks on the new lighter I was gonna trade for something but I thought you know what forget it so I did I bit the bullet pay 30 bucks and I could not be happier with it it is a vector summit I think yes the summit is the case that came in it's a little sleeve and a little textured box foam piece and here it is you can see the paid full price 29.95 got this one through ebay for the same price on Amazon there's a little advertisement for some other vegetable Enders yeah my criteria was slim so there's obviously a lot of slim lighters on the market while you guys did suggest some cool ones which I greatly appreciate but ultimately I ended up with the summit so let's talk about it so here it is in the case it literally like just fits in the case alright it's snug it's not gonna fall out but I can't get it in now here's the widest point with this little selector switch here so um yeah here's the lighter it's a very simple concept you see on a standard lighter we have a wheel which rubs on a flint there's a spring that pushes a flint up there so it rubs on the fly it makes a spark and as we're sparking the same time we're hitting this little button here which releases the guess this is like forked in there if you've never taken a later part and when you push the button down at pivots and lifts up a little collar which let's let's gas come through so in one sweeping motion we're sparking you're letting gas out and obviously when we're doing this we're holding the button down so gas is coming out till we let go and we let go the flame goes out right simple concept great designs in a million layers this one is different there is no button there instead the buttons down here so we have an on and off switch essentially the little dot is off and the fire is on so what you can do with this and the concept behind it is you can use the lighter to spark tinder or kindling or whatever and you know start a fire without the gas so if you run out of fuel you can still light a fire but you can still spark your lighter without wasting gas on this lighter if I want to spark it you know and there's gas in there I'm gonna be hitting that button every time you know I'm saying so it's hard to spark this without hitting the button so again I can spark this as much as I want without wasting any of the gas all you have to do is rotate this and turn the gas on the second I rotate you're gonna hear it that's the on position any off position so that's essentially replacing our button alright so you turn it on spark it and then there's our flame now I have a set kind of high you can adjust this higher or even lower so we have a strong butane plane all right you guys can see that right and when I watch this later off simply rotate that well it's nice about this though as well is that it makes it hands-free because I'm gonna have to hold on to this button it becomes a hand free later as well so turn on spark that left it on table if I want it sits upright I can do projects here if I want to I don't know Heat color something anodized something like that you know or if I want to you know shove it deep into you know my fire then I'm trying to get started whatever the case may be it can use it hands-free so I have those two benefits of leaving the gas off just sparking it or using a lighter in a hands-free fashion which is really really cool now of course you're thinking alright well you keep sparking the thing what happens when the Flint runs out you know this whole piece it make sure it's not super hot which it's not this whole piece just pulls out there's a little screw in the bottom and you unscrew that you have a little spring and your Flint so you can easily replace the Flint so I I love the lighter it's super cool it's worth every bit of the 30 bucks they have a couple different colors I was very tempted to get they like a sapphire blue really vibrant really cool they also like a you know spectrum rainbow color one and I think there's a there's a fourth color but anyway I end up going with the gunmetal gray just to kind of continue with this theme didn't have like a bare stainless one but I love it put it in this way like I said the widest part is this little switch but when I put it in I was worried about the switch actually rotating but it doesn't just fits right in and it's nice and snug it's not gonna fall out but I can't retrieve it what I need to so yeah the vector summit super happy with it absolutely love it can't say enough about it it's really cool down the road if something happens it breaks doesn't work anymore for some reason of course I'll let you know about it but for now I'm very happy with it and it's replacing the cheapo layer thanks just gonna do the job even better and it's kind of classy and different so that's my you know pocket EDC option for a long time like I said I might change oh they also make a black one that's what it was there's a black version so this is a closest to like a stainless that's why I picked the gun mill but who knows maybe I'll get the black born in the future replace it with a black light and get the black Fisher Space Pen alright gonna be kind of cool to a little black set up there I just like having a consistent theme I guess but anyway there you go if you guys have that later let me know what you think of it long-term if you have all the lighters they like you know write those as well people love lighters I love using lighters for all kinds of stuff so thanks for watching guys hope you have an awesome day and I'll see you tomorrow with another video take care", "N8axY8kGMg4": "what up you too this your boy Big Mike fro 20 lifestyle and today we're gonna do just a quick short video of how to refill a clipper lighter this is one a little short instructional videos where you get them and we've got to be running those short quick videos like this during the week so anybody who's been around you get one of these lighters called Clippers most sliders are disposable that you get like this and you call them away once they're done into a landfill so what Clippers are different you can actually refill these from changing the Flint to actually refill in the later so today's video we just want to refill it barely lighten so what's your need basically all you need is a can of butane these cans be chased a moment come with additional tips on the top this one is just like more of a universal and you take the lip the tip and start it in a lighter so you got a red tap couple of pumps Oh and boom you got a lighter refill ready to go now works with all Clippers and some of the other refillable lighters let's check out the bottom so boom you liked this video one of my little short videos check out another video you looking for a little bit more Big Mike check out my playlist you really like Big Mike you want to see me all Azhar look down some button si subscribe you hit that button you hit that Bell you know any time I pass so this your boy Big Mike have a great great evening good luck", "aAna86qNtuA": "hey there so I a little video about a lighter comparison here the mini bic till we all use backpacking because it is pretty much the most ultralight and widely available lighter and it's great it fits snugly inside your cook kit and I just stumbled on a different lighter that I didn't even know existed it's the the clipper and this is actually the mini clipper and there's a bigger version of it this is the bigger version she could see next to it it's a little bit bigger and I actually found this one in the bathroom in Capote late when I was eating in there and it was on the floor in the bathroom and I saw and I just thought huh kind of an interesting the collider so on I decided to look into it more and I'm glad I did there's a few things to compare it between these lighters and some differences and some extra features that this has compared to the BIC so let's take a look at those so let's look at the difference in weight both of these are brand new lighters the only thing I have done is taken off the labels so they are both Factory full brand new so let's check let's check the mini bic in grams it is eleven point four six grams point four ounces the clipper thirteen point nine four nine five grams and 0.49 two ounces now let's look at a how tall it is how tall they are from the bottom to the tallest point on the mini bic it is 2 and 7/16 excuse me with the mini clipper and I'm going to turn this around the flattest spot two and a half so we're talking about a sixteenth inch difference in height and it almost looks like the mini Clippers a lot taller you know not by a lot but it kind of seems like it'd be more than that but from the tallest points being it's only a 16th inch difference and widthwise when you put them together I was looking at it earlier and I'll try to show it to you now but width wise they're pretty much identical this clipper has this flange sticking out of it here and so this is the widest part on the lighter but when you put them two together they are pretty much identical I was really looking at the heart of my eye earlier in that's what I noticed they are identical with why so the BIC is slimmer in a sense this one is round but yeah there's that now with the with the regular size picked the full size Bix you can either get the white one or you can buy one with the vinyl wrap on it and tear the vinyl wrap off and it's it's able to be translucent somewhat or you can see through it to know how much fluid you have left what these mini Bix though they don't have any white ones and it's it's really tough to see how much fluid is actually in there sorry I was going off camera but um you know it's really hard you got to kind of look up at it look up at the light you know or something like that but these Clippers besides this one where they have all kind of designs they also sell a translucent version and they I bought these on Amazon in the four pack did you see here and as you can see you can see the fluid inside them and that's the yellow one this is the green one the blue one and even the red one you can see it now the main difference is these are disposable and that's what I have trouble with a lot you know every time I get ready to go on the backpacking ship I go and buy a new one because it's like well I only use it a few times but how much is really in there I don't know you shake it and try to gauge but do you really know you know so I've just got you know a drawer full of these things that are just you know partially filled but these Clippers are refillable so you can buy fluid and you don't have to throw it out you know you don't have to keep replacing it you can just go buy some fluid in and refill it and also there's some other little new features to it so let's talk about those besides being refillable you can also replace the Flint and you do that by way of this out you can actually pull the Flint and the igniter out and sorry about that see if you can see that there's kind of a screw notch there if I can get it on cam there's sort of a screw notch for a flat tip screwdriver hmm I haven't taken one out yet so uh hold on let's do it real quick or what if you just wanted to use this you could leave this at home if you wanted to and you just bring this start your stove with that I like this that way by itself hmm why don't why don't we find out spring into the micro scale and that um it's on ounces right now which is 0.9 1 now so it's not even an ounce for if you just want to bring this by itself just to use the starter stove with so there's that well let's take a look at um taking this Flint out so she's supposed to be able to unscrew it which it's kind of tough to do but it can be done if not you can always use a screwdriver and there it is and I'm just realizing that unless I have it out there it's not really focusing so my apologies you get it hopefully so let's put it back in twisted back all right and then this slides back in here there it is also with this mini clipper supposedly I don't know if you can be able to tell on a video or not but if you light it and tilt it to the side it expels more fluid and and the lighter gets bigger or the flame gets bigger I should say and then it goes back down if you tilt it this way kinda hard to tell kind of hard to tell on video I know sorry about that there meanie big kind of does it a little bit to kind of does it a little bit to but like I said it's very hard to tell on video at least with this cheap or this iPhone that I'm using to make this video with but it does expel more fluid so there's that point also so just something interesting I purchased these on Amazon they were a pack of four for eight dollars and they also came with a pack of Flint's so that's pretty good deal I mean it's two dollars each or so with the pack of flint so um there's that so when you go to Amazon look up Amazon translucent mini clipper and that's what you'll get all in all I'm pretty jazzed about them I haven't actually used them in the field yet so I don't know if there's gonna be any big differences but I doubt it they are built pretty nicely they use the same nylon that the Bicks used as far as the housing construction so they're definitely not like the cheap 50 cent lighters that I would never trust out in the field oh yeah what about waterproofness or drying out hmm I haven't checked that why don't we check that hold on a second how about when they get wet what happens if you dunk them in a glass of water and let them sit for about 10 minutes and do they restart let's see we know the Bix work to try it and trust you choo Bix they always work and how about the Clipper so um they they are both fully dunked so why don't we give it about ten minutes and then I'll come back and check them how about that so while we're waiting for the lighters to get a fully absorbed with water I figured for kicks and giggles I just try to start the stove with what the flint by itself so uh let's see what happens Oh supposed to be going that way supposed to be going this way so let's see what happens and there it is I guess you could I guess you could say it's a bit close for comfort but how much difference is the lighter really I mean there it is let's try it one more time let's try it one more time so it's not bad you know you could totally use this separate by itself just start your stove and um might be a little hard on cold nights it is kind of small but it can be done so there is that well look the Clipper um the BIC is still drying but the Clipper the Clippers sparking up and the big hmm I don't know how long the pickle take it probably have to let us sit upside down for a while yeah the clipper baby won that round by a long shot YUM the BIC is still dry now and they were both sitting in a glass of water for about ten minutes and both brand-new and I'm not even getting a spark yet here so hmm maybe I'll just let it hang out hanging upside down for a while and see what happens but the Clipper yeah baby that sucker was so yeah that's kind of a big win right there in my book hmm interesting well let's hope this one gets back at a some point yep there's that so it's been about in five minutes now that they both have been out of the water and still waiting for this big to dry maybe there's a trick to starting it I don't know yeah I think you gotta let it hang upside down if you know one you know you should let me know it so whatever this was the one that was in the water and it's ready to go um so yeah I just wanted to give you guys a heads up about the Clipper or the mini Clipper if you didn't know about it they come in translucent very fillable you can reflect them by taking this out you could use this by itself just to start your your stuff if you wanted you know so there's that it's pretty cool you know I'm kind of jazzed about it you know cuz I just have a ton of lighters just sitting around doing nothing that I won't take with me again cuz I'm not sure how much is in them but now you know I could just refill this and it's you saw the water test still waiting for just such a dry mmm so anyway there it is the mini clipper versus the mini bic thanks for watching you", "4u_3gzLO9NU": "[Music] [Music] hey gay its Tony again I've received a ton of emails since I put out the video on the survival fire kit by backwoods biker the SF k1 and the questions were why do I not have a lighter included in that kit well what's included in that kit is a Ferro rod with a striker it's attached with a lanyard that can also act as a tinder source and then the heart and soul of the SF k1 are the cakes that we make they're made out of cotton they have some wax in them they have all kinds of very flammable wood that's inside of these things I'll push it out let you see it okay now that's that's a that's one right there you see that and then when you cut a piece of this off you know he just fluff up the cotton they'll burn in the in the rain they'll start in the rain they're very very reliable and I learned that formula from my father many many years ago watching him do it I've adjusted a little bit he used dried corn cobs and I believe kerosene with his so we've taken another dimension just to make it a little more reliable especially during times of moisture so the question is why don't I have the lighter inside of the kit all right first of all I do give you an ignition source inside of that kit they work very fine but I do carry a lighter with me all the time and then with my bigger kits that I carry out for you know for extended periods of times then I'll put a lighter in there the question was a bit lighter all right and the answer is absolutely not I do not recommend taking out big lighters out into the bush unless you absolutely have to if you have time to plan for it and you can get yourself together then I'm going to show you something that is a great alternative now the reason I don't like these number one is that the flame is very susceptible to the wind so if you're down trying to get near your tinder bundle you're trying to get down into your nest or ever and light your source it might blow out and they do a lot you know and then you've got to do a lot of finagling to get that going let's say that the wind isn't a problem but you want to put it down inside of something to light it you see what happened that your thumb is gonna get burned because the flame just naturally comes up the weights that's just what nature does with that type of a flame they are susceptible to mechanical breakdown because of the wheel and the triggering system that lets off the fuel okay in the pack Rome I've had friends clout and have their lighter somehow open up and all the all the fuel is escaping weather why they do that and then they're without a lighter okay those are a few reasons why I don't okay now let me show you what I do take out with me regards to a lighter and I guarantee you of Daniel Boone would have had the opportunity to own one of these he would have it because I think Daniel Boone and all the frontiersman usually had the best of what was available especially if they were pros going out into the and into the wilderness I use a cigar lighter this particular cigar lighter is only $11 they do make cigar liners that are much more expensive when you know they have profiles like like this real tiny ones this is just a little bit bigger alright but $11 versus for the thin ones you know like forty forty five dollars these are great to have they are refillable they are adjustable flames they're very reliable in regards to whatever mechanics they have and you really have to pull down in order to release the fuel so you don't have any problem with doing that but this is the best thing about this a cigar lighter is a jetted flame all right you see that right there even when I turn it sideways or I turn it upside down that thing is still going and it isn't going to burn you the jet is directing the flame and the hottest part of the flame down into your fuel source or whatever you're trying to ignite in the wind they're pretty good alright so that's the reason why I don't take a Bick but I do take a cigar lighter they're very reliable and they'll get you done listen if you like these little videos hit that subscribe button down there on the right and hit

triple flame lighter but you get this whole little setup which is pretty cool and I'll go over everything in the review so first thing we have is this nice carry case okay hard plastic you know right over a car or all kinds of crap it's good to go through pretty much everything you want to unless you're purposely trying to break it it's not going to break does have a lanyard on it I personally would take it out because I don't use something like this but if you want to even carry it on your wrist or attach to another bag or something if you want to hang on the outside we have these two clasps okay in the front very sturdy you know lock on these and when they snap down they really snap down pretty good alright you do have a spot on the side here to throw a padlock if you want so if you wanted to lock this case up to keep everything inside from grubby hands you can certainly do so but anyway once we pop this case open we'll find a couple things alright first thing is this little instruction booklets which tells you how to fit lighter and all that kind of stuff warranty information things like that so there you go there's were two contact information if you want to contact them directly alright so in this this pouch here first thing you notice is this yellow piece this yellow piece is a removable rubber seal okay this keeps the container this whole box of waterproof okay which is very very cool alright also keeps it airtight as well now you'll find two things here obviously we have this contraption we'll go over in a second but most importantly we have the lighter all right because this review is basically on the lighter but just happens to come with all this other stuff so first let's talk about the lighter let's move this little stuff out away for a moment so here's a lighter see black ops now this one is kind of a pewter grayish silver with black now there were a couple different versions of this it was a black version there was a very nice like sage green there's a desert brown and there's a silver now the color would be where you see the black here so all the models have the same front design and look but I was just briefly looking at it and the only other color color that's available at the moment or in stock from buy lighters calm which is of course where I got this one I'll put a link in the description box to this but currently looks like they only have the black and the brown alright so here's the lighter it's it's very comfortable in the hand the whole back here is rounded you can see the overall shape if I give you a top view of that but very comfortable in the hand okay how to use this lighter is basically push this down and as you're pushing this down this lid will lift up and then the flame will come in here all right I'll get that it's a second but it is a butane lighter there's your filling nozzle right there okay and you can also adjust this see the two notches just take your flat-head screwdriver you adjust it turn it towards the plus sign for a higher flame and towards the minus to lower the flame there's your body screw if you want to take it apart and look at the inside or to fix it yourself but I wouldn't ever recommend fixing your own lighters unless it's a real cheap lighter I wouldn't bother can I send it to the factory and they'll fix it or replace it but anyway it's pretty cool about this lighter is it has a built-in punch cutter alright basically this little nib on the end you lift that up and it Springs out just like that and there's your punch cutter what is a punch cutter if you do not know it is for cigars so you take your cigar and the rim of this is sharpened okay so you take your cigar and you push it on to the edge here and give a little twist as you're pushing and it will cut out a little section like that okay to prep your cigar for smoking makes the perfect little hole in the end it's a very standard sized punch cutter it's very cool - very effective if you're a cigar smoker it's a very good thing to have if you're not a cigar smoker it's not going to be as useful to you but of course you can punch a hole that shape and size into whatever you want but it's meant for cigars but it packs away nice and neat here the sharp edge is obviously not exposed at all it's towards the inner handle alright so you're not going to cut yourself or anything on it and it does stay in there very secure no matter how hard you get to shake that you're not going to open it up accident all right and it is a sturdy hinge so even if you're pushing very hard with your cigars you're not going to snap that easily all right so it's pretty cool little feature on the lighter it is a triple flame lighter now I'm gonna open this just enough to show you the inside but not light it you can hear that that's all the gas coming out but if I open it's just a crack you'll see our three separate jets then they all work in unison to create one big flame but there are three individual flames now as you open this old away it will lift the lid release the fuel and then click which gives you a spark which lights the fuel and gives you fire so all in one motion all right there you go very cool very strong triple play awesome alright having all that surface area is really good for lighting your cigars or toasting them because they do happen to have at least most of them are larger okay yes you have smaller cigars like cigarillos which you would light as if you were lighting a cigarette brittle RC cars are thicker gauges different ring sizes you have a lot of surface area so to take a regular flame lighter and to go around it takes a little bit longer it's not a big deal but having something like this with those triple Jets like that it makes it very easy to toast the end of your cigar and get it going of course if you don't smoke a cigar and you want the lighter for something else it just provides more fire in one area so it makes many things very effective whether you're lighting fireworks or whatever doesn't make a difference it's very effective now the the ignition button here is pretty cool there's three little raised areas for grip okay but when I use this later I don't tend to do it like that although you can it's very comfortable you can use any finger it doesn't take much pressure to slide it and open it but I tend to use this little shelf here you can see how it sticks out protrudes quite a bit that gives you a very positive grip on it so I surpassed this and I just go right for the tip of my thumb and grab that and it works beautifully so it's really really cool alright now that's just a lighter in addition to the lighter you get the case of course like I showed you we could also get this thing this thing is a cigar guillotine cutter alright we flip it over and you'll see the two blades so we have the housing here and then each side moves independently but you hold it like this and then you put your cigar in here and I'm going to move my finger and then you snip off the end okay now what's unique about this one is most guillotine cutters are a flow-through design so you can you know pick exactly where you want to cut off your cigar this has an actual plate on the back okay so this is either a pro or a con depending on what your your stylist of cutting a cigar but I think this is great particularly for beginner cigar smokers because they may not be used to using something like this and this will give you a very consistent cut every single time because when you put a cigar in here's another scar I'll use the demo they can only go in so far whereas if you're new to using one it has a free-floating or you know flows through design you can cutting off too much and end up making you know the other end look like that as opposed to just taking off a little bit so I'll show you how much this actually cuts on this fresh cigar okay these blades are razor-sharp and the only purpose for this tool is to cut the cigar but again the house cigars come is just like that you can't just light the end and smoke it you need to you know remove the outer layer of tobacco or paper to be able to let the smoke flow through so this is how this is going to look and how you'd use it put to push this against the plate all right squeeze till those you'll feel a little resistance once it hits the cigar and just continue squeezing and it will snip off a little piece off the end okay which is right there you can see they are razor sharp like razor blades alright so there's your little end you remove that and now you have an exposed end of your cigar so you can smoke all right as opposed to the punch cutter which I prefer punch cutter it just makes a cleaner awesome hole I just like the way they work but some people do prefer this style of cutter either way it's going to be very effective and you'll get your cigars ready to go alright so you have that you have your lighter and you have this case now this piece is pretty cool because it can serve basically three purposes one is to house all your stuff if you want to just travel with your little kit here and you know on the go wherever you want to be maybe bring your cigars or whatever you're using your lighter for but I wouldn't do this okay I would use this case for two purposes first of all I take the lighter out and this out alright I would just store these wherever I want them but what's cool is that you can remove this insert this hole insert pulls right out alright and notice there's two there's an extra piece of foam here and they have ridges in it as well as the top has ridges in it you can see there's two pieces of tape here double-sided tape so you'd undo the little covering and you can actually just stick this to the bottom and ensure that it will not move and this turns into a travel cigar-case all right this is a little humidifier okay so you would moisten this and this would keep your cigars moist so they wouldn't dry out again remember we have that air airtight seal on this and waterproof seal okay so now you can fit your cigars in here of course you are limited on size you cannot do very long cigars although you can do different gages doesn't matter if it's skinnier like this or a fatter gauge it will accommodate some pretty fat cigars but not very very long ones all right and you can load up with four cigars as you could say and you close it up and you're ready to go now you have a travel cigar case which i think is awesome but because although I do enjoy an occasional cigar it is very rare that I smoke cigars I won't use this for this purpose okay but instead I'll leave the foam in here and I'll just have a protective case for whatever I want I could put anything here I could put some Zippo stuff in here I could put maybe two or three knives in here if I want to travel with knives you know close the case I could throw a lock on if I want I don't feel it's necessary because if someone were to steal the stuff inside it is still old case it's not that big I think it's very cool you have some different options here all right if you wanted to you could pull the top out here this is kind of glued in but if you definitely did not want to ever use this for a cigar case you could pull this foam out you can pull out the humidifier and the bottom piece now you just basically have a hard plastic shell that's waterproof and airtight for whatever kind of goodies you want to store in there but I think this is really cool it's just it's an awesome set the whole thing I think the lighter is cool itself but this whole thing the case the lighter the cutter the whole deal is on sale right now for $33.99 and there is free shipping on most of the stuff on the site again this was from buy lighters calm the link will be directly to this but of coursing a chop round they carry Zippos and stuff people are constantly asking me good sources for Zippos online and there's plenty of really good sites but this is just another trustworthy site that I've personally used many times in the past so if you're interested check it out but for 34 bucks I think the lighters are awesome for $34 I think it's a very good high quality lighter but the addition of the case and the cutter and everything it's just pretty cool it's a great little setup so I want to do a review on it I love it I will continue to love it and like I said I'm not going to store my lighter in here I'll take the lighter out I'll take the cutter out I'm not gonna use the cutter very often because again I'm not a huge cigar smoker and if I were to cut them I would use the punch cutter but I'll use this case for something else for all kinds of goodies so that's all just want to do a review on this a lot of people showed some interest so I figured I'd do a video on so thanks for watching guys I appreciate it I certainly hope you know if you get this you'll give me your opinions on it post your comments down below if you haven't already have this let me know what you think of it as far as the lighter longevity you know will it have issues in the future if it does I will certainly give you an update like anything else five problems in the future I'll let you know about it but anything that I've ever reviewed before not just lighters even knives if everything has been the same and my opinions have not changed you won't see update videos on it but if things do go wrong or something breaks and I don't like it or you know maybe doesn't hold fuel very good or something like that I'll certainly let you know so that's all thanks for watching appreciate your time as always hope you guys enjoy the rest you day take care of", "6qpSWqPlMcA": "since the 90s the lighter

material that is self extinguishing flexible on impact without cracking resistant to extreme temperatures the gas is isobutene in liquid form it is a gas that provides less pressure than gas commonly used in other lighters propane and butane this lower pressure provides greater security for the user flama gas has developed its own unique and exclusive flame valve with a constant flame height ensuring greater safety and stability the incorporation of the child-resistant mechanism when necessary all clipper lighters comply with the ISO 9990 for safety standard and other international standards compliance is secured by 45 checkpoints during and after the production process this includes clippers flame height controls micro leak control lighting and after burn control and many others to ensure the quality and use a safety of our product as the Clipper lighter has more than exceeded expectations in its various trials it has become a brand that can ensure a unique level of quality laboratory comparisons between a clipper and a low-quality lighter make the difference clear flame height two minutes of continuous flame [Music] flammability test internal pressure [Music] temperature for hours at 65 degrees drop test these six tests you've just seen imitate conditions lighters can be exposed to in real life as you'll have seen not all lighters perform equally a lighter is a mass produced article that contains high pressure and due to this requires special attention on the part of the manufacturer any quality problem can also become a safety problem for the consumer with a clipper you'll always be guaranteed a product with the highest quality and safety standards on the market we hope that after seen this video you'll be more aware of the risks involved in buying a generic cigarette lighter the decision is yours lights with clipper for its quality for your safety you", "lVlUhhe2nic": "what's going on guys so today I'm just sharing a couple of Zippos that I got in a trade this was a multiple item trade I traded a single knife I think it was a wee model for these four zip bows and a truck ham all right so pretty cool I mean these suppose aren't ones I'm gonna be using these are purely just to throw in the collection they're all brand new they still have their retail stickers on it which is pretty cool first they still have you know safety sticker on the back so then these were opened so just catch something real quick you know some people who enjoy the cipro related content you know something new to look at so this one here is a obviously blue sapphire Zippo in fact I think these models that are on the back here pertain to the actual Zippo so for example this one is a two zero four four six if you look that up it's just a plain blue sapphire and right but then obviously the design on it could be multiple things in this case tribal Ace of Spades right so very cool little combo there don't like it this one is from 2015 I'll see you next one here see we have this cool blue dragon now for I understand the person who sent it to me said that his buddy is a Zippo dealer out in California that he designed a couple of these you know designs III pretty sure I've seen a couple of designs but I think what's possible is that the Zippo dealers the authorized dealers can do different combinations for example a blue dragon that's on this brass case might be a specific combination that was all available you know in his particular shop where he sells it Bo's you know but I like this a lot the base here model is to 0 for B I mean for brass and obviously this one's the dragon and blue alright so you might find this simple out there somewhere for sale and it looks the same but it has a black dragon you know we're in this case there's a red dragon this is a different type of dragon but uh you know there's a ton of different variants on these but I like that these sides are polished up off you can really tell the front and the back are flat so it's a flat finish alright and then on the sides bottom top it's polished up which is really cool so this one is also one well this one's 2018 so we have 2015 2018 next one here is that Tiger which is very cool very much like a tribal tattoo I mean these three here all look like political tattoos to me but you can see the same thing to o4b so all three of these are that model it's basically that brass model all right this one's a tiger with barbed wire mm-hmm they see the barbed wire frame there alright and this one is from 2018 as well so I'm assuming that this last one's from cleaning teen like this the red dragon and yes 2018 very cool though if you guys can tell me I don't know what this character means it's on the the red one as well but the stickers covered a little bit but it has the exact same character on the bottom so anyone who can read that be cool to find out what that exactly says anyway I just wanted to share that with you guys I'm still very much into Zippos and still collect them what ends up happening is like when I do a trade and I get Zippos like right now it's kind of you know really boosting the interest in looking for more suppose so I found myself by looking online today earlier on eBay just to see what's out there so even though I have a bunch of different hobbies and I enjoy them all at the same time I do definitely focus in on different things and for me it makes it exciting you know for example Zippos right this is a great example I love suppose you know there was a time where I was so focused on suppose for like a year straight I just wanted to get every Zippo possible and I had all these different collections and want to get really rare ones and things and that was awesome but what happened was I was so focused on it all the time eventually it got a little bit mundane it's never really boring because I do like the Hobby just like knives knives will never be boring to me at all and but occasionally people ask me you know why don't you just make Knight videos why do you do this o stuff cuz I have a lot hobbies if I just talked about knives 24/7 every single day it wouldn't be as exciting so when I you know skip to something else and come back to it it just it keeps these passions alive so you know right now it just happens to be Zippos when pinch these together give you another show that you know so this is piquing my interest in Zippos again so like hop online look for some other ones might or might not end up bidding on one you know but it's just fun it's exciting anyway that's it for now guys just want to do I'll share these Zippos there one case you happen to like a design they are out there like I said you might find a variant you know me maybe I'll fly in this type design but it's not on a brass lighter the design might be on a stainless lighter or maybe it's a different color and so forth like I said there's so many different Zippo designs out there it's endless really it's very cool because the base lighter a lot of people enjoy but obviously get an image that represents you or something that you really like you know these all have something in common in that they're all tribal alright so this is like a mini collection within a collection and that's another reason I like Zippo collecting so much is because you can focus on one specific thing you know so anyway that's it hope you guys have a wonderful day and I will see you tomorrow with a brand new video take care", "qkhQ1KwqyT0": "what's up guys it's black Scout survival and today we're going to talk about how to how to remove the child safety off of a big lighter and you can see here you know taking that piece off makes it increasingly easier to light a Bic you know they used to come like this but I guess you know rules and this and that regulations made it prohibit them from doing that that way you have to push down on this to actually get it lit take this something beguine see there you know I mean it's not a real big deal but you know I like to have them off so let's go ahead and do that and basically I have one here and all you're going to do is you're going to tell you like all or something from your multi-tool or screwdriver something you're going to dig it right in to this section here and get it up under there like that and then you're just going to draw it in and pull it up you can see it's coming out and you'll need to get it out past that section there and it will pop off just like that so now that's removed but uh that's how you do it and check out black Scout siwalik on for more

couple of mini knives that I keep with them and I've been collecting these little guys for a while now and they people seem to like them and it's been a while since I've done a collection video and I've recently got a couple new ones of these in so I figured maybe I would just do a vid here on my back patio enjoying the weather I guess really I'll start with the first one I got starting in about 2010 was this guy looks like it needs some wood it's a side switchblade kind of cool fires pretty good and I got this guy which is a common common when you see nowadays a lot of these I haven't used as a lighter in a long time the out the front looks pretty good moving along I picked up this one this is not a lighter keychain model like this would call it a chain knife lighter knife cool looking handle this one looks somewhere to that win getting m16 rifle there on the back like this one Slyder no but works good though this one is cool it's like a double-barrel these would work if I would put some butane in them works good this one's still in the box 1997 Hong Kong commemorative pretty cool it's got a I guess some money there from Hong Kong to buttons on the fire and then one to close it again that's a pretty cool one I got this one actually I bought it Walley world while back I thought it looked cool just newest one it works good get it get out bottle opener corkscrew little blade that's kinda neat I got a couple mini knives here I keep living little stiletto what's blade a couple little butterfly knives like you used to see it's a fair little crane games pretty good little collection going here and I wanted to make this kind of a short video people always lose attention span anyway so that's my lighter knife / mini 9 / teaching knife slash out the front knife collection and I picked these up pretty much any chance I can get there you see them here and there they're not super common but I mean you see them like on eBay and stuff at sales stuff I grab them so kind of a sucker for this tiny little stuff so I appreciate you guys watching I'll put a link to my Instagram below if you want to check that out and I appreciate it guys I'll catch on an excellent", "pkYvsEdPje0": "what's going on YouTube I know I said I'd do a video of my entire lighter collection quite some time ago but it was actually pretty hard to round up if you're like me you probably have lighters that you've collected over the years just about everywhere so finally got an opportunity to clean up the house a little bit organizing things and I would say this is a good 80% of my lighters there's still a box missing with some Zippo that kind of some older lighters that I picked up at flea markets but this is kind of a bulk of the collection as far as the nicer stuff and the stuff I've collected more recently but I'll just get started kind of explaining to you and show you what I've got here so the first lighters right here this lighter here was the very first lighter I ever purchased and probably won't buy it yet so I do not rehearse this I do not prepare so some of these are going to have fluid in on some of them or not um just to let you guys know I don't actually smoke but I just like having a lighter and I like to fidget with them but that one I bought from a store called Long's drugs I don't think they're in the business anymore but in the San Francisco Bay Area and I remember being 12 or 13 had a paper out had a few bucks walked in and they sold me a Zippo lighter out of the countering it's all been collecting from there this lighters here was a flea market pick up again I don't know too much about these but you guys could take a look at another Zippo and pretty cool item all of these do work at one time or another they were up and up and running and here's the other zipper this is actually pretty new I forgot why I purchased this but I think it was one of those situations where I had to add $20 to a cart to get free shipping or something and I ended up with that lighter so harley-davidson lighter actually I hadn't opened this in a while so he do have not a box of lighters or mostly Zippos it's kind of cool mostly Zippos because I know I had a lighter that I was given to it from the 96 Olympics and I know I had a Mustang lighter so there's a box around here somewhere with a bunch zip O's and kind of some old flea market pickups but like I said this is kind of the the bulk of the collection that I have now um this is a cool little lighter this was a dunghill sulphide and I do believe this one does work perfect and I love the old mechanical lighters like this just so cool and this is silver so I do have to polish this every now and then so that's why I know it it does work this is an old lighter cardi a in a pretty brand loyal guys so pretty much all the lighters I've ever purchased it that I collected would be Zippo cardi a that done those kind of a one-off unique one but I have collected a bunch of Cartier's and of course FTD ponds and here's another Cartier and this one was pretty cool because I actually collect Mont Blanc pen and that one matched up really really well with the Mont Blanc line where they do the end the lacquer on on the goal they look very cool and this one was one of my favorites I don't know it's just so cool crocodile looking and this is the new style lighter in fact I don't even think this as a splinter that it doesn't I have not put anything in this but pretty cool I haven't had a chance to use this kind of a little bit heavier than usual but kind of a unique shape but I just like the look of it and so that was kind of my car da so here are the St DuPont I did kinda collect double-oh-seven stuff I'm a big fan of James Bond I love all the movies so you'll see in kind of the STD ponds are themed for the James Bond this was the very first torch James Bond it doesn't work that has not had feeling it for years it still works so that's shows you the quality of St DuPont there and this is the Casino Royale you can see it has a pattern to it wow that's one of those work to this one I actually do use so I know that this world fox if this doesn't find it that'd be funny now this one I do use for cigars every now and then but that's this is just a normal normal jet lighter well this year this was just a cutter this was pretty cool this is a double-oh-seven how you let's cut cigars spectrum right there and you guys have probably seen the video of this guy here just a little quick line to and I actually have two of these because this is my favorite lighter and I just really liked the look of it and it's the James Bond of course this is the secrets of our playing here so if you if you turn it out it actually has two that two areas where the flame comes out so it actually will get a little wider versus just getting a little taller so it's pretty cool but this is a double-oh-seven lighter that I can sit up the airplane manner that came out for the movie Casino Royale which is actually really good movie so I bought two of those so this one I pretty don't know it doesn't look that cool again I have not I haven't fired this thing up for years and years so that's the fires off so these are pretty good quality twelve geysers this is the latest movies lecture so this lighter about this when that movie came out so I thought this one was really cool because you can actually see a seeker this a big hole in the lighter and of course that's uh for the James Bond gun barrel and of course you had to get the black one as well put the set just find out that's pretty cool let's teach upon the top Specter logo double-oh-seven on the side and I believe one of these so one of them is flame height adjustment again I want us to fill it and one of them to the secret compartment so and they're limited to what I remember they're limited to alright guys well I hope you enjoyed a very quick review of my current lighter collection if you guys have any questions please feel free ask thanks I had to add this onto the video because as I was putting the lighters away I saw that I didn't include this in the video I left us in there this lighter has been with me for one of the longest periods of time I actually got this one I believe on my 21st birthday in Vegas when I won of a wild winning spree and bought this lighter and it's been with me ever since as a reminder of luck so you can see it is a pretty beat to hell and I didn't feel like it was a fair lighter collection video without showing this one so thanks", "zEG8fMnUUjU": "people always telling me that I should make youtube videos so people like some of the [ __ ] I figure out so this is the first one I guess I'm sure you've seen people refill big lighters and in the bottom here so I think it she did that is though that it all Springs everywhere in [ __ ] right so I figured out a way to get around that I'll glue it where this I do a deal like this so you see the part Liu he now the trick is because you want this [ __ ] to stick right the trick is to eat up make sure the wires heated up over to such sticks because if it's cold it didn't stick and then look it's okay look don't look at that right then just right on there like that look see that okay you don't see this horse now okay so what I did is I just I just smooth it out flat right now the reason why I did that was because I want the tip of the butane to form a solid contact with the lighter so they didn't spray everywhere right we're waiting so we've got to try and sends a great long at all oh yeah and by the way just a go right in the center see that where a public actually does it but they're in the middle okay so if anybody anybody [ __ ] anybody's done this before knows that you know there's a how big does it is the put a little little ball bearing I can tell you a little ball in there they fill it and they shove this ball in there there's plastic and it forms a seal like that now in a perfect world also if you if I really I was wanted to fill this up properly what I would do is I would put the fighter in the freezer because that would make the low the temperature of lighter and I think detainee boils at around minus 40 Celsius I think which is 40 Fahrenheit I think whatever anyway so if you have this in freezer for a while they won't they won't the pressure won't really it won't really spray out anyway because the pressure will be a little boiling point because it's the temperature we will employ the point which means the pressure won't even be there so this is just like water basically at the right temperature okay so no strike so so I just go right in the middle right where that ball is right right there Lexi and then just enough where shake it you can hear the ball anyway so I know that works the case is look much so now where that hole is right down there like okay right there okay looks I'm from I'm putting pressure on it did you get in there this there's gas going in it I know I did the edge of this right it's it's really up this is crazy how all this works watch you do that little snap areas pretty soon like that okay sorry now okay I think what I did that time put too much pressure on it and fitting to his pressure on it I kind of like made the hole I made with the pin collapse on itself so it wasn't a lot of you guys look good to flow in their well-being because then again slowly not gonna work to see his making a view of it right so let's try the status universe it's not I'll just read a little video right [Music] oh and by the way it also does something else with the seal there you go [Music] see that let's it's it's actually wow it's actually got a lot in it a lot like a lot lot that's pretty cool got that much in there so there you go that's that I'll put up more videos with more weird random nonsense that I figure out", "JRnBISFcI6M": "hello guys welcome to our Channel we have reviewed a list of the best butane lighters out here

been on the run for months apparently and is nine scaley bourgeois joins us live tonight with more on the suspect who currently has 16 warrants out for his arrest Kayleigh you know this guy's accused of burglarizing 13 convenience stores in the area including the one behind me in about a month period of time and his method and target always seem to be the same video shows 61 year old Paul Maxie at the goodies on 63rd grabbing the display case of lighters and taking off an Oklahoma City police say he's done this 13 times over the period of about a month earlier this year he was going into convenience stores and gas stations and stealing not only packages of lighters but the entire display Maxie is wanted for stealing lighters from 13 convenience stores in the metro area many in the Northwest portion of the city reports show Maxie would sometimes even start a conversation with the victims before allegedly grabbing the lighters and running away police say his loot is worth two thousand dollars that's about a thousand lighters class and Mart even started putting their lighters and protective casing because of Maxie I don't know why he would steal these lighters it like I said it's very unusual and I don't know what the draw for these particular items are regardless of Maxie's motive police want to find him they identified him as the suspect thanks to surveillance video yes he does have a history an arrest history with us Maxie hasn't been his last known address since the storing of larsson 'is this winter police say he was often seen driving this gray Dodge Charger with damage to the front end it was over a period of a month and this was several months ago and we haven't been able to locate him and take him into custody since then those who know where the big bandit could be are asked to call CrimeStoppers really the only strange variation we're seeing in these different crimes is some of the convenience store owners say that maxi was working with an accomplice others say he acted alone on the scene on the story in Oklahoma City Keely bushwah news 9 that is a strange", "pBVub2-vf6M": "the other day i was reading some accounts from the war in bosnia and seems that one of the most valuable items a person would have with them was their lighter of course it was used for starting for lighting fires for heat for cooking and such but also for finding their ways around the hallways when there was no light of course this was back in the 90s i think 95 96 so there was not the kind of led technology but it's still true that even with a lighter you can have a little bit of light and find your way up around a dark place guys this is fernando doing another video for more survivalist this case showing you the clipper lighter now we all have lighters in our kids in our in our emergency bags and such some of us carry lighters on daily basis even if we don't smoke just we have we like having the possibility and appreciate the capacity of starting fires and having a flame available it's still pretty pretty nice but we generally get by with disposable lighters and those are just fine you know big lighters are good quality in general but sometimes there's there's better stuff out there and sometimes it's actually for pretty much the same price these are a little bit more expensive these clipper lighters but even you know these this one costs i think 199 in amazon right now but sometimes you can snatch it for as much as typical disposable layers and in this case it's not a disposable layer it's actually good quality it's refillable you can refill it it's translucent so you can see well it does come in different colors so this one is a transparent one and the other ones may not be as visible i like this one because you can see how much fuel you have left but thinking about that about these accounts of the war in bosnia and and the different um accounts of of people is saying the same thing that you know lighter was a valuable object back then and i can completely see how it could be again so for just almost same money maybe a little bit more you get something that is better quality it's not just refillable you can also replace the flint you see you can remove the entire setup there and screw it and set the flint again back in place it's also the material this looks you know like ordinary plastic this is actually nylon polymer 66 which according to manufacturers is it's better and they run tests so as to check how resistant it is it's also a flame retardant so if you think of it from that perspective you know a guy in a hallway with a cheap disposable lighter doing this keeping it on and finding his way around a dark place with a cheaper disposable lighter what happens and you've probably seen this happen sometimes it heats up the plastic heats up and pop the the wheel pops out of place in this case the clipper is pretty interesting the clipper is made of a material that is so resistant to flame that this can actually stay this way for two minutes can actually stay that way for two minutes before it heats so much that the plastic melts and you end up losing the wheel so you see how it is that sometimes quality does make quite a bit of a difference so you know i think it's pretty interesting how for almost as much as a disposable lighter the guys during the bostian war they were refilling these disposable lighters through the main valve so it can be done but i think it's better to have one that it's actually designed that way and the materials are better so as to be reused time again refilling changing the flints especially if the price difference is not that big yeah i'm all for that one of the things i do not like about this slider is that wheel you see how it's like more jagged star-shaped i prefer more of the typical it's not bad on the hand or anything it just feels weird when you're used to the more normal one this is my the jeep lighter which is still one of my favorite ones because of the big button good quality and you know the straight walls allow you to wrap some duct tape around it just exactly so the clipper would be perfect if it didn't have this strange shape here and if it was straight walls you could actually wrap a nice length of of tape around it in a nice format you cannot regulate the flame yet it is it is well made so you have a nice medium-sized flame that it's just perfect for most of your needs so guys just keep in mind this as always i just throw the information out there for you to consider keep in mind if you ever come across a good deal on clipper lighters you know there's they are good stuff made in spain they're made to last and it's a very interesting option for a lighter folks take care have a great day see you in our next video", "QWXrDWkwsow": "hey everybody in work back to diva styles and this video is going to be a template preview and this week I decided to do some custom bic lighters the measurements

bring this number five and that's because has a pretty basic a pretty basic image on it is just like a little boat lobo and is that a sunset it's okay it's it's not really it wasn't my lighter but it was my friend slider and yeah I didn't steal it he left it you left it I'm not a ladder stealer I am NOT the lighters dealer I don't do that that's the only one that I have whatever I light candles indoors and it's a pickle lighter yeah pretty much it's just a pickle on it and it's pretty cool and so also you guys probably didn't know this but if regular lighters they have a little metal thing right here little metal thing right here in the middle which makes it harder to light it or to spark it press down hard and then flick it but little thing in the middle you can actually take it out too so let me see if I can I wish I hadn't taken it out already but all you have to do is lift plus two metal flaps right there take the metal piece out and then press them down and close it again and it makes it so much easier to lay it's like effortless so yeah this one my friend slider and then this one is to be a pickle later they're pretty uh they're pretty new actually I did it this one's almost out because I was this one if has a longest so maybe that's why I chose it last also I've said this one a long time does my friend left it here and he always asked one with him so it's like it just didn't really matter and then this one is it's pretty filled actually I got this one a while back but I've used this one third this is a this is a dinosaur riding um a Vespa in front of the moon it's it's supposed to be recreating like the et thing but it's a little dinosaur and I think that's pretty cool at the same time those I could double back but it's a lot goes a while ago and this is the first one I used so I I kept this one in my car and then I have this one which I keep here at the house oh look this wants to ask the metal thing on it right there and this one doesn't that's that's actually really great Phillipe Shh so this one has the I always thought it was like a child to safety like child protection thing so a child look look okay maybe it doesn't look that dramatic but this is so much easier yeah yeah you gotta press it hard it's all you got to do let me see if I have I have this fork will this work well that's not gonna work okay so basically what you have to do is there's this little silver ring here on top right there wait I see if I can right there there's a little silver ring right there on the top so what you have to do is there's the two metal flaps where the flame comes out of right right there right there so you gotta lift those two metal flaps up this metal thing on top of the wheel is under those two little flaps right there so what you got to do is you gotta lift up those two flaps right here pull the metal out and throw it away and then put the flaps back down so when you do it looks like this one where there's no metal thing there at all it's a little fun fact for you guys if you didn't know that but you know you probably did right there so there's the one that's the metal thing on it right here this one that's the metal thing on this I also in the car with me have a brand on it I don't think but it's it's so so cool ok it's all that makes play here it is oh here it is it says as I Kalou logo on the FRA it says highway of 40 to zero I'm not really sure what that means so but it's really cool because it's one of those up yeah it's one of those I don't love you can see that but yeah it's it's uh it's it's one of those our wind resistant ones Sophia for outside and you want to light a candle uh you could do that with ease just because there's no wind stopping that thing it sounds pretty cool too the only problem with it is that uh it runs out quick but if you look right there I think it's really born right there it should be that's what the lady told me that they're available but even if it's not it was like $2 it was like a dollar 90 which is really really good and uh yeah so I've been using this one a lot I've been carrying around with me literally my buckets every day and it's super convenient and it's a it's like a small black and it's like it's smooth I just really like it and it's a wind resistant that's what I love if you're outside and you're trying to light a candle it's like like no chance but this one's like I know y'all saw that I thought dude that's crazy but yep I just want to show you guys those are my favorite lighters um those are my I just want to show you yeah my top five favorite lighters my three favorite bigs by a favor one right now and then a clipper so yeah that's gonna be it for the video thank you all so much for watching let me just try to get a thumbnail in here really quick yeah this has been a summer job", "Vlg5T96cKT4": "we're gonna be making a good you later well we're not gonna be making it I'm gonna be making it you're gonna be watching and I hope you enjoy first we're gonna measure this and see how much of the fabric we're gonna need see wanna to a line right here should be right there [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] kids widow smoke this is trash here's lighter I hope you guys enjoy a video and I'm thinking about giving this lighter away I don't know yet but thanks for watching and see you on my next video", "XgZ_Le992cQ": "hey youtube just one can make a couple comparisons against the standard sized bic lighter in the script Oh lighter just ignore this tape on here and I also put some just a little bit of electrical tape just to kind of reduce the reflection off this camera because I'm doing some filming indoors just due to the elements outside right now or not to ideal for filming so what we have here today is going to be this is over four years old this particular pic and I use it all the time hundreds and hundreds of times and it still works it's a very amazing piece of gear in fact the tests that have been done on these for continuous burn times have reached an hour and these I don't know there's these are not as popular and to my knowledge there's no tests on them but there could be I'm just not familiar with it but I would this is my hypothesis is that you'll get a much shorter runtime on the scripto than the Bick the BIC is maiya course in France and the script though I do believe is made in China and I think there are some quality differences not only just in the Flint configuration in design even though the scripto does have the adjustable flame feature and you can see in the front there but in terms of the actual Flint the Flint is actually protected on the BIC and I think that's a better quality and a larger piece of Flint if I'm not incorrect there and then the script though is just a an open piece there and while they both work just fine it's easier to compromise the script o than the BIC they both can stop working though if you put them in water for too long but in most cases though if you let them air out and drive they start working again now we reason I say that this script O won't last as long as the big is because of the size and when you look at it you might be saying okay they look about the same size what am I talking about well in terms of the height they both are pretty much the same and so you know the only difference is the script oh the actual of the head here is a little bit taller than the BIC that's just InDesign now what's what gives you a little bit more and it's actually quite a bit more interesting is when you hold these side-by-side now you'll notice there's a little bit of a difference in width in fact it's pretty much noticeable but the big lighter is it is a bit wider I'm not sure about percentage-wise I go so far to say a good 20 to 30 percent at least water now it's even more telling when you took him upside down check this out then one on the bottom obviously is the BIC Wow so you have this oval shape that the actual container that the the lighter fluid is in on the BIC and it held a lot more than the script oh so I think that's just really telling of why maybe it gets so much runtime because it's actually kind of like an optical illusion of how large this container really is in this full-size BIC it just doesn't seem like when you're holding it but when you actually look at it there's actually quite a bit of room there for quite a bit of fluid compared to this which is a different type of oval but it's a lot smaller and I think there's a lot less room in there so these are just my hypotheses and my observations of the BIC and the script oh and either one of these would make a you know fine lighters there's a reason why this Kryptos they typically especially in a multi pack code than be anywhere between 25 cents and 50 cents each and the BIC lighters go from between one and two dollars each now the mini Bix between the dollar and dollar and a quarter so you know you get what you pay for in this situation because I think that the BIC is actually worthwhile and I would probably pick these every day of the week over the scripto but if this is all that you have in your area and this is all that you can afford so be it this is the art of prepping signing out once again we thank you for all of your your comments and subscriptions and for for liking this video and everybody be safe and if you're out and about get you a big", "1acdYK31CIo": "like my package came with a but a little sticker that showed a dude with a bong on it [Music] welcome back survival on purpose my name is Brian thanks for joining me this is gonna be a really quick little video about the Clipper lighter I had a viewer from across the pond if you will from Britain tell me that clipper lighters are been popular in Europe and Great Britain for years and years and years so I thought I'd check him out he said there's some advantages to him check them out I think there are some advantages to them first of all they are refillable so these are butane lighters that are refillable with just standard butane canisters so that means basically they could last you a long long time they also also have the Flint that your little Flint carpenter you pop in and out it's really easy to change the flint unlike a big a big basically is a disposable lighter you throw it away it's done these things are technically disposable lighters but they're also on their refillable so you can use them a long time before you have to dispose of them other things cool about them is they're made of nylon which is not like Bix or made of plastic so once Bix if a big dust catch on fire start burning the plastic itself acts as a fuel nylon however does not act as a fuel when this when the ignition source goes away it quits burning so if you had gases evaporator what I wants to guess was burning this is not gonna keep burning whereas they Bick would basically you know be its own fuel which could be good in a survival situation I don't know the other thing this is got like a see the wheel it's not around it's got ridges on it so you can get really good traction on it I like that they've been making these lighter since 1961 cheaper than Bix to my not my experience I got six of these for like eight bucks so like a buck and a quarter piece or something like at a buck thirty cents apiece they've got all kinds of different colors all kinds of different on different designs the only place I could find these however was only internet here in the USA I think they're extremely common and popular all over the rest of the world but in USA Bix I guess I've got in the market corn but I will tell you that I think the primary one of the primary markets for these guys in the USA at least is among people who might use the alternative smoking materials and because if you look the internet for these things they're all over the place they have a big history they have clubs they have fan clubs they've got all kinds of stuff but they've also they've got a lot of design ones and really psychedelic liquor ones and all that but they're really really small I like the fact that a lot of different colors I like the fact that refillable if you put one of these in your kit or whatever and it starts to run out on you can always fill it up before you go out on a trip you don't have to worry about having a happy empty emergency lighter with you I like the fact that the Flint's are renewable you can change the Flint so it's kind of like a really cheap non disposable lighter and it's just a good solid size flame and you go to their website they got all kinds of testing that they really have done a testing these things are made in Netherlands and the sticker even comes off really easy by the way which is another good thing after seeing the Cold Steel video you might have saw I don't like stickers that don't come off they come off really nice so you get a nice clean look there and it just it's got a pretty good sized flame I'd say that's about an inch and a quarter flames so anyway this can be a quick video I promise you if you're looking for an alternative to a bit that might have some advantages in my opinion it does have some advantages these things been around since 1961 they are tried-and-true they're not some johnny-come-lately so I no bigs have a reputation for quality so do these all over the world so that is the Clipper lighter and it's been a quick little quick shot review from survival on purpose as always thanks for watching survival on

in before the battery died I've got like one minute left on the battery cool [Music]", "FtV2cO1bLt4": "[Music] it's a case for combustion spin the wheel and you have an instant flame flip the lid and the flame is extinguished a version of the lighter first appeared in the 19th century at the time it was more of a conversation piece than anything a curiosity that ignited plenty of interest lighters aren't a novelty anymore but there's still a hot commodity to make lighter cases a machine and coils brass from a spool pulling it to a press the press stamps the brass repeatedly to shape both the top and bottom parts of the case a [Music] worker collects them and places them on a revolving table another worker slides on a hinge to link the top and bottom pieces [Music] an electrode welds the hinge to the case then a mechanical arm knocks them down a chute to a worker who inspects the welding job as the cases move on a conveyor system they get a quick buff to prepare them for plating the lighter cases are now plunged into a series of washing solutions and rinses followed by a nickel solution then a chrome one is the finishing touch for the lighter cases it's time to move on to the inner workings a dye shapes a piece of steel to make the inside cases mechanised arms then place a tube and plate in the case the tube will hold the Flintstone and the plate will form the top of the inner case [Music] the epoxy seals them in place and the cases move through a curing oven to harden the epoxy a worker arranges a pile of Flint wheels so that the teeth are in the proper direction grippers load the Flint wheels into an assembly jig these cams will eventually act as a catch for the lighter lid a grip replaces the cam in the jig beside the Flint wheel the assembly jig now receives little brass eyelets between the Flint wheel and the camp [Music] the Machine slides the inner case over the Flint wheel cam and eyelet and an automated device rivets it all together a machine lowers awake to the eyelet and threads it through blades move in from the side and snip the wick this machine stuffs pieces of cotton into the inner case the cotton will soak up and retain fuel when the consumer adds it later steel plungers tamp down the wick and cotton here add I punch cuts a piece of felt to sighs automated arms pick up the felt and shove it into the top of the inner case here grippers place a flint spring in the case just over the Flintstone pneumatic screwdrivers drive the screw home [Music] a rubber wheel spins the flint and sparks fly as a light sensor checks their intensity after the flint check technicians install the inner unit in the case they check the fit they test the function looks like it's an open-and-shut case lighting a controlled fire was not always easy only 200 years ago you'd rub a rock on steel to create sparks then the stunning discovery that combining certain chemicals can ignite fire putting these chemicals on handy little sticks well nothing quite matches that the first matches left behind an Aussie a ting odour but today they're safer and the smell dissipates in seconds to make match sticks this company starts with recycled paper board which is inexpensive and thick enough to support the weight of chemicals on one end a stamping press partially cuts the paper creating stamps as we see in this view from inside the machine a die first cuts the stems and then a blade slices through the sheet widthwise making strips of 120 stems each at actual speed it's all just a blur as the press makes nearly 500 strips per minute next the strip's move through a bath of hot wax it soaks into the stems about one-third of the way up then they draw in an oven for 15 seconds when you light a match the watch slows down the burn speed of the chemicals sustaining the flame for four or five seconds those chemicals are gelatin and silica to bind the chemicals to the stick potassium chlorate and animal protein glue for oxidation sulfur to fuel the flame and to fillers [Music] they mix 317 kilos of the chemicals in a large vat with hot water this is enough to make the chemical batter for 25 million match heads a conveyor runs the matchsticks through the batter to coat their tips three rollers in the tank raised the surface of the batter the first to ensure the front and back of the heads get covered the third rotates faster to remove excess batter as the heads leave the tank from there the matchsticks travel a distance of 365 meters while fans air dry them the factory temperature is a comfortable 22 degrees Celsius just what's required for the chemicals to dry and Harden these minerals are silica and red phosphorus add a little glue and you've got what's called friction the material in the strip you rub the match against to make the head ignite to make these striker strips as they're called a steel wheel rolls friction onto paper that's moving through a cutting press this isn't the same paper from which they make the matchsticks it's a higher quality non recycled paper suitable for color graphics because many clients order custom printed matchbook covers [Music] another press with rotary blades slices through the paper creating segments that are ten point seven centimeters long that's the length of an unfolded matchbook now back to the matchsticks a worker arranges the strips into layers of two a conveyor then feeds them into a machine that will attach them to the matchbook covers the machine performs several tasks it cuts the matchsticks strips into rows of ten matches each and it cuts the matchbook covers to their final width of 3.8 centimeters [Music] [Applause] [Music] the machine folds the matchbook covers over two rows or 20 matches then inserts one strong staple through all four layers next a conveyor moves the assembled matchbooks to another machine that counts them and creates two side-by-side rows of 25 ready for boxing this company also makes its boxes out of recycled paper board each one holds 50 match books and sells for about a buck that's a dollar for 1,000 matches or just a penny to light up 10 times [Music]", "y0CJjIzfOWE": "hey guys well I want to apologize excuse me I uploaded my novelty lighter video part 1 and I made it part 2 okay and I started uploading it and I left to do something I came back and I thought that it was done because the Page said it was done and apparently it wasn't but I never checked so I went and I deleted off my you know off my computer and then someone asked hey where's part 2 and I went well I think I uploaded it and I checked and it wasn't there and now I just deleted it so I don't have it anymore so this is what this is I'm reef filming it so please accept my apologies for I guess the kind of tease these little ideas I have left I'll try to go over these fairly quickly first one looks like a pack of camels obviously a lot smaller top flips up you have two cigarettes here or what appear to be cigarette bucks and you push those down of course the flame would come out of here there's no fluid left then here is actually one of my favourite lighters love this lighter this is actually I believe was an Australian army issue lighter they make a lot of different variations of this this one specifically won't be able to show you with detail but the bottom is its marked IMC Oh xxx okay so IMC oh I guess is the brand xxx would be in the model all in the bottom it says Patton Austria and that says super-sick 700 so I guess actually 6 700 is probably the model but I love this lighter because you can kind of field-strip it to clean it it's entirely made out of aluminum basically you have a little ring here okay which act as a flue you can push that down well actually let me just show you how it works the top part is hinged and when you open the top as you're opening it you get the spark okay it's just one motion and of course your fuel would be in this canister in the bottom which comes down pulls out your canister your wick that pokes at the top pull the base off you have all your you know on the inside so you put your leg or fluid in here regular standard lighter fluid like using a Zippo or any other you know lighter like that put your cap on okay slide this through the bottom and just push down on this and with light now when you're using a lighter you would open the flue so that oxygen and air can can get all you know where the flame is so it obviously air feeds the fire and when it's not in use you can slide this back up so that dirt and stuff don't get in there you know when you're out in the field really really cool but also one of the other features I love about this is that changing the Flint all you do is you push down on this square part it's like a button okay it's got a little spring you push down and lift this way okay and this piece I just don't want to do it fast to have the Flint fall out this whole piece hinges up okay you pull this this part down okay and there's a little chamber in here almost like a almost like a gun alright and I'm just going to tap on this till the Flint falls down and it's right there it's very very hard to see I'll actually I'll pop it out you see there my hands okay the Flint goes right in this little little tiny chamber so just drop that in right there and then I just want to make sure it's straight pushed it up here and push that back up okay push that up pull the back down you should be ready to go so it's really really easy to you know take this apart to clean it if you need to you know obviously a little different parts you know flu comes down pop the back off so you can kind of feel strip this and you know if you need to take it apart really fast to clean it like I said it's all aluminum so it's extremely light just really cool lighter very interesting see that's one here I have see brands is tanita ta n ITA just says Japan this is like a cigar style lighter top flips up and you have a your strikers on the side here like a wheel okay and that's how you strike it typically the flames going to come out sideways so typically use this for like a pipe lighter excuse me I said cigar but I'm in pipe on this with this style lighters for that aside here there's a little throwaway lighter but unique design this back here it's kind of like a sleeve and it's got some ribbing on as you see for for grip and basically you put your thumb there's more almost like textured dots which is hard to make out but put your thumb here and your forefinger on the back okay and by pushing your thumb forward like this that's what actually lights the lighter okay that's the button so basically if you're holding the back part you're pushing a lighter forward or if you're holding reverse you're pulling this down so so that was pretty interesting and came in a bunch of different colors but I just grabbed this kind of teal next one here this does not actually come out at all it's all one piece but obviously just looks like a curly okay no corona a little throw away next one here another risk a tight lighter just push down the side lever here and there's actually supposed to be an LED in the front here that just blinks next one very simple looks like a hammer why would you have a layer looks like a hammer I don't know maybe your contractor who smokes there's no fluid left but obviously you see there that's the let's how you would light it next one is a camel lighter and actually this lighter this is actually I think a giveaway with you know similar Marlboro miles whatever the camel bucks that's what it was and this was one of your rewards for you know camel bucks next slider here it's actually just an insert to a lighter front says Berkeley the back actually says flashlight company of America Jersey City New Jersey made in America what I like about this actually I really wish this fit inside of a Zippo because this has a Zippo style lighter but it's completely sealed inside you have two screws here okay when they're marked one is for filling and the other one is for Flint so you would unscrew this here and of course you would put in your lighter fluid okay but what's really cool is the back of this this little screw has another head you know screw head on it you unscrew that there's a little hidden spot you can keep an extra Flint I thought that was really really cool but unfortunately this insert is a little bit too big for a regular Zippo otherwise I'd use it I have no idea what the case was like this came in a lot on eBay so I have no idea what that looks like see you next one here actually got this from a neighbor when he was stationed in Germany so when it was making these just a you know a little bullet here split them in half and he made some inserts real real simple just some cotton a little screw that keeps your Flint a little wheel I think he actually purchased these a bunch of them and then just custom-made the shells so I thought that was kind of interesting let's see next one so obviously looks like a firecracker and that's just a little rubber string and actually turn upside down to light it that's how that works let's see next one real simple design nothing nothing fancy it's got a little key ring section on the bottom as a green flame there you go another one just you know unique design with a special regular flame seems like this has a lot of fluid in a left x1 is another one of those torches this one actually just says mega pocket torch haha these are actually quite popular they're you know sold all over the place push the buttons on the back here top actually flips up okay as you're pushing it and of course you'd have a jet flame but I don't have any fluid in this so unfortunately I can't show you there right now all right here's a little coca-cola lighter I hear the fluid not sparking though I've actually had flow over nine minutes I want to get to the end here eight have to make a play move I have no weight in here now so if I let go this is obviously falling so let me take that off the desk let me show you the last three one clip this is a Calibri an old one from the 70s no fluid left it's a little cheapo that supposed to be waterproof top opens up there's fluid but it's not sparking there's a little LEDs to blink in there the last one here is another Calibri this was called the touch back in the 80s and you would just basically just hold your finger there and it would light but it's broken something well the electronics are broken so they have it that's the rest of my collection thanks for tuning in hope you enjoy the rest of your day", "H7ErpSkLbbs": "[Music] 300 acres in alberta around a quarter million dollars the bic lighter around a dollar nine what do they have in common they're both worth every penny", "ddPJRcbedsI": "hey what's going on guys well I found it interesting later I want to do I share with you guys so basically we have a grill lighter right pretty convenient good for getting down there lightening the pilots on the grill or water heater or whatever getting down into like jar candles and stuff very convenient right we all know the grill later okay and of course everyone knows the big lighter also recommend but pocket sized so when you get when you cross the grill lighter with the big lighter you get this thing this is an interesting hybrid of both these these lighters I saw this at a Dollar Tree specifically it was on line by the register and unlike when you're standing there usually have candy and all kinds of crap like that well Daltrey has like decks of cards and rubber bands and all kinds of random stuff you know the impulse purchase aisle basically so I'll stay on the line and I saw these I had to get them because I saw a good you know benefit using it as a disposable type lighter okay usually I'm smoking a pipe and I don't want to break out an isolator I'll use a pic that's kind of pain up up with this with this little extension here very similar to the grill lighter but on a micro scale serves the same function where I can get down deep into a bowl and yeah so it's kind of a kind of a benefit they're very good for for pipe lighting but also good for other stuff like know maybe fireworks light infuses all kinds of things I mean use your imagination but it's just it's just interesting it is still pocket-sized it's not quite as convenient as this as a regular bic because a little bit bigger with that extension and but the big advantage is it is an electric lighter okay as opposed to a regular you know flint and wheel we have an electric spark what I don't like about it is there's no flame adjustment these are pre adjusted here's another one as I saw in green did a bunch of green ones and then way in the back they had an orange one and everyone was waiting for me it was like five people online when I was pulling all of them off the shelf to get to the orange one so you can show you both colors I really wish this came in like black and red which it probably does okay have to look it up online this is crocks brand now I saw that something like a lot like the shoe and I kind of laughed and but it is it's the same logo I believe as Crocs you know that whatever they are sandals flip-flops now they're not sandals they're black water shoes you know my red Crocs yeah say Bryn I know that they make a grill lighter right but now they make the Handy lighter which is a kind of a hybrid so yeah disadvantages no adjustment to a flame your flame I mean the flame is good I'm good with that sighs it's a little bigger than some people might want because it won't conserve fuel as much it's not super low it's not huge it's right in the middle somewhere kind of a medium flame it is not refillable these are truly disposable what I like about these lighters then they have electric lighters when you're all done there's no fluid you break them open and you get the part that's underneath the the button here and you can use that to shock people which is hilarious but yeah the Crocs handy lighter interesting very cool for disposable pipe later so yeah and I already testing this it's not it for like regular-sized candles like say a Yankee large jar candle it works great you can get in there and you don't need this massive lighter to you know reach all the way down it's just a little bit more convenient for that as well but uh yeah there you go just want to share that with you guys one dollar each from Dollar Tree sometimes I give make sure I get that right because sometimes I mix up the dollar store names because they're so friggin many of them I remember back in the day when I lived in Jersey and I was probably maybe 12 or 13 years old there was a dollar store that opened up down by money strip mall there's a shop right and a pharmacy and something else forgot a book store and on the end so they opened a dollar store and this is the first time in my entire life I ever heard of a dollar store like what is that you can only imagine right you go in there guess what everything is a dollar but the old school the og dollar stores everything really was a dollar and most things were like two $4 or four $4 and what it basically was was I you guys are familiar with oriental training the company oriental trading does like bulk items on just random cheap things like you get a lot of 500 rubber balls you know bouncy balls for like 10 bucks or whatever or like you know a thousand little plastic spider rings for Halloween just really random stuff mass-produced in China and the original dollar stores that I've seen were that stuff it was it was food first of all the food that was in dollar stores was all at a date it was all past it's due date you know it means to get like a date or a bottle that's you know a month past it's due date or like little snack bars that are like you know two or three for a dollar you know and it was it was totally probably not allowed to be honest I don't think you can technically sell food that specific expiration date but I don't know the legalities of that but that's what it was you went in there is literally like a Chinese shop in America and you get all this all this junk for really really cheap but as time went on they started coming out with other things then of course like places like Dollar Tree where everything truly is a dollar that's nice but then you have all the places you know that you know only a couple things in the store of dollar I call those dollar at a time stores not dollar stores they're tolerate a time store if anything they're convenience stores but sometimes it's a little um you know a little tricky because the titles make you think it's a dollar you know like Dollar General Dollar General yeah a dollar store you walk in there and you grab some little shelf and it's like three bucks you're like what the hell but anyway I'm not gonna get a random dollar stores you guys know the deal but these are cool I thought this is pretty pretty cool for a dollar so into the lighters and gadgets and all kinds of stuff and more specifically if you smoke pipe and you're the guy using the pic all the time this might be a little bit more convenient for you and it's just as cheap that's it just a little peek at the crop stand you liner I like them they're pretty cool so I hope you guys have a great day and I'll see you soon", "qiRsqbQ8RGA": "got another video review for you today this one's from a company by the name of dissom i've never heard of this company before until a few weeks ago i was scrolling on facebook and i seen uh that they had a new design on a lighter where you can uh hold it inverted and you know by putting your finger in that hole and then mashing the button there and it lights upside down or right side up whichever one you want so i got a couple of them to do a review on and you know to be honest with you uh it's a pretty cool lighter i'll just run through some of the the features that it says right here it says it has a patented circle grip a lifetime warranty refillable design it does take butane it's a patent pending ergonomic circle grip flame adjustment angled flame pour and low temperature candle flame and so i'm just going to toss this to the side and then i'm going to show you the box that it comes in pretty cool box so if you are giving this as a gift it does make a nice presentation whenever you go to give it to someone and then you know the the lighter in itself it just looks sharp um it has that that high-tech look to it you know it's a lot different than just your typical uh zippos and then you know you got your information down below your your uh guide and then a silica pack for moisture or whatever you know as you can see right here is uh your typical button that you'd mash to to light it and the way that you you hold it would be like this and so you just mash that down and you can see it gives off a nice uh candle flame and then uh you'll also notice that it's angled right in here and you know you that's pretty cool let's say you're you're smoking out of a pipe you can have it angled like that so it goes down into the pipe and i'll show you what i'm talking about but first you know if you were going to light it a pipe you would probably adjust your flame up make it a little bit higher and you can see but uh you know if you were gonna put it down into a pipe you know it gives you plenty of uh a flame to get it down in there plus when you when you suck on the pipe you know it's gonna draw that that flame in but you know it puts out a pretty good adjustable flame i'll go ahead and adjust it down to to low and then you can see i'm turning the wheel just slightly you know it goes goes pretty good ways i mean it puts out a a good flame now they say not to hold it down more than like 10 seconds you don't want to overheat or something like that again this thing is refillable it takes a butane and the way that you you fill it up is right here on the side there's a butane port what you want to do is let's say you're running low of butane uh you want to take and release all the back pressure out of the butane lighter so what you'll want to do is take you a just a regular old ink pen and you want to press in on that little port you'll feel that it's spring-loaded in there you'll just press in on that and it'll release whatever a little bit of butane and then your you'll be good to take some butane like i have here in a can you just take the nozzle put it right there in that little hole and press down on that port for like five seconds now let me back up before you fill that up with butane you want to take and lower the the size of the flame down to its smallest setting before you fill it up so just keep that in mind i got a little bit of a hit of myself but uh anyways after you fill it up just leave it for a little while and then and let it set and then when you come back to it it'll be good to go i actually just filled mine up and uh as soon as i filled it up i turned right around and i didn't even let it sit and i went ahead and used it and didn't have any problems out of it so anyways seems to work uh really well pretty uh reliable you know sometimes you'll have one or two little misfires and that's fine and most of the time it's happens because of myself because i'll leave it adjusted down too low or i'll have it adjusted too high too little adjustment it's not getting enough butane too high it's flooding the system so it you know gives it too much and puts it out so just kind of make sure you you have your adjustment wheel adjusted to uh like a medium cool thing about it is just being able to stick your finger in there and plus it's just got a cool high-tech look to it so you know if you're using this as an everyday care uh it's a really good lighter um hadn't had any problems out of it had it for a couple weeks i'll sit on the couch and just you know just tinker around with it and just sit there and light it and light it and light it and uh you know hadn't had any problems they say if you have any problems with it lighting it's usually low of butane or a little uh igniter in there it's not adjusted correctly and there's a video that you can pull up from the manufacturer of this on how to adjust it all literally all you do is just take a a a little screwdriver and and just bend the igniter down just a little bit because probably what's happening is the igniter is is uh actually touching the metal and instead of igniting the butane so it's no big deal but uh like i said i haven't had any problems out of it seems to work good so i'm going to show you another thing that i got with it i would definitely buy the pouch i really do like the pouch a lot just simply because the way that it's made and everything it's just really handy it's got a little area right in here where you could hook it to let's say a carabiner and hook it to your key chain or you could just hook it directly to your keychain that's not going to rip out right there very easily and it's got a nice strong material and then right in here you've got plenty enough room to take and slide your lighter into and just slide it in like that and then seal it up and the thing that i like about it is you can't see there's an opening right there that zipper just it closes up around it and so it's pretty much it looks to me like it would be watertight i mean because nothing could get in there once you zip it up the way that it folds in on itself so i really do like that a lot i really i really do wish they would make pouches like this for other stuff but i was like you know what this would be really cool let's say you got your lighter and you don't want to carry a wallet and let's say you you're going to a bar or something and you want to slide your your id in there you can put your id right in there like that and then let's say you want to carry a 50 or 100 with you and of course i'm you know keeping it real here i've got just a 10 but you could take and easily slide several bills down in there with with the lighter and your id and everything now it's going to be a little difficult to get shut if you have a bunch of bills in there but you see i didn't have any problems with that 110. you know if you kept that on your keys that's just really handy so i really do like the pouch i think i think it's awesome so anyways i like the way it looks like the color of it and it just really complements the lighter and plus you know it looks pretty swanky when you go to pull this thing out you've got a nice pouch for it and so anyways now i've got me a little cigar here and i'm no cigar aficionado like some of you guys out there but uh i do like to smoke one every now and then and considering the couple days ago it was my 41st birthday i figured what the hell i'm gonna go out and get me a nice little uh seaguar and uh get this baby going so this one here is not crazy expensive it's just a uh kuba kuba so oh it's an infused cigar so some of you might like those some of you might not just uh about what all what all you like so go ahead and get my flame going go ahead and get her toasted up around the edges so i can get a nice little burn going all the way around and what i like about it is uh gives you a nice handle flame so it don't produce too much of a hot spot so you can can just go around and so it's a nice even burn all right guys well appreciate you guys watching you know i'll put a link to the dishon website down below in the description you know if you're a jokester prankster like me and thinks stuff's funny and you like my shirt and you found it funny and you actually know what this is in reference to then check out the dudes threads they've got some hilarious t-shirts and uh you know i ended up getting probably four or five t-shirts from them and i told them that i would uh put a link in the description so you you could find their website please like and subscribe to the channel and don't forget to smash that notification button or the bell i'm sorry i'm getting old so anyways thanks a lot guys for watching have a good one", "uD_-KImURUw": "hey everybody it's Hawk LMT here and quite frankly I like lighters I tried the bow drill thing and it really doesn't work I haven't mastered that yet so in the meantime I carry a lighter this air is the big meanie and this is the standard bic these are my two favorite lighters I really like the BIC mini a lot because it's compact and it works really well but the one thing that I don't like about BIC is this little dude right here this little device this little safety device it's a little safety device that they have added to keep kids from activating a lighter now I prefer to do my own parenting plus when my fingers are cold that thing kind of hinders my ability to operate this lighter so what I do is I take a screwdriver and I just get rid of that safety device oh my gosh she's getting rid of a safety device these kids are gonna burn the house down no they're not because I do my own parenting anyway that's what I like to do in order to make these lighters work just a little bit better the other thing that it does is if it gets dunked for any reason it's easier to blow down in there and get this thing dried out and get it functioning again so a quick little tip on modifying a Bic lighter make it work a little bit better for you have a great day", "10ZzAOhOKn0": "hey guys it's James here with honest cigar reviews calm and I just want to do a quick video of some lighters as well as the fuel because I kind of had to learn the hard way when I came to lighters I had some I'm actually having lighter issues recently and that's why I'm doing the video and it's it's because I bought this really cheap I wanted a soft flame lighter so I bought this like a dollar local shop really it's it's like one of those gas station just really cheap ones so I urged it out you know both ends and I just filled it with some xikar fluid butane and so this has let's see here this was like 10 bucks 10:49 for this huge bottle you can see comparison to my hands in this smaller onsen one and it's 30 parts per million so if you can see that stuff is really clean and it's yeah keep your lighters working better longer won't leave like build-up residue inside the tubes and the pipes and stuff so yeah I basically I was having problems with this it was like this tiny little flame that was barely keeping lit and I kept adjusting all the all the adjustments and you know getting a q-tip and whatnot so I finally just purged it and filled it with good butane and so here's results give a huge flame it's like that's about a four three and a half inch flame and so that's just the that's that's what that's without adjusting I mean I got to get a guitar pick or something maybe maybe my house key and adjust it down but that just already shows me that butane was an issue not the lighter so it's getting smaller basically I grabbed a key because it's I mean it's always on me so this is its smallest setting that's perfect for me I think you know I was using this for like like lighting a pipe and stuff and cigars for indoor but already lowest setting is bigger than the highest setting with it with the bad butane and yeah so I mean I've been smoking cigars for like five years but I've been using Ronson the whole time and Ronson I mean apparently he's not very good stuff it's having sputtering issues with my xikar right now it just barely works I don't know if you didn't hear that oh god I don't know so I keep adjusting it we'll see where it goes and then I had this Ronson lighter that my old roommate gave me and this used to work great recently it's been sputtering a lot so we'll figure it out but let's see here you can hear it coming out I'm going to empty it out I'm going to empty this out you can hear that I want to empty them of the Ronson and fill them with the xikar and see if we get better results season alright so I think I just do this on camera because it's kind of interesting to watch I'm gonna use some scissors just to purge and yeah see hopefully this works here it's almost totally empty no more hissing is coming out this is a good time to check to see if the nozzle is nice and clean and see if I can get to focus here looks pretty clean to me okay and then we're going to get our xikar stuff this is the Pierrot fine premium good stuff and we're going to just tip it up sit down just like the directions say and hold it down for three to four seconds one two three four five okay doesn't normally could feel it give a little cold and sometimes you'll have two lighters I have a gauge mine doesn't so I'll just keep going and I guess the idea is to just keep going until you maybe it backs out a little bit see now it's starting to spit back out and you know I mean the butane comes out like freezing cold so you got to give it like you got to give it like four or five minutes for it to get down to room temperature and so what I do normally this time is just hold it my hand you know because if it's if it's too cold it just won't like simple as that so we'll put the top back on and we'll hold this in our hand and we'll see what happens see you soon all right guys we're back again and it hasn't even been like three minutes yet and let's just see what happened done normally I turn it down all the way you turn it down all the way fill it up and then when you realize it you kind of adjusted it as such okay a little bit more I see a flame coming out oh that looks about right to me nice steady flame this is up all the way it's pretty good all the way or a little less doesn't really matter to me I guess I'll just leave it up all the way but easy as that I mean I can already tell it's not going to sputter on me do that hundred percent of the time is working we're going to try the Ronson now this is going to be the real test because the rots and fuel sucks but does the Ronson lighters suck is it is it the fuel that's the problem or as a delight err so again we're going to just we're going to just test it real quick see if we can see that here a little bit of gas coming out let's see if what we can do here operating use a guitar pick here and just kind of sometimes it's just you got to turn it sometimes just to get the valve the valve opening close and get it cleaned it out so we had something going on this one might have like a leak or something you never know I mean this is not really my primary lighter here so I do like I like Ronson though I mean so far I mean it's worked great I mean here that nice solid open and closed nice solid click but if it's not lighting well then what's the point who cares so let's get this guitar picking here again I just mess around with it see if this scoop is if not well then we'll just purge it there we go make sure this is all the way to the not the big side but the small side so I just filled this up with Ronson hopefully I don't hear much more buzzing just get rid of all of it hopefully this it's not the lighter another great benefit is using a you know really triple refined stuff or you know five times refined or even this that says thirty parts to a million refined basically it's going to taste and you're not going to taste it in your cigar at all that's why we don't use big lighters because it's cheap fuel you're going to taste it has an odor to it but butane shouldn't so I think that's about it sometimes you just got to do it three or four times I don't hear anything I don't see any pops of Jack coming out and I'll cut you guys the moment of truth Ronson lighter feels pretty heavy I mean almost twice as heavy as what what it was but let's see if it if let's see if it's the gas that's going to fix it or if it's just the crappy lighter in general I mean again this is a cheap lighter so let's find out it's working look at that so I mean really guys all three of these lighters were having some sort of issue well some sort of problem but every single time the crappy fluid was the problem not the actual lighters so you can make a great dollar lighter dollar-store lighter you can make great darker lighter if you just have good fuel and don't skip out on it because i think i paid 6 bucks for this a couple years ago I still have some in there but when it comes down to it I mean when you need a light you need a light so yeah let's just to make sure this is not a fluke or anything this one's working great that one's working great and the Ronson is working great so the case is clear let's throw this stuff out and yeah you guys should get some xikar stuff definitely would recommend it and yeah have a good day gasps bye-bye", "w8yVE789D5k": "I've used bic lighters for decades they always work of course they don't work in the wind but they always work good product dependable if I need a lighter while I smoke cigars now if I need a lighter for my cigar this is what I get but now they got this stupid thing I know I'm gonna tell you this is stupid it's called a BIC multi-purpose lighter this is the worst damn product I've ever bought no this is right up there with I didn't buy it like the Keurig coffee maker during the hotel room this is right up there with the Keurig coffee maker this is a dumb thing you're supposed to hold this down which is difficult to do and then press this trigger by one find out it doesn't work they're going to get one light out of it then you get exhausted for pressing this trigger down it makes it difficult to operate this finger and then they got this stupid bend in the middle of it for what maybe it'll look cute this is worth less it doesn't work it's very difficult to operate and I guess this is this is childproof right I guess this is so a child can up well then why the hell don't you make

it's actually a pipe accessory it's a pipe later and as a lot of pipe smokers know one of the biggest problems you have when loading a pipe is you have to keep reloading a match again and again you don't want to use any kind of triple flame or anything with a real strong blue flame to it who's going to go ahead and damage your pipe so xikar has come up with it's been out for a while but it's new to me it's a scribed pipe lighter and this one is particularly the g2 they have another model which is kind of like a wood finish look as you can see there it's got like a attachment like a pen would have there's your clear window for fuel I've already bled it always bleed your lighters when you first get them and then your fill pointing your adjustment nozzles right there and as you can see it's not working right there and that's by design this way if it's in your popular forea button accidently going off the way you do is just snap it okay and then you're gonna be ready to go and then we're just one flick you're ready to go ahead and light your pipe and obvious I don't have a pipe here in front of me but you see it stays on and it's angle so that it'll go right down into your plate the flame will go down obviously when you're taking your puffs and then you're done you just snap it closed and that stops the flow of the fuel these retail for $44.99 are available at sicom they do have a lifetime warranty and something else the one point out is that a lot of pipe smokers may not know this is available or may not want to go ahead and spend the money on themselves this makes actually a great gift idea if you have a pipe smoker and your family you know something that they may not want to go ahead and spend the money on themselves but it really is amazing I've used three or four times so far and it's makes life so much easier slip it flick it and go ain't no to worry about matches burning your fingers or ruining your pipes so thanks for checking out stick review comm and check out xikar comm want to pick up one of these either in this design or in the wood design", "9nHmn0p4hoA": "it's up guys looking back bro smoke I stabbed my toe that's actually two different pumps well the same bun now I'm waiting on a bomb today we have a lighter well alright guys so this like these uh I got these in the mail today it was a pack of four four clipper letters one way so these are what's cool about these are that you can lint and actually use this as they like when you're trying to poke your joints that you don't got to go looking for something like we usually do you know the flame is cool now what's different about these lighters check this out is the Flint wheel it's a square where has like a star shape versus big letters and also it doesn't have a protection protector thing whatever like vixx usually do writing on the note but I take those off so they get more smooth m'kay live you are know about those these give a gas flames but yes and they suck like it's a pain to play right now it's like pretty good actually look like they're Flint wheel it's like for three different parts it's the wheel and then what this little grip thing on the side and then one other said that's already broken off so these letters are trashed [ __ ] that big flame you'll need that first time night and see it's like the shape of the wheel enables easy fast and also these are approached I'm pretty sure the Flint is also switch pretty sure you twist this up yep that's put the link of these in the description but you can find them on Amazon just playing clip roulette you'll find them the shape obviously makes it more comfortable interior the Flint things a plus use your trash so you can't go wrong with a click the lighter guys I say that's the Clippers lighters word for these kind of feel like you're sure I also have a Zippo lighter that doesn't have any more fluid but these are more like for outdoor smoking that really long ribs because it's hard with this plane it's a flimsy flame that just doesn't go off it's it goes out but what I noticed about the clipper ladies is that for example when you hit the bong when you know when you line your bull you kind of tilt the lighter the big lighter doesn't make the flame bigger when that happens but it you can hear the gas coming out a lot more what happens with this what the Clipper lighter is it lets out more gas but it makes the flame bigger he doesn't just let that gas escape watch that but this is just letting the gas escape without burning so that's [Music] when you use the one I like the least mostly I think I like this one the least [Music] this big stay tuned this binding like this big to this one you'll see why see peace subscribe if you like this video you put in time before your thumbs up and drop any comments questions below please smoker", "CJSvLB1dGhk": "so we all know flashlights and knives are important tools for survival of outdoor gear related YouTube channels these days but what about other outdoor gear so more people watch my channel I mean for your camping gear every day carry kit like fire take for example the new myth to Hill toe Hill I don't know lighter that going gear calm sent me for review it doesn't get more simple and rugged than this you're like oh is it one of those new lithium ion powered fire starters or a cool butane torch now come on man it's just a damn lighter it's about as simple and small as a lighter can get think Zippo design it uses Flint's wicks and fluids so you can buy it any gas station where you get your rolling papers like I don't know who you saw there man but that definitely wasn't me to Hill is designed for campers though and let me go over why because that's why you're paying me it's small and light so it's easy to throw in your pocket or bag its exterior is machined out of lightweight and rugged and it eyes the lumen 'm and it has a flat bottom so if you need to use it as candle while you find out where you put your damn flashlight but remember it will get hot it's still a lighter the letter also has a nice loop at the top for use with small carabiners or tie line or vines because you're that dude it's beefy so you don't have to worry about the metal breaking on that loop though the to Hill when not in use is completely sealed it screws together and has an o-ring to make it waterproof and keep your fluid from evaporating here let's leave it in some water for over an hour I'll turn on the time-lapse of my camera and then try to relight it and there's one dude out there saying an hour I only be impressed by a weak and I apologize if I don't have a lot of lighter jokes do you know any leave them in the comments ok so obviously it seals well provided you keep your o-ring in good shape replace it when it needs it and maybe a little bit of Lube occasionally you already knew that ok so let's break it apart quickly unscrew it take out the lighter insert by grabbing on the striker wheel then there's a slight click you'll see there's a tiny bump that allows the insert to stay inside the aluminum housing when it's not in use so it won't fallout or rattle around in there so get out your lighter fluid you know the same stuff used in Zippos I use Ronson all it's the first time I've ever said it out loud you'll basically fill it until the fibre stops absorbing fluid make sure you do this slowly and carefully and then wipe off any standing fluid with the rag please don't overfill it then you're done cool this little lighter is a perfect camping companion because of its sealed design it keeps your firestarter dry and ready even though the rain ruined your weekend of drinking in nature you can drink in the tent right the new myth tow Hill comes with a resealable vinyl package with instructions and two spare o-rings although that vinyl package I is not like airtight so you know maybe it's just like a backup line of defense anyway if you liked the video every day

even see you there you ever wonder how to refill a big lighter they make them so you can't but you again because you're capable capable human beings okay so other than dead lighters which nobody needs you need a thumbtack butane obviously rubber grommets you need rubber grommets that fit around the butane sometimes the tack just doesn't see all right all right now you got everything you need fix they are not refillable because there's a little plastic bead on the inside where the hole is so you're gonna push the pin in pop that in into the inside and you'll be able to hear it rattle in there then you know you're good to go pop the pushpin out of the hole a little bit of beauty no come out grab your butane remember the rubber grommets you're gonna need those create an airtight seal push your butane to fill the lighter just like you would a refillable lighter and then it gets tricky you got quick get your thumb over the hole hold it there I dropped like a little dab of hot glue on my tack to make sure we got a good seal and then you got to be ready and quick if I can get it in the hole it's gonna spray out a little bit but you can get it in there most of the time [Music] you see

new is a car Verano lighter just got this lighter in the mail a couple days ago and I know the Lightning out here is super crappy kids are asleep so I finally get the chance to smoke a cigar and I'm out here on the porch in the dark enjoying my cigar and watching some TV on the laptop while I do that but this is the xikar Verano it's a new lighter from xikar for 2018 I got the bronze finish and it feels good in the hand it's it's nice and sturdy there is a little bit of a rattle to it which took me a minute or two to get used to but that rattle is actually the ball bearing inside so when you fire it up now you fire it up just by pulling down on this knob here and it's actually a flat flame which is this is the first flat flame lighter I've had but if you can see right here there's a slit in the lighter and that's where the flame comes out with the premium butane it lights just about every time flawlessly the flame is smaller than a lot of the double or triple flame torches I use that you can raise it up I'll go ahead and set it to maximum in it so that's maximum so it's not the biggest flame but I actually really like it for lighting cigars because it's a milder flame it's kind of like a wind proof version of a soft flame so it lets me touch the foot of the cigar nicely without just scorching it and then I can light the cigar evenly pretty easily with that so here if we turn it on I turned it back down to like medium and even blowing on it it doesn't go out I've got some much larger torches that go out way easier than this one does and then if you turn it over like this if I've got it upside down the ball-bearing jiggles inside of it and you actually can't pull the ignition to start it if it's upside-down but as the ball-bearing goes back to the bottom of the lighter you can pull that ignition so it won't go off in your pocket if you've got it facing down which is nice keep you from setting your pants on fire which is always a plus let me turn this around real quick you guys can see just a size comparison here so this is the Verano next to the xikar xi2 cutter they're really just about the same size in height so if you have one of those xi2 cutters it's a pretty similar profile in your pocket just in terms of height there it's a hefty sturdy feeling lighter I like the bronze finish I like that you don't have a separate contraption to flip up to start it you just pull down on that ignition switch and it goes I like the flat lighter flame it's a bit softer the fuel consumptions been great on it so far I probably just turned it on and played with it for a good ten minutes before it actually ran out of fuel like keeping it on for 10 minutes so it does pretty well it's got that xikar fuel gauge at the back and it's see-through like right there as it's getting lower on fuel if I lift it up here and shake it just a little bit you can see it's red when it's all the way full so right now it looks like it's about half full or so but it's red when it's full and then it's see-through when it's getting close to empty so that makes it nice and easy to use well let's go ahead and light a cigar and go from there so my apologies again for the really crappy lighting but on the plus side it'll make it easier to see the flame from the cigar because it's pretty difficult to see sometimes in daylight turn that up a little bit so I've got a black market Esteli here we'll go ahead and toast the foot of the cigar just ice and gentle that makes it really easy just to warm it up get it toasty without totally igniting it yeah so see very little ignition awesome and then when you light it the nice thing is it does have this super shiny chrome plating on the top of the lighter so I found when I go to light it like this it makes it easier to see how much of the cigars lit so there we go all set if you're looking for a new lighter I really like this one so far again this is the xikar verano new for 2018 a great little lighter if you can get your hands on one I was only able to find one on Neptune cigars I think they're supposed to be available from several other retailers pretty quick but that's where I got mine so hope you enjoy have a great weekend", "RHnPj6Z6n5I": "fire is often cited as one of the most important discoveries humans have ever made and because nobody likes to constantly start a bonfire in order to light their cigarette we needed a way to make it more portable of course this is where the lighter comes into play the forerunner to the modern day lighter was the flintlock pistol in fact interestingly enough by definition a flintlock pistol can be classified as a lighter and I wouldn't recommend trying to light cigarette with one the method of flintlock pistol used to light its gunpowder by taking a piece of Flint usually stored in the hammer of the pistol and striking it against a piece of steel in order to create a spark would we extend it upon to create the first commercially successful lighter the reason I say the first commercially successful lighter is because the first lighter did not use flint and steel to create fire instead it used a chemical reaction between platinum and hydrogen to create heat this was called Doppler Amer's lamp named after the inventor Johann Wolfgang diamond however da primers lamp saw very little commercial success as the platinum catalyst was expensive which made it more of a luxury item there was also this little thing about the hydrogen being highly explosive but that's all in the details in 1903 barium was patented by Karl Englund von Frisch Beck barium is essentially a special kind of flint it allow the modern-day lighter to be possible however these lighters are still not what you and I would consider a modern-day lighter for one they required a wick what you would have to change occasionally they also didn't use butane instead they used Napa which is more of an oily substance that could be whipped up these lighters will certainly cheaper and safer than platinum lighters we're still more of a luxury item according to Zippo and 1933 you could expect to pay a dollar 95 for a lighter adjusted for inflation this brings the cost up to approximately $36 and this is cheap before Zippo prices were much higher while the everyday blue-collar worker could afford this it just wasn't that common about the same equivalence as buying expensive fountain pen today and unless you're an enthusiast the cheaper option will work just fine and this is what happened with lighters every day smokers opted to the much cheaper match in the 1940s the next big step came to lighters Napa was replaced with butane this meant that there was no longer a wick that had to be also since butane is compressible manufacturers can now control the fun intensity after this we didn't see any significant changes with lighters until big introduced their disposable lighter in 1973 at this point lighters were no longer status symbol they were cheap in disposable and this is the lighter that we have today while you can buy better lighters like Zippos for example majority of people prefer the cheap and expensive option because it gets the job done and it works just fine well guys that does it for our brief history on the everyday lighter I hope you enjoy the video and if not don't be afraid to tell us what you didn't like if you did like it however check out our last video on a brief history of the computer mouse and there will be more to come and as always please enjoy the rest of your internet and going experience", "I1L0VR5k0GA": "[Music] hey [Music] foreign", "dC3VJGFpdGs": "today i'm going to show you how to make a customized brick lighter pick a picture you want upload it i use cricut design space to customize it you're going to print the image not cut it once you have your image on your design space you're going to duplicate it then put them side by side as even as you can group it attach it change the size to 2.5 by 2.65 make it it fits six lighters on here this is what i use to print the images cut the image and get ready to put it on the lighter and here it is this one came out perfect then you're going to spray with some of this there you have it your customized big lighter", "-3P7wDbZA74": "Hale done well on the show today is which I only got a little bit here is a bit lighter hack so your beat kids run out of fluid you've got some char cloth or charred Punk or you just frayed up some cotton or something like that most show you can take stuff out of your kit just like a needle or pliers or anything like that and without taking the beat apart you can take this child safety proof office is just something that yeah I wanted to show I don't know you know some people may know this some may not but you know you risk and taking this apart losing that spring so and the way to do this is make sure I'm up here close you take I'm trying to look through the screen and do this at the same time you'll take and depress that little deal can you see that okay you can see that get something underneath there and you'll Bend those tabs up now see that just popped free all right now you'll take and put your needle underneath there and take a little prying in a little wiggling just like that whoop there she went it'll pry right out a little problem I do this to all my big lighters and stuff - well then every letter is lucky I found this one and then all you have to do is depress those little tabs back down lighters good to go and then once you're done with that if you need to get into the lighter which most people knows how to do that to strike some stuff you're just going to pull this guard here off which other paint get it right now but there you go and then you can strike and get whatever you need going but she works perfect now but say she was out of fluid and just doing this number here well she's going to light up when you take this guard off you can get your char cloth or whatever closer to it but like say I would not just leave that on that way you don't risk this coming apart losing your spring inside and your piece of Pharisee them go flying out and then it just be totally inoperable but there you go guys just a little quick video to show you that for those that may not have known catch you next time", "XYngswO9Gp4": "okay as promised I told you that I'm going to show you how to turn this into something really cool and you will need a bit lighter and a clamp like this I bought this down at Home Depot for a dollar so first thing we're going to do is get rid of all the unnecessary parts here we've got to get rid of this windscreen so we'll pop it off throw it away we're going to need to take this roller out here be careful because underneath here is a spring where your Flint is and so you've got to be very careful in taking that out so that it doesn't fly all over the place okay I've got that loose from that side then that back just jab and just like that your Flint went flying then all this stuff down here comes out this is not needed just extra weight okay and that's what you're going to end up with fortunately it didn't fly too far there's my Flint you're going to need this bottom part you're going to need that spring put that spring back in in there we're going to put that Flint back on top and then a wheel on top of that I'll show you what that looks like when I get it put together okay there we go we've got that put together by the way you want this empty the next thing we want to do is get this bottom the easiest way to do that is just cut this off so let me grab a tool and get that cut off for you real quick okay that's what we've got so far what we're going to do so we're going to take some cotton balls and put a little Vaseline on them and then we're going to take and pack this end with cotton balls now we're going to take this clamp and take the ends off of this clamp need two ends right like that well take off of those clamps now those ends will fit one over this end will fit on there like that the other end you put over your Flint this will go over there like that and now what you have is water proof you have an ignition source and your tender very small package bic lighter will cost you less than $2 and the clamp was $1 there's a three dollar fire kit right there very easy very simple okay next time I'm going to show you how to make a stove using three cans", "Tdyw93Em5fE": "well for all those people who like the watch later the electric watch later there's a different watch later this one has a butane flame so it's an actual flame and that's pretty badass actually I had a viewer send this to me because he sells these on his Etsy page and the person's name is a really long shop name I think they'd go buy the same on YouTube so basically he sent this with a short letter that says you know he doesn't make these he just buys and resells them on his Etsy page but he wanted to know if I could show you guys it obviously because there's tons of interest in the electric one so yeah I'm gonna do a quick review on this I've had this for a few days now able to use it enough to give you guys a review here's the box that comes in JH watch lighter alright these are made overseas you see Jane H on the back it's just his watch lighter in a circle now the first thing is obviously the novelty factor here is extremely cool okay you have a side button okay which is going to turn on your lighter alright you're refilling port is right here it does work fine you can adjust this I did adjust the flame up and down when add the box the flame is pretty small to conserve fuel I did want to raise it up a little bit okay now as you saw there do not light on the first shot it is not always light on the first shot okay and there's plenty of fuel in here I did refill it so it's a little consistent the clock on here the watch part does work and it has an independent battery unlike a lot of people like questions about the electric lighter hey you know and the the lighter part doesn't work does that mean that the actual time stops and yes I believe it does I believe it runs off the same exact battery now I have my brother-in-law testing it I'm giving it to him as a gift and he's using the heck out of it to see how many lights he can get off of it and stuff and I'll report back in a future video with an update on that lighter and what he found but this one having an independent battery separate from the the lighter portion of it is nice because even if you run out of fuel in this particular case your watch always works now the watch does have the right time you can see that three different dials there they're just mock dials they're just for looks for you know a chronographic type of look it's not functional whatsoever it's just a very simple watch okay it does keep the right time which is nice we're looking through our time forever probably not this is a very cheap you know Chinese made novelty thing this is basically just a the same the same quality as the lighter you to get at the gas station okay for five or six bucks or whatever the only difference is it has some watch straps and it has a watch movement in it okay now the straps are horrible these are the worst watch straps I've ever seen in my entire life it is a very very cheap plastic e rubber they they smell horrible they it's nauseating how bad the the watch band smell and I can almost guarantee that if I were to rip this or if it gets a little cracking it that it would actually rip like a piece of paper that it would tear right across also they're kind of stretchy it I don't know it just it feels like really really old stick of gum if that makes any sense to you it does work obviously it you know if it's around the wrist just fine I did wear around for a couple days it's just the watch bands are horrific the good news is however you can take them off or replace them as a standard you know connection that regular pin that goes across whatever you sink and pop it out and you could buy more permanent bands for this which I would highly recommend if this is something you're to buy to use please do get a normal you know either leather band or another plastic band or whatever you don't have to get something expensive but this thing is just not the last I can tell that just from from wearing it even though it's held on for three or four days now I don't think it's gonna hold on for the long run so the watch part works the lighter is very very cool I really don't know what I prefer more I kind of like I kind of like the the butane went a little bit more it is even fatter the first watch was kind of chunky but this one looks to be even fatter the adjustment for the watch part is right here just like a normal watch overall you know hey you know if you want this type of thing that's what you got right there that you know there's no real high end watch later that I know of you know will people pay $100 or more for a very high quality watch that's also wider probably but I don't think they're sold anywhere I just never been exposed to them I have been exposed to lots of cheap gimmicky stuff and this is definitely a gimmicky item but it's still friggin cool and I still know there's lots of people out there who would want something like this um he sells it for 20 bucks on his page and I'll put a link down below because he sent these that's why I'm leaking you guys to him I know for a fact there's other places you can get these but you know courtesy of him you know sending this I thought was very nice and to expose you guys to this that's what I'm providing you with is the link to his page just it's an interesting watch I probably won't work forever the same as the the lighters you get from the gas station and stuff those novelty lighters now so this is just a novelty lighter they're very cool sometimes they'll break the same day you get it sometimes you'll have it for a couple of years it's really hit and miss the quality is never ever consistent on stuff like this you know right now though it works fine like I said doesn't always light on the first click I am getting gas every single time it's just that spark it's kind of weak in there so it doesn't always light on me but um you know certainly an interesting piece then one thing I will tell you though is when it's on it's a little awkward to light because you have to pull down on this alright because I wear my watch on my left hand I'd much prefer this button slash lever or whatever you want to say on this side because it would be easier to pull on this side but you know if you happen to wear it on your right side of your wrist you'll be a heck of a lot easier to use I found it to be a little awkward but I have to end up doing it's just holding this part here and using my thumb to come down and light it alright it's just a little awkward of an angle that's all but yeah there you go that's the aah Chinese watch later I really appreciate him sending them you know so I can show you guys it and you know it is a novelty thing but just don't expect a whole lot out of it put it that way something is very cool its novelty will eventually wear off but for the people who will actually use this the smokers and stuff they're always losing their lighters this is a good option highly highly recommend going to Walmart or something and getting yourself a five dollar watch band to add to this because the band that comes with it is just junk and there is no way it's gonna last any length of time so that's all you guys enjoyed it if you do have this watch already and you've had it for a long time write in the comments down below you know what you what you think of it it's a still work after months on end or years they're just curious to see I will continue to wear this on and off along with the other watches they have I actually have another watch that be needy seeing a regular watch it's not a lighter watch or anything but I will do a video with that in the future because it's pretty cool it's kind of a g-shock ripoff but uh anyway just wanted to I'll show this for you and see if anyone's interested in that you can check out his Etsy store for them so thanks for watching hope you guys have an awesome day and I'll see you soon take care", "bkK_ynVhi_M": "what up alright so this video will be about how to take the safety off of a lighter and the reason why people take the safety off of like the little safety metal part off of lighters is because it makes it a lot easier to like do this so um I'm just gonna go ahead and people try to peel the label off of this to like make it look cuter or whatever there we go alright so here's a lighter I just bought this yesterday and if you don't know what this safety on a lighter is it is this metal part right here that see my knife is under it right now it's this thing right here and the reason for it is because you know it makes it a little harder as I said to make like light the lighter and it's just a safety precaution so like little kids can't start house fires as easily however I don't have any kids so I have no reason for this safety I want to be able to light easier cuz the way I like to light lighters is like this with my pointer finger but I can't do that when the safety is on it cuz I like yeah so the way I take the safety off of a lighter is I get a little knife like this or just something something strong something to will be able to dig up and like pry this off so you have to find something that you can like dig into this and pry it off so basically I do this and I get the thing underneath the safety like this I don't know sorry it's not focusing and then you just kind of try to wiggle it off up there see it's starting to come up and it usually goes flying like that we see if I can find it [Music] yep that thing's gone I don't know where it went but now the safety is off and this is what it looks like now see that little um the thing is gone yeah so it looks like this now and now it's very easy to light and I can do this now so now whoo I can do that so that's how you take the safety off of a lighter and it's much easier to hide it there you go have a good day bye guys see you later", "AfOeSHuI-hg": "hello youtubers today I want to make our river view between two different lighters this is the common bit lighter with flint and steel it was is big and this is a new version of a bit of bit like of it later okay it was all it was also well when I come what I'm going to do now is to put them in the water and what happens when I try tonight this doesn't work the traditional big doesn't work wait we must a wait it dries doesn't work but this this one even wet it did nights again can you see okay this was what I wanted to show you that's all friends oh I see you", "cNMPThhYeVc": "good afternoon YouTube my name is Brandon airing and once again this is cigar crush I'd like to welcome you to my channel today and I'd like to talk to you about one specific thing this is considered the devil of the cigar world oh no don't look at it it's too scary well it's not there's nothing wrong with this lighter at all this lighter right here is considered your BIC cigarette lighter this is cigarette lighter throw away lighter cheap-ass lighter or whatever you want to say it is a perfectly good lighter and it is a butane lighter that's right it is not a lighter made with lighter fluid like Zippo fluid no it is butane right here I don't want anybody to tell me in comments that it's made with xikar purifying butane because I very highly doubt that but I'm using this as a reference to butane so only referencing butane nothing else don't look at that but it's butane so this right here is a bit lighter it runs off the butane gas there are no impurities there are no bad flavours that it could impart to your survivor if you end up lighting your cigar with this lighter right here is perfectly fine just as if you went over and you lit your cigar with this right here we will get into this lighter another day or in another video it could be five minutes from now but you'll never know this lighter right here is a butane lighter when they fill it up and then put the gas into the chamber in here you can shake it and you can hear it and that's one characteristic of lighter fluid and that's gives it away for people is that you shake it and you can hear it and you can feel out moving around in there and you wonder will this is lighter fluid obviously well when butane gas goes into an airtight chamber such as this it becomes an a gap excuse me in a liquid form it's later inside this sorry liquid inside this tank here and when it goes into the smaller tank it still stays into a liquid but as soon as you light it and it is brought out to the oxygen and turns into a gas state there is no aftertaste there is no bad odor there is barely any odor of any kind that comes out of this lighter once it's been lit or even if you open the gas chamber and you smell it which I don't recommend doing but I have done it for the sake of this video to smell it you can barely small thing unlike Zippo lighter fluid made with kerosene excuse me kerosene that has a very bad odor not bad some people might like if it's a very stronger the purpose of this video is to debunk the conspiracy that bic lighters are made with lighter fluid and you should never like their cigar with one of these now I'm not going to tell you to walk into a cigar bar or a BNN and walk in and the very first thing you do is pull out a patron or a saint crystal ball or a lot of woman to Cuba and just as soon as you pull it out boom get out your big ladder and I I I don't think I would do that myself because I have my personal butane lighters but if I'm at home I'm somewhere by myself and I forgot my lighter and I have a nice cigar with me and say I would love enjoy it I have a cutter that I don't have a lighter I will go and pick this can you spend a dollar for one with these and use this on my cigar no I'm not saying you can't use this at a bnm or at a cigar lounge but people may question you they may ask you to make it look at you funny and if you don't want to spend the time like I'm doing right now to explain to them it's butane it's okay relax mind your own damn business then help yourself a butane cigar lighter but if not and you don't care about anybody saying anything [ __ ] it use one of these and you be proud of using it but my point for this video is that this is butane gas butane and not agri-food wood so ladies and gentlemen if you don't believe me I very strongly recommend you going on to Google I always know that Wikipedia is the best form of answers no but you can go on to bits website or you can go on to many other websites or if you want to you can pry this open and you can pour it out and see all of nothing because it will turn into a gas form as soon as you open it I do not recommend doing that there are warnings on the back stating that it is flammable under pressure and romantical contains flammable gas under pressure there we go I just assumed that but I didn't actually read it never expose heat above 120 degrees Fahrenheit or to prolonged sunlight never puncture or put in fire okay these sure flame is completely out after each use I think it's out do not keep lit for more than 30 seconds there's another big thing they will talk about that in this video if you're a person like me who likes to post you're sick i toast my cigar and get all of the quarters and the edges and someday I'll do a video about that about me like my cigar nice and lit and it's nice and starting to turn white and it's got a nice little ass just around the circumference of it and it's nice and it's my free light and then I go up and I take too long drawers while lighting it and those two drawers get the rest of the diameter of the cigars lit and everything's good to go and it's all lit evenly it may take more than 30 seconds to light with one of these if you want to follow this warning 30-second stop let it sit for a little bit do 30 seconds more I don't think that's gonna blow up on you but if it does do not come back on me ladies and gentlemen this has been Brandon airing with cigar crush with this little guy right here the bic lighter I'm gonna look at it oh wait you can because it's a butane lighter you can hike cigars with this butane butane double thumbs up Brandon airing cigar crush I will see you in the next video", "CXOI4d0cdk8": "hey guys Joe here today we're going to be testing out these lighters one more video before the end of the year I'm in the garage right now because it's really windy out and cold so I wanted to just brace the video from the wind what we're doing with these milliliters is we're gonna test how they handle the winter conditions I've already made videos about why I think bic lighters are better than farads but I think it's time to revisit it the topic again just because it's winter and a lot of people point out winter is the weakest point about carrying a Bic lighter if you don't know these Brenham butane and in the cold butane will not evaporate as readily which makes them harder to light but as you can see here both of these lighters are in working condition and let's see if I can do it with them any one it's difficult one-handed to handle both of these there we go so they are both working lighters this is a normal large big lighter this is a mini bic weight duct tape around it I want to test both because some of us especially in the outdoors survival bushcraft community do duct tape around our lighters that does play a role in how quickly this will warm up and I'll talk about warming them up later but because it's insulated by the duct tape it does make it harder to heat up and because butane doesn't handle well in the cold a lot of people say these are useless in winter I wholly disagree and I'm gonna show you why we're not just gonna test how they handle walking around in the cold air and stuff like that we're gonna test how they work being left out in the cold for a half an hour and we're also going to test how they handle getting dunked into water so we're going to go over that first test which is walking around this is going to go in the fire kit the fire kit is my Altoids tin here the electric tape is just to waterproof it around the edge maybe we'll do a video on it and that's gonna go in my fanny pack which I've got right here to simulate kind of being in a bag backpack messenger bag have a sec what do we call it but my jacket will be over it just to keep me warm so keep that into my effect this is in a bag but it's also under my jacket I'm not sure how that'll handle the results but the big bic is going to be going in my pocket as most of us would be carrying this whether it's your Farrah rod your your lighter your matches usually in a serious cold situation you're gonna want to keep these in your pockets so no matter what unless you lose your pants you're gonna have fire so this won't be going into my pocket and the common way to debunk all the claims of people saying these are bad and winter just carry in a pocket it will keep it warm enough and I'll show that and if it doesn't I'll show you how to warm these up second test like I said we're gonna leave outside for half an hour and then third test is going to be dunking these in ice water to simulate if you fell into ice water while you're out I think that was kind of a silly argument a lot of people made against big lighters well what if you fall into ice water you've got bigger problems but we'll talk about that if you're falling into ice water let's go for a walk let's put these layers away and I'll time it how long it takes to get out there right now it's around 12 degrees according to the weather station just down the road so is pretty chilly and I'm not sure what the windchill is with the winter wind speeds are up around 13 15 miles per hour right now for those that do metric in Celsius and all that I'll put the Celsius and the wind speeds and kilometers over here so before I drop these let's get going guys all right guys we've been out here in the 11 12 degree weather let me pull up my phone and see where we're at timewise we've sorry the camera there see if we can focus on it it's been around 21 and a half minutes I'll just call it 21 minutes we've been out here and it's been in my pocket the main bic lighter so let me pull it out it's been in my watch pocket does it still light yep it's a little windy but it will still like if you keep lighters in your pocket they will light even in these cold temperatures I'm not quite sure how cold this can go down to but as long as it's next to your body the lighter will usually remain the the correct temperature here let me pull out my fire kit my Altoids fire kit let me find where I had this this is freezing cold that like this feels very cold in my hand just a quick glimpse at the kit some lighters a candle all that other garbage and I'll explain why it's in there maybe when I make the video but how is this fair and how is this looking feels cold so I'm getting kind of a flame there there's a little bit of wind but you can tell from the size of the flame that is being affected by the cold there we go I got a steady flame there you can see that but because it's cold that that butane isn't evaporating as quickly to come out of here and it's making it harder to light but it will still light as long as I get in the right position with the wind so how do we fix this when these are cold easy you can just hold on to them you can tuck them in your glove tuck them in your sleeve tuck them in your pocket pretty much anywhere that is in body heat and it will warm up and I'm going to show you that in the next test that involves leaving them out in the snow for half an hour to let them get truly cold in these temperatures and we're gonna warm them up just with our bare hand and see how long it takes so let's get on to it alright guys we're back home both pleased leaders work I've been out here for about an hour so I'm gonna stand him up over there this works we're going to stand it up next to it we're going to leave these out here for half an hour in the same spot untouched and see how it handles being cold starting now [Applause] pardon in the car I live right next to a road or at least I used to this is my old house so we're gonna leave them there for half an hour and see if they still light and if not how we can warm them up again it is a very chilly day out here around 12 degrees maybe a little bit less know that I've been out here for an hour I think our high was only supposed to be around 1112 so it's probably a little bit colder now all right guys in about a half hour now heart out guys for any wind it starting to pick up getting a little bit colder it's down to 11 degrees in drought much now these theoretically should not work they are freezing cold so we got a spark but no flame let me turn away just to prove that's not the wind well actually so it's trying to get a flame there but the beauty is still just too cold so you can keep just trying to light it like this in a will warm it up as you can see there but every time the flames coming up it's going away quickly it's because the butane is still not warm enough to evaporate readily so you're getting a little bit of flame from the the puff of butane but it's not able to maintain it so how we can warm it up but we can just hold it in our bare hand for a little bit I'm actually surprised it was even starting to light as always apologize for the cars [Music] I'm not going to edit this out there we go out here for half an hour 11 12 degrees that lights just fine problem is gonna be this guy [Applause] so same situation it's sparking but there's the butane is just too cold to maintain a flame I'm not sure I can even get a little flame so we're gonna do that same thing with holding it he had another car speeding might I add this is one problem I hate about living in London where I used to we're right across the road but it's slightly off the main track so people go 2030 miles an hour over I've actually been clipped by the sideview mirror of a car before while walking cuz they didn't bother getting out of the way brushed right by my jacket had I been a couple inches over or lost my arm that's the main difference that duct tape makes a huge problem trying to warm it up not a huge problem I guess say it just it takes longer [Applause] hands actually setting to get cold here there we go so you saw it took a little bit longer than the big Bick but they will light pretty quickly just that hands warmth obviously in the real winter condition you're going to put these under your gloves under your armpit under your clothes but even just barehanded I was able to warm them up both enough to light I don't know this one was still light since I just sit on the ground yeah there we go so part one we walked around they got pocket heat right here we had it in a bag right here they were both able to like you just left these out here for a half an hour and just the quick heat of my hand warm this one up enough to light and took a little bit but this one warmed up enough alight so it is possible to use these in cold weather if you keep them in your pocket or even if you drop them and lose them and have to come back and find them you can still heat them up really fast they still work and part three here with some moving magic we're gonna jump back to the pasture and I'm gonna show you how these work after getting submerged in cold water for about 10 seconds or so a quick fall in the ice scenario if you were in the water longer than that say it took you a couple Minsk out of the water you've got a lot bigger problems than trying to light a lighter alright guys through the magic of video editing you will have just seen how to warm these up after they've been left in the cold for half an hour and how easy it is to warm these up by hand the whole idea that these are bad in winter just doesn't live up to my standards a lot of their claims when I literally just proved you can easily warm them up and before that I showed that if you keep in your pocket it's no issue now what happens if you fall in the cold water that's the biggest argument against the whole if you put it in your pocket you'll be fine will be fall into the water your pockets can be ice-cold there's a couple problems with that if you fall into cold water you're gonna have a couple issues right here this is a shallow spot for safety just in case I fall in but if you were in deep water deep ice water you've got a lot bigger problems if you follow in then whether you can light a fire or not because you might not make it out alive if you don't know what you're doing you can get trapped in the ice very quick onset of shock and hypothermia cramping things of that nature whether you can like this or a ferret or anything is really no matter what it your method is you're not gonna be able to light it if you're you're struggling to get out of ice water another problem with the ice water debacle is that shock and hypothermia no matter what you're carrying you're gonna have trouble once you get on land to light it a lighter you can just do one quick motion with one hand and it will light and I've kept these in the same this has been in that fire kit in my fanny pack and the other lighters still been in my pocket walking around here a little bit after I stopped filming they do like just show you that you're going to be suffering from shock and hypothermia something like this is a lot easier to handle one-handed one quick motion if you're shaking I can still later whereas if you were using a fair ride you got to use both hands and those are tricky to use in the first place unless you get one of those big honking ones but again we're comparing it to cheap lighters not expensive fair odds we want to do a fair comparison to price and this is what a lot of people carry for lighters these mini Bix and large Bix and those smaller fire steels so I just want to compare these lighters in price and this is how you can handle the cold weather so that in mind if you're going in shotgun hypothermia this is easier well let's don't get in water and just show that it is frozen hopefully don't knock over the camera oh I just broke through it there see me moving that ice with my foot so for my battery dies here do the cold let's simulate this dropping into the water 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 what light of course not now there's certain things you can do is getting pretty cold here but you can run it on your gloves to try to dry it out well it's Park No so I'm starting to get sparked there the whole point of this is to show you guys how this would work in a real situation hopefully I don't tear up my gloves doing this I guess it's clean enough to use on my jeans but you can rub them off your jeans off any clothing you have this won't the friction will warm them up but what I'm trying to do is actually dry out where the Flint is oh it's shooting sparks there so let's see oh there we go well I had it for a second oh okay there you guys go just on there on camera I showed you how to relight it if you fell into the water I dunked it in there for 10 seconds I'm still able to get it to go the same situation will hold true with the big bit out of my pocket the same situation will hold true with this the winds picking up here so it's a little hard there you got some flame there I'm going to do it again and if it doesn't make it on camera cause of the battery I'll just cut this part out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 obviously have your fallen into the ice water and it's very very seduce situation the kind of situation we're going to go into shock you're going to be in there for more in 10 seconds but strike it warming up off my gloves again this is not trying to light the lighter to get like get it warm with friction but it will do that but this is just to dry off that Flint I'm getting sparks once you start seeing sparks it's usually a good sign that you're doing it correctly you see that you might be Oh see on camera but it's really starting to spark because the sparks are holding each other and there we go I got a flame after it falling in water I think it speaks for itself guys and I've shown in previous videos if you get a Ferro rod wet at least depending on the Freret my Ferro rod it does not work immediately after getting out or even after wiping off a few times it really did take me a couple seconds to dry off and this really doesn't take that much longer to rub it on your pants and this will work even if your pants are wet I'm not gonna get my pants wet just cuz I walk home and freezing out but just take my word on it if you want to see true evidence of that there's other videos out there I will link of them in the description below if you want to see a guy drying these off with a wet shirt and being able to light it but there you go guys you've seen the proof walking out here in my pocket in a kit still work you've seen the proof of what if you leave it outside what if you drop it and have to come back and get it while I left it out for half an hour I was able to warm them up in my hands no problem I dumped it in the water here I was able to relight them no problem Vic lighters are awesome clipper lighters are even better because you can refill them and get new Flint's for them but I did the Bix for this testers because most guys know the Bix if you can get clippers they're like a Bick but even better so until next time guys next year stay safe stay informed get yourself a Bick try it out for yourself a bit versus your Ferro rod and remember to keep price in mind for the price of a large thick fair rod you can get a ton of these lighters and go on from there I'm not going to talk about Zippos just because I think there's a lot of weaknesses as oppose a butane lighter is a much better way to go and enclosed butane lighter whether it's refillable or not so every data is my hands freaking cold I'm going back home", "V44Y7zqvEV4": "what is up Turtles Creek here with black outdoors and today we're going to start another exposure test so the Bic lighter exposure test was really popular on our channel and it went really well so if you haven't seen that go check out that playlist there'll be a link in description to the videos but we're going to start another exposure test with a different brand of later what we have here is a brand new clipper lighter you don't find them around the states as much as a Bic but they're pretty popular in certain circles because there's a moving part I don't know if this will affect how well this will handle being exposed to the elements I do have a Bick and we'll take it we'll look at a comparison between the two so we have a Bick right here and we look at the top of it it's definitely more covered simply enough then where the gas is coming out of the Clipper but the reason we're doing the Clipper again because they are popular lighters around the same price the nice thing about the Clippers as well is that they are refillable the Bix are not again so I don't know if that will affect maybe how well it's going to last or gases escaping faster I don't know we'll see and it does work and it's full this probably won't get any sunlight direct sunlight where it's sitting actually forgot I wanted to write the date on the sticker just for just for kicks and giggles you got a marker on me yeah what's the day today Nate 7:30 that legible cool Oh Morgan come on Papa rub a mountain camp right now so the lighter is going to stay up here hopefully no one will take this the bic lighter disappeared towards the end of its testing well why the testing stopped because it disappeared I don't know who or what took it the big lighter exposure test wasn't super scientific on our part because we went out at random intervals of time and tested it so I want to ask you what we should do from here on out should we check it once every six months and let rust have a chance to build up should we come out once a month leave a comment let us know what do you think as always like to thank you for watching your constant support means a lot to my brother and I and our patrons as well thank you til next video this is Creek with black out peace out Turtles", "gp71_JyyxQ0": "sup white EPC this is DSG pipe smoker with another price like video today got my civil report some nightcap in it and I thought I would talk about or rather do a comparison of two most popular methods of lighting your tobacco in your tobacco pipe matches versus a Bic lighter now some people say that if you're a pipe smoker you're a real pipe smoker that is you pretty much have to use matches everybody uses matches back in the old days everybody was using matches matches burn cooler and that certainly is true did you consider the fact that primarily what you are using to keep the flame lit is a soft I think it's a cedar it's a soft wood and as long as you when you light it if you let that sulfur burn you let it burn up and then let the cedar burn you'll produce a cleaner smoke which is all true I have noticed that matches do burn cooler they produce a better taste right off the bat you can also vary the flame so and I just broke that that's one disadvantage of using matches so we let the sulfur burn and if I just tilt it like that see I can change the length of the flame but usually the flame will start out just ever so slightly bigger than the sulfur tip but you can vary the flame so it doesn't matter if you're using a dr. Grabow with say six tenths of an inch wide ball or a 320 with a bowl that's almost an inch I'm not a bowl but a chamber that's almost an inch wide you can make matches work but matches have their downfall have their downfalls I should say they have multiple cons to them one of them that really annoys me is they tend to produce waste even if you let the matches burn up all the way or most of the way they will produce like an ash or charcoal that can easily break off you know and they crumble they smear they just get everywhere it's no fun the other thing that's bad about matches is they're very picky about the conditions that you are lighting them in you cannot light it in conditions where there's any breeze whatsoever otherwise the matches will go out and yes this is talking about your average kitchen matches which you're gonna use matches that's what's recommended because it's the most natural it's the most clean burning yes they do make wind resistant and waterproof ones but those are usually coated with a material that prevents the matches from going out under said conditions so matches are generally used at your local B and M or in your house if you can smoke there they were used quite often back in the day because you know they were next to nothing and everybody smoked everywhere so didn't matter didn't matter to much anyways however we also have this cool that will thing it's called a bit later and as you can see nowadays look hard enough you can find really cool designs on this or on these bic lighters bit gliders do tend to burn a little bit hotter the flame will start out got a little bit of a breeze going there but a breeze like that will put out a match if I had a match lit it wouldn't or if I had a match that got struck on the striking edge of the box it wouldn't stay lit it would try to and then it kind of fizzle out wouldn't make it it would probably get about that far and then it would go out and that's not to say that hold on let me just my chair here oh there we go that's not to say that Vicks are wind proof obviously they're not especially compared to a Zippo but they're a hell of a lot more wind resistant and you know wind proof than a match other disadvantages of it again if you're used to smoking your pipe and a B and M and you're amongst a certain type of crowd that tends to be very white collar and is the stereotypical pipe smoker you're gonna get a lot of odd looks lining your bowl with this lighter versus a match matches might be a little bit more respected in that environment other disadvantages of using a better a lighter like I said usually a match will start out with a very small flame though or maybe a little bit bigger than the sulfur tip so you can start out with that and build upon it it doesn't have to get you know very big a lighter will pretty much be at that be at that height until it runs out of butane think it's butane lighter fluid in anyways so you know compare that to the bowl that's why when you're using a lighter you have to hold it kind of up and move it around a little bit I mean you got to do that with matches too but you definitely have to do it with a lighter because you start out initially with a much larger flame so with all that being said probably wondering what I prefer where I stand between the two personally what I like to do is I will take advantage of the advantages of both usually what I do is I will start out with matches I will do the initial light and I'm sorry the false light and the true light inside where there's no influences of wind or weather conditions and then once I get it lit then I'll go outside or go in my car and only use the pick so to demonstrate because the winds coming from that direction such that harder to win so I say it before I start with matches see how small that flame is well no it's not first of all because it's climbing up the wood and I take advantage of the fact that matches have a cooler flame so getting the tobacco lit isn't going to you know start the tobacco up super red-hot right from the get-go then take a tamper tamp it down now normally like I said I would do a true light with the matches but because I'm outside because I just showed you using the matches because I'm outside let's go ahead and use the big lighter again you can do a true light with a Bic lighter you just got to be careful you got to kind of let it hover over the tobacco let it come in and sort of touch the tobacco and once I get it lit if it needs more relights I will use a Bic lighter because I can take advantage of the flame of a Bic lighter to go down the bull lot further and it'll keep the tobacco burning doesn't matter if it's you know I just got it lit and I set it down for a few minutes or if it's you know all the way down the chamber down into the heel of the bowl it's not to say that you can't use matches for that I've just found that it's more challenging and this is what I prefer to do what I would recommend that you guys do is find your own way of doing it well this has been DST pipe smoker with another price lucky video I hope you guys enjoyed that content I hope you got some information out of it I hope it sparked some discussion amongst the community I'm gonna sit back and relax you guys have a good weekend goodbye", "LTNjPgnAqPI": "Oh guys well today I want to talk about my table later I love this table lighter I did a video on a different one which is pretty cool but in that video I said I have one I like even more and this is the one I was referring to there's a vector brand crystal table lighter and what's cool about this is that there's a little cavity here you can put whatever you want in so right now I just have a stack of quarters and I'll show you that real quick pop that off take these out and wait a minute these are Eisenhower dollars I put quarters in there that's really really weird alright so let's back in there and you can see they're just quarters right well no the crystal actually kind of bends the light so whatever is in there from the side angle you can see its actual size right but when you turn it it looks way smaller than it actually is which is actually a pretty cool little little scientific thing there right that's what I put in there just because I like that and I thought that was pretty neat but maybe I'm simple-minded I don't know you can put what everyone here which is pretty cool you can see there's a metal base here's the actual lighter this is a big old heavy you know solid crystal base with a cavity so this goes in there I need to block the cavity and then the lighter pops on the top and as close you can rotate the light or any direction depending on how you want to look whatever but yeah I thought that was pretty neat so you could fill that with whatever you can come up with whatever you think is cool so we'll give me bears a little bit you know silver Nuggets whatever you want really but uh yeah that's what I put in there hold some coins and I know that was super cheesy to pretend like I thought I put quarters in there but hey you know what I'm a cheesy guy so that's that as far as the lighter it is perfect it works every single time right there's a little cap on there so you push the button down pops a cap first and clicks and turns on give a single you know butane flame it works every single time big important thing to me with lighters is how smooth it is actually pushed that button cuz I've had lighters that worked well but it was very hard to push the button and when you're holding it down there's a lot of spring tension there so it actually hurts your thumb it irritates you this one not so much very easy to push very simple because it's on a table lighter it has this big base on it it makes it hands-free so I can literally put you know my fingertip on there and with the other hand I can rotate the cigar and you notice it up and light it up that way so it's pretty cool and then well use the base like I said you could just pick it up to your mouth and use the lighter as is without the big heavy base so it's pretty cool but I like the kappa like that you know keep staff from getting dirty especially since I use this outside this is normally stored I'd like a little bistro table outside on my porch so I get lots of pollen and dirt flow around and stuff so having that cap is kind of important for a table later but uh you know it's really nice the only thing that's marked on there is vector on the bottom I can get that too let's lay down get that to focus so it's kind of like edged into the the crystal but I mean just beautiful absolutely beautiful these cost fifty bucks I got this one boom by lighters calm but it's also on Amazon for 50 bucks I think but uh yeah it's really nice I really like it I highly recommend it you know if you're not a cigar smoker table lighters are still nice for company I mean obviously if you allow smoking in your house or if you want to put one like I do outside because I don't smoke inside my house I only smoke outside and the deck and porch give you one more shot here of the little magic trick so they're small and then a large small large and obviously if you're a cigar smoker you can throw your you know cigar bands in there and they look pretty cool to look like a little tiny stack of mini cigar bands you know but anyway your imagination is the limit I just think it's cool it has a cavity you can actually fill when I saw this on the other website obviously with em people so this is how they're advertised you know I mean it doesn't say anything about filling it up I thought it was just solid crystal I didn't know that there was a cavity that I can fill when I got it and the first time I emptied it out I went to fill it again which by the way so holds on the bottom here very simple fly head screw for your adjustment on your flame so I filled it up and I'm way and this thing actually popped out with the lighter so I'm like oh man that's empty I can put them there you know obviously experimented with a bunch of things and use a Eisenhower dollars perfect there we go so they fit in there pretty darn well actually you know what let me see hang on a second look at that it does well so a stack of silver dollars that would definitely be cool to have in there it's small big pretty darn cool but obviously we got to fill this thing with a stack of silver dollars I mean I want to leave it outside just K so I wants to take it or something oh there you go interesting that's it thanks for watching hope you guys have an awesome day and if you have recommendations on cool table layers let me know down in the comments love to see them hope you guys have a good one I'll talk to you soon take care", "kd2dtxfTwvw": "okay so today I'm going to show you how to make a big lighter light easier now if you ever had the problem of lighting a big lighter over and over and over again to light that say some fireworks or whatever it is that you need and you keep on striking and you know that eventually your thumb starts to wear down don't you'll get a blister that's if you strike a lot of times now to prevent that all you got to do is take off the center piece right here that's all you got to do and it'll be ten times easier to light up to that hardly any effort okay so to do that all you really got to do let's go focus here all you really got to do is take off this prong first you pop it up you can go the other side of you pop it up now it's best to have one of these preferably a flat one and so you just pop those up so let me pop this up real quick for you okay so once you have them popped up like that it doesn t nuts pop them up all the way but once you get them popped up and that's where the center piece can come out then you get a bigger screwdriver if you have one because a thinner one can snap I've had it happen to me before so what you do is you get a thicker one you put it in the center and then from there all you got to do is pop it up I'll show you what it looks like after this okay so once you popped it out like that after that all you got to do just push this all the way back to here hit the gas butane in from there all you gotta do is wiggle out there you go and so and then now to fix this part right here where you took it out what you got to do is find a an edge somewhere where you can push it up against something you want to do one side at a time so push that said I first didn't push the other side in sorry it's kind of blurry it's not focusing right now push that in and then once you have it somewhat down like that Dan you just take it to your flat edge again you just push it in both at the same time trying to get as flat as possible okay so now it's pretty much you can work on it later mmm-hmm but this is just for the video so now it's so easy to strike huh I could even strike it with my index finger probably even my other fingers as well but it's kind of hard to it with one hand that's how easy but comes no more blisters on your hand or on your fingertips none of that you can do this all day in your thumb will be fine so I feel it so there you go that's a big ladder hack for you", "4HgbRtS4uj0": "all right so here's a quick survival tip for when you're lost in the suburbs and you don't want to waste all your gas and your light up to keep yourself warm it's not a fire wrap a bit of inner tube around here a mini big lotta or standard size big lotta because this stuff burns for ages and as all that it gives you a better grip on the water itself as you can say he's a little another piece of it on the ground this is really hard to do with that bit more so okay so what and that's 50 likes Mike but that'll burn for a long time and it won't blow out no we and once it started it's like a rubber fire so there you go quick tip hey Slater", "iMDkGnPkuCA": "one review interesting new products that hit the market that I thought was pretty cool this is called a lighter bro I have a several one which I've been using and there's a gold one here in the package I want to show you how you're gonna get it in the package very interesting cool packaging I like the idea of this basically it's a little multi-tool that's built into a case for your full-size big lighters so this one season they snug fit here standard bic lighter ones empty I want to keep you here to show you how this works alright so basically you gotta get it like this in the package and you're gonna insert your full size standard Vic lighter now it has a nice snug fit you have to kind of wiggle it in you can see this or even hear it but it kind of say it separates it just enough so you have constant pressure on here so you push it all the way down you go feel stop right about there alright it has a bunch of different tools in it um some of the tools are actually really really effective and they actually work really good a lot of these products like this you can see like gas station type things along a little chintzy and they kind of oh no they break easily this one is held up pretty good so far I like how it works and I think it actually is pretty useful the first thing in here is the scissors and this is what I use this mostly for it's good to have scissors on you and all you guys carry the little tour Knox's just basically for the scissors and a backup blade scissors are actually really useful there's a lot of times where you want to do something real quick and you know a knife makes a little bit harder scissors do have kind of a benefit in some marinas I'll show you with a piece of paper here basically how these cut and kind of cross they are spring-loaded scissors by the way let me show you that real quick so Victorinox style these are 420 all right they came pretty sure if you work as scissors there are effective honey all right so first similar to the corner horns or Leatherman scissors they do function they're sharp this is this little jagged edge is more or less how funny in kind of rushing the cut closest cutting a straight line but they do work they work very nicely I like the fact that they're spring-loaded they feel pretty solid I haven't had any issues so far I kind of tried using them rough to see if it would Bend or something went snap or break but it's all that really nicely so this is it work really well that's the only tool on the one side and we flip it over get a second we're gonna find two tools on the other side the first thing that's poking up a little bit further than the other tool is this Philips head screwdriver I like this this is a triple zero Phillips okay it's two inches long and has a very fine tip this is the same type of screwdriver get senior eyeglass kits I like this because I have a micro screwdriver set but my small screwdriver in that set is actually a little bit bigger than the triple zero so this for me came in handy and for the all those tiny little screws and use a you know a couple different watch styles use tiny screws like that obviously your eyeglasses although I don't use eyeglasses but it's convenient to have that you can also use this as a makeshift poker we needed to kind of scrape something out of a small channel and like this is my table or something like that so pretty handy to have a super tiny pair of shoes excuse me a super tiny Phillips head screwdriver as far as like durability obviously it's skinny it will flex but the tool is not flexing there's no playing these tools it's just obviously the thin bar so useful very useful and very different too because a lot of us are carrying multiple pieces of gear you know or kit whatever you want to however you want to put it most of them don't have a Phillips head screwdrivers that are that small so it is a nice addition if it was a standard sized Phillips I would say whatever we all have so many multi tools and so many different tools on us in general that we all have Phillips head somewhere or other but anyway onto the main thing besides the scissors we have a knife blade now a knife blade is a warm cliff it's just a straight edge or more receive so I should say now want cliff but the shoe sweat top instead of being slightly rounded it's actually completely squared off and this is to use as a makeshift flat head screwdriver now that's how it's advertised I have tried to use as a flat head but keep in mind it does taper as you get see here hopefully let me give you a good shot of that it's triangular obviously because of our grinds on both sides so I found in it does not work very very good as a flathead screwdriver all right I wouldn't really recommend it is advertised for that because of the taper it's not going to fit properly and you could snap the top portion of your edge alright so this to me is just a dedicated blade also 4:20 this is it pretty much I did use a little bit almost a stock 3 edge I'll show you this on paper it's very sharp at the bottom as we all know that 4:20 is not going to hold an edge forever you'll need to sharpen it the pros that is a very soft steel so it shouldn't be very hard to maintain a nice edge on that same thing the tool itself flexes because it's thin but the that excuse me the blade flexes cuz then but the tool is nice and sturdy inside the the base here ok so I like these they do kind of there's a little bit of a back spring to them and I said you stay open like a slip joint you know overall it's kind of a it's a novelty thing something like you might find or expect to find at a gas station but this is actually a pretty good quality example of this specific type of tool I've seen tools I see multi tools they're attached to cases for lighters just like this although the tools in those were a little bit shoddy and didn't offer what this specifically offers alright lastly on the bottom here you do have a bottle opener and I'll have a bottle of the demo here but I did use it twice to open bottles and it works and very very nicely it's a bottle opener you have a thicker lip right here across the bottom so let's say this is your bottle cap you replace it like this and then use that thicker lip to grab the edge of your cap and lift off alright so it works very nicely as well I like this I think it's really cool I don't know about the lighter bro name it's definitely it's unique some people like that some people won't um but as a tool I think it surpasses most gas station quality stuff like I said this is this is something you would expect to see at a gas station in a display you know display at twelve of them the lighter bro right so I didn't have high hopes I like the idea of trying something like this but I didn't really think that it was gonna be anything worth getting but the price tag on these are ten bucks right now it's um it's a special promotion ten bucks for free shipping it's $9.99 and the gold one usually sells I think for thirteen but that's also $9.99 right now free shipping for ten bucks I think it's worth it like I said you'll see things like this for five or six bucks at a gas station but they fall apart this one has you know it's worked well since I've had it and I don't think it's gonna fall apart anytime soon is it a novelty item yes is a useful yes it is like I said the blade nothing really to write home about but it's not gonna break on you and it does actually have a sharp edge I'm surprised by that as a nice razor edge it's just the fact that at four-twenty it's gonna you know it's gonna not stay very sharp or very long on the bonus on this one I think the fact that has scissors is great they're good quality scissors not quite I think as good as Victorinox a Leatherman or something along those lines but good enough and much better than all the scissors I've ever had in any other kind of gas station type tool but the biggest thing that sold it for me honestly is having that that tiny Phillips head screwdriver that is quite useful it's a piece of gear that I don't usually have on me I don't usually have screwdrivers that are at small so it definitely feels that specific niche or need for a tool so overall it's pretty cool later bro oh I get I think it's interesting like I said didn't use a gold one but didn't want to show that it's a very vibrant gold color so see what the package has to say great for barbecuing fishing camping everyday use wilderness survival I don't about wilderness survival I'm sure it might help you a little bit but not gonna be opening bottles and loosening tiny screws so that's a little bit of a stretch tinkering sure absolutely partying absolutely boating I suppose specs knife scissors bottle opener fits bic lighter obviously this one specifically gold titanium plate micro screwdriver under percent stainless steel he treated hardens and oh yeah there's also a keyring in the bottom little split ring I was talking with Christine about this she said I'd be cool if he can hang out of keys that she mentioned that before she knew she had this before it had a little spy ring on it and I have to admit I personally don't like chunky keys but you guys have no problem with it this might be a good base if your sodium carries a Bick all the time anyway in your pocket you might as well just hang your keys off of this and have this as your main tool on your keys if that's what you specifically do but for me personally I mean I would put this on the keys but I do not like bulky keys at all I'm already starting to bulk it up with all my tools and stuff like that so as a keychain tool yeah it'll definitely work for you it'll keep up the lighter very secure there's no way this is gonna shake out with use so I don't you have to worry about that at all so yeah this that's the lighter bro something brand new in the market for well came out of 2013 but still new to me I think it's pretty cool I think it's worth the 10 bucks I saw this at a gas station for you know ten bucks I probably get it but I wouldn't have very high hopes for it and actually using this I think it is better quality it's not amazing it's not awesome but it's definitely really cool and it will hold up better than most of the things you're gonna find any gas station you know so that's it hopefully guys enjoy the review thanks very much for watching hope you guys have a great day and I will see you soon take care", "SU8mMuTVFyg": "you know - I'll just break the ice with a flick am i big what I want to call my chick all I do is flick my big three to the big huh oh absolutely the big sigh why just light up when you can flick your BIC it's smooth easy on the thumb and you get thousands of flex from the single BEC they beg for your time stop putting your big", "aqUHRzZGSQU": "hey right Samia where Jones back for new video keep your old lighters I came across this prepper hack a while back and and it run and I want to share with you guys a little trick I oh I haven't seen a video online so I guess I'm gonna be the first person and please make a video put this on YouTube but once you guys to check out something see I got some cheap lighters I gotta give a shout out to big big make some pretty good lighters doesn't say all the companies they can't make it they don't make good lighter see if he has a there's a it's just kind an off-brand this much less and fuel in it but these nothing nothing so the fuels all use out at least three lighters now I'm pretty sure you know for those of you with maybe smoke or if you just like to collect you know fire starting equipment you may think of these are you know these are done and there's no no there's no good use for the math you know once I used up but I'm gonna show you guys a trick just so you can see how these are actually still very useful so I have right here out this from outdoor element and it's like a moat it's a multiple tool is a multi-tool hook it's has a cocaine this a carabiner they can call up 200 pounds cuz I'm meant for climbing but you know I can hold other stuff as a seatbelt cutter a little flathead screwdriver has a little spot right here where you could put you know some 550 paracord you can want to you know use it to use as an intent use this as an attachment but also it has a fire [ __ ] now all this is is an old wheel it's in flint stored in this section and basically you can come up you can come up to wherever you want to start wherever you some tips our firehouse and tinder and then they strike it it's kind of show you how effective this is I got some con swabs here hope you guys can see this and they're gonna fray this it's where the fibers are kind of helped me through sigh for a second he's it's just what you do it yeah a candle I can't al it but the same trick can be done with these so at the end of this console op see and this doesn't make a spark so let's see if we can get this q-tip lit the same way you know it was able to with the fire beat hey check that out right there and the fire is still going and it's still a bit of fuel left on this like that see if you can so you can get all this used up he's another lighter you know so these are still usable when it comes to you know getting fire started you still get some dried some nice dry tinder and you get a fire started with just a lighter that has no fuel in it because you still use the knurled wheel and the flint that's inside now let's say that something something with this is damaged or you know you're you have no room you have a little use for this but you still don't want to throw this out so I'm gonna show you something that you can do you can scavenge these four parts multi-tool do is you kind of get this metal cover off and pry this off like that as you can see you still have a see see right and now this is war this will now work just as good as this and save it save you a couple bucks I forgot how much I paid for this before you know you know you can find these line out the line in the street and trash cans what-have-you and they're still good so I mean I think I think I've even seen some things you can buy on my own line where it's set up like this just doesn't have a reservoir for fuel that you would have no oh no a regular wider so you can still use this it's probably more effective firestarter with the I guess with them I guess it's a burner with a burner removed but I'll say that you want to actually get some you need some means that means some Flint well and if you have this but somehow you can't use this so for your fire pry this off and look at that hope you guys can see this for those who use it but who use Zippo lighters you know how how valuable this stuff is so now look at that they clearly cost you anything and I ever you have some good Flint all right there you say anything with this one glove bulky tools see just as effective see there you go there's a little bit of Flint right there but we're not done yet there's still some more things you can get from this these are still some more valuable things in these in these lighters now let's say that you uh you have a mechanical device that is missing a spring and look at this you get a small spring available right now from this lighter this looks somewhat about the same size now if you have a 1911 where your slide stop and safety with that section where as their section where do you know their the the springs but is this is a spring and there are two plungers yeah so there's this five stop plunger and the safe in their safety plunger this spring is about the same diameter as as the one that's in the gun so this can be so you can if not that you could use this for parts see these another thing let you know the spring in here yep break the slider open see the joys of scavenging see it let's see I'm gonna see if this is that there is one in this slider so I found one in a different lighter but there's not one in that one I'm gonna see look another spring in this lighter see there's some spring tension in this one crack this open let's see I may have dropped it oh wait see notice I hit well when I want to demonstrate was there was actually a lighter I had and there was another spring inside of it let me see if I can get one out of this hi this slider no shame in my game folks yeah this one this one might have one you see [Music] okay let's see she's gonna spring like I was telling you about the Flint drop somewhere I don't see on a table and you see if I can get this thing kicked apart even further now regionally one reason I'm doing this video because you know I like the I'll only let the fine dig dig dig your certain place for parts oh wait your is now wait this isn't you look at that well all I did Flint and this is from an empty lighter you think that just get thrown out along with this good Flint let's see I'm always like I'm going to see what can you know can stop what can be recyclable from stuff that's already you know I saw use that might be used up for us you know for his main purpose trying to just my put yourself yeah you go no the spring size that spring I think in an ar-15 this spring might fit right underneath the extractor or you know or if if you have a shotgun this might fit I'm also in the underneath the extractor plunger so there plenty of there's still new uses for yo junk lighters if you guys haven't come across some it might not be a bad idea to keep some keep some handy yeah you know that way you have a you have a good supply of flint and you have some good Springs in on one hand or like I said if you don't want to just if you don't necessarily need to take the thing I'll take the whole thing apart you can still use the lighter has a fire starter just like on this fire [ __ ] but that's all I want to show you guys hope you guys found this video useful I want to say you know Alyssa to give a thanks to those who have checked out my channel and who was subscribed hope you guys enjoying the content I hope you look forward for more videos to come and you might get a trip again it's very important to be able to you know make some make light and there plenty of things around you where you can know you can still do that it's actual across this light and this one right now the only thing that right now lit up is this candle and my laptop that's what video I hope you guys enjoyed this information and you comments questions please feel free to submit you know leave a comment like any gripes complaints send me a PM I see record and address them but that's my video keep your old liars I met where Jones thanks for watching", "_PSzM5DpQyE": "okay so I'm going to let me fill the slider I'm sure how to do it do I usually take electrical tape and peel out about that much sound like that and cut this in half lengthwise and then okay cut it in half and then do i do is i take butane bottle or whatever and wrap the top of it see it right we can wrap it's going to fill that wants to be big enough to wear it and wear it clogs the hole on the butt just big around is the hole in the bottom of the lighter that little round part and hotel right now baby it's that big around Nancy it's a used to be a little bit bigger so I take the other piece over here I cut in half add a little more on like this right probably about about that big is probably not and then this always slide down the post here and so what I do is I I'll take it all I'll hold this hold it tight and wrap it around the bottom get it and pull it towards stretches and then stretches in little crack in there stretches in the bottom of the low part of the thing there and they want it to be far enough down here to where the tape gets in between the pen that moves up in the valve that moves up and down and the outside the can you want to jam up on you but um test a butane bottle right I've already taken a pushpin the pen thumbtack or whatever and I broke the end off a lot of people did you put a poke a hole with the thumbtack and then put the butane in and try to put the thumbtack in there afterward good just this is how I do it um cut the end off like that right here Zander here hey there's um and I've already broken it off and then it would lie to go take the lighter right and then see this bottle fits it's just pick around as the bottom of the lighter and then so it's going to seal the outside and put the pin the pin fits in the center of the hole here in the beat in the bottle without C without them without getting clogging it up and then so then I want to put it right in the center the lighter there and I'm going to go like this grab with the pliers and I put my thumb up here I go like that push down in there and then I'm gonna push it almost all the way in there hit it anywhere but you're much too little to enough even if where you can pull it back out and see it but here's the ball bearing I mean just gotten through the valve and now even though it's already empty lighter still when I pull the valve when I pull the needle back out you'll hear this release some of the pressure yeah okay and then as if I pulled it out too much and then I can be would be able to wiggle back and forth but I can't so it's that's perfect it you can do though you can hear the gas leak out but you can't wiggle the wiggle to pen and then so that's stuck there right and you can it's gas can we pass the pen so what I do as a part you don't have anything on or any flame or anything is very very explosive do not try this at home but um I guess this is just how to do it but you're not supposed to do it um here we go and then hold it I'm gonna hold it like that I usually get like the pliers these things get them ready so um easily grabbable and I take and then just what I do hold the lighter down here and then can and I'm just going to push down seal it and then might spray over my not okay yeah I'm going to release it grab the pliers and hit the pin the rest gland there you go it's in there I'm going to wait a couple seconds because the but it's got some of the fluid on the bottom of it get it out there and then here's the pin sticking out same lighter that's all there is to it alright but", "j2neb2ZaaUU": "is Davida wanna show you guys how to refill big lighter the five things you need are thumbtack big lighter the butane and the right head and not last but not least the cloves step 1 so you got to grab a thumbtack in the lighter and you got a puncher a hole on the bottom of the big lighter just like that second step you gotta look for the ticket ahead and you gotta grab a view tank you put put the head on the butane and then you start recruiting the lighter step 3 you got to make sure it's a perfect fit it won't leak out for minis inside and then you just push down on the view tank you start feeling the life step 4 you gotta release it and immediately put your thumb on it Daniel grab the you grab the thumbtack sorry about that you put it in the lighter and that's all finished that's how you reveal a big lighter", "5aWHDWLagrg": "alright YouTube as promised this is the how to take apart a lighter actually I have two sides types of lighters today I have a newest tile the childproof with the special piece of metal over its supposed to keep kids from flicking it then you get the older style letters here the traditional traditional Flint so I'm gonna take these apart and show you how to do it so when you throw these in the trash you're not so I'm just a lighter with a little bit butane if it gets popped open and you'll hit the sparks just right you know have a potential disaster so really doing this is a safety in how to at the same time Sutton and my cat decided she wants to go in the window but was it yes we so we'll start with the gold school and I'm going to take off the cover here since you're like storming good oops ended up something don't sit on the table somewhere anyways okay so that's that came out looking a little too easy alright so now when you down to two tabs and then back should be able to pull all this stuff out then take this cover off if you saw that there's a little bit smoke there since troubling what's okay all right so now get nothing but the valve it up you'll hear a hiss so I'll be quiet you can hear it guess it wasn't that much in there now tell something I'm gonna go tell I'm just going to dump out what's ever left inside of here sure it comes out tip that out and then this is sick even for my cat to you as well if I cleaned it a little better and put some tape over it so they didn't chew into it but yeah I mean this could be a cat toy right here perfect cat toy all you needs all you need is a little duct a duct tape or electrical tape so I'm going to start with the next one I'm going to do is the new one so I'm gonna do the same thing take off the cover okay and then take off this metal strip like rubbing it in the front here you kind of just pulling it back who came out then I'm going to do the same thing we're going to bend these two back but carefully so you don't but this will spring out if you don't stop it from it popping out of there let's go flying like that stuff just did spring goes inside of there and I'll end this down again take LP yesterday components spring and that's as far as I can go with it I could you know take something and punch this valve open so it would release all the butane that's in there but it's too much work it's a lot of work it's not easy Zee punched through this thing either probably done for a reason but anyways that's the video my you're a much wait awaited video I just turn these two lighters you can smell the butane who into like this little scrap pile of parts here or garbage however you look at it yes thank you for watching the video hit like if you liked it leave a comment if you want and that's it have a good one tube", "D4vnx4HoF4s": "hey youtubers in the last video I did a comparison between a Bic lighter and a dollar store lighter for 50 cents and in this video I'm going to be doing a comparison of a few different types of lighters normal lighter or a Bic lighter electric lighter or Zippo lighter here so without further ado let's get into the video alrighty guys so in the last video we used this fan to simulate wind it's a fairly small fan and in this video we may be using this fan as well which is a much bigger fan so we'll show you kind of how these different lighters work with the different fans and fan speeds so here we have our Zippo lighter or bic lighter and our electric lighter so this one you have to charge you have a charging port USB micro USB charging port in the bottom there did you have to charge it up and then once it's charged it'll last quite a while and basically how it works is you just push the button and it'll zap and to see how well these things light we'll use the backside of a match now the obvious thing that isn't so great about this one is for one thing you have to charge it so if it loses its charge somehow then you're out of luck furthermore it only has a very small point where you can put your item that you're burning and between there so a match works but it's actually pretty close as well so we're going to try lighting up a match so that doesn't take too terribly long to light up and then in terms of a breeze I'm going to just take our bigger fan here put it on the lowest setting and you can see that doesn't really seem to affect it even when you put it through the medium setting and the high setting that's a lot of breeze so you could potentially you don't want to take take a stick or something like that that's small enough and start it on fire with this lighter so that works decently well and now on to the bit lighter so the bic lighter as we saw in the previous video it works okay especially indoors but when you add any sort of breeze or wind or anything like that you know this is the lowest setting on the big fan and that will not light and with the other fan we just turn it on so the high setting it will not work on the high setting the low setting doesn't seem to want to work either so we turn it off and you got a flame so those are very wind dependent they don't work very well and wind at all now this lighter is probably one of my favorite lighters the Zippo lighter it's a very wind resistant and this pops out so you can refill it with lighter fluid and then pop it back in place the one downside to this one is that it uses a lot of lighter fluid so you might it might only last a day on the lighter fluid that it has in it and if you're considering like backpacking type stuff this is a fairly heavy lighter so you know you have a flame there like like so and you know we got the lowest setting on the on the big fan and it doesn't go out we put it on a medium setting it still doesn't go out well I did there but here we have it still burning can see that and it goes out on the highest setting that's I mean that's a lot of wind so that works really well and then another thing is if you don't want to blow it out to put it out you just put the cap over it and it goes out so that works really well as well so if you guys liked that video at all give me a thumbs up subscribe to my channel and I will see you guys in the next video thanks for watching", "ABeVRX-e5wg": "welcome back guys I am Zell and today we're talking about lighters you know many of us have one of these whether we're smokers or not we've got one of these guys and we use it for you know whatever starting a fire or maybe just putting away in our go packs and whatnot and the Zippo is a great lighter but you know it's kind of big in fact it's really big whenever we talk about packing stuff away so I was rather surprised a couple weeks ago if you didn't watch my Instagram I wasn't sure where it came from but I ended up with this little pillbox looking thing and I think he came from Blade HQ guys over blade HQ I really thank you for throwing this in the Box I if there was a code or something I'm sure I didn't put it in there but in fact I know I didn't but you sent it anyhow and I appreciate that this is a grind works warhead cylinder lighter or pill lighters what they're called quite often pillbox lighter and what's cool about this is the size it's just under two inches tall and just over and a half inch in diameter so it's a really really small little lighter weighs less than an ounce works very similar to a Zippo you unscrewed a little cap here and there you go put the cap back on of course it's nuts it out and it has down in here it has a nice little o-ring so that you don't end up with fluid everywhere if you do put this guy on your keychain to do anything with it it's very much like a Zippo you pull a little cylinder out of the middle put your fluid down in there and also that's where you replace your Flint and it uses standard Zippo Flint's just slide that back in there and you're all good to go see if we can get it to light hey there you go win on the first time that time but anyhow the reason I bring this thing up is there are several different models this one's from grind works like I said it's called a grind works warhead cylinder lighter watertight cylinder lighter nice polish kind of chrome body of course I've carried it around a little bit and it's got beat up but the cool thing here is this one you can buy many places for just for under five bucks and if you want titanium or any of the fancy fancier materials or fancier designs on the outside you can still get them for less than 20 bucks I saw several of them even a titanium one for like eleven or twelve dollars so very inexpensive way to have a sealed lighter with you you know and that's a beautiful thing and that's really all there is to say about this we've got the little thing up here got a split ring and it comes with a little bathtub ring type thing a little ball chain very very neat little lighter anyhow guys I thought you might want to see this it is rather cool or at least I thought it was and I really appreciate you stopping by and hanging out with me for a minute don't forget to Like share and subscribe it's always awesome whenever you guys do that stuff and you have a wonderful day and I'll see you next time [Music] [Music]", "0auhIvKuyfA": "what's up guys today we're going to be talking about the humble clipper lighter but before that a word from our sponsor me I make it sell BB machine guns they're the most advanced thing you could imagine as far as they go if a BB gun could grow up it would kind of be like crossing let's say Kobe Bryant with Stephen Hawking and a space ninja anyway here's a picture of two of my sent out last week here's one I just made anyway I figured if you are interested in clipper lighters you might also be interested in this I will be testing this one out on my youtube channel probably tomorrow so if you want to see that go ahead and hit the subscribe button in the Bell and you will be notified when that test goes down alright without further ado let's get into the Clipper lighter I apologize in advance for the unprofessionalism in this video I cannot find my tripod however don't let that fool you no one in this video is actually being paid alright if you've never seen a clipper lighter or heard of it before what they are is obviously lighters but they're refillable and you can change the Flint by pulling this out unscrewing it and putting another Flint in and you're good to go one of the coolest things about these lighters is that you can use the food service butane cartridges like this now these are really cheap I think these run about two dollars a piece so if you came across this video it's probably really late at night and you're bored and you've got absolutely nothing else to do except go to bed but before you do go to bed I'm gonna show you some cool things that nobody has shown you about this stuff so hang on these lighters don't come this full so I guess you know you possibly could use one of these as a level but I'll show you how to get it this fall first we want to get all of this butane out of this lighter now I've had this cartridge in the freezer for I don't know 15 20 minutes it's like magic all right we switched out the cartridge now this has been outside and it's probably I believe about 50 degrees let's see how much so this cartridge is 65 fahrenheit something like that all right now obviously you know there's a liquid in here so the liquid is gonna be on the bottom and the gas is going to be on the top filling it do the opposite and have your lighter upside down we'll see how much we can get in here so that's pretty good you can see the levels right there now what we're gonna do is we're gonna put this in the freezer okay it's been I don't know ten minutes so let's go get the lighter out of the freezer see we're level is this is the warm cartridge okay that is almost all the way fall we just got a little bubble in there let's let this warm up and see if that bubble gets any smaller okay I warmed it up in my hand as we can see the bubble completely disappeared so what we have is a completely full clipper lighter now this could potentially be dangerous for one thing there's more pressure in here now than is supposed to be normal butane pressure at room temperature is about 50 psi and you know I was watching this I was shaking it in my hand and the bubble will get smaller smaller smaller I tried to catch it on video when it just disappeared but it just down to nothing but it's also kind of cool cuz check this out I have to warm it up a little bit more within the hand I guess all right I didn't exactly get the result that I wanted to I don't think I let it warm up quite enough but as far as like the safety of this what I was thinking is that if he gets over pressurized what's probably gonna happen it's the jet he's probably gonna start leaking so let's see if it is leaking by the way I went ahead and I put this back in the deep freezer and charged it again and when I pulled it out of the deep freezer and charged it didn't have well there was a bubble to begin with but after I charged at that time it completely disappeared while it was cold and it's it's not it's not not room temperature yet it's still pretty cool but yeah it is leaking so little probably happen is that'll continue to leak down until it gets to a pressure where the the internal pressure isn't opening that valve so I guess the only way it could be dangerous as if that valve got stuck it's kind of like doubles as a a blow-off valve for it so we're going to let this warm up and let's see if we can do it now whoa yep sure can let's try it upside down let's see what we can get once it warms all the way up so while we're waiting ahead another one in there that I did the same thing to let's see if I've been playing around with this one for longer the white one was a completely brand new yep that one's leaking too [Music] so they both appear to stop leaking another thing about these clipper lighters these are the full-size ones this is a mini big for comparison let me go get a full-size big and there we have a full-size big and particularly during the winter this time of year you're more likely to find discarded lighters and they probably still got a little bit of fuel in them they just need to be warmed up but for that reason people will just throw them away and bic lighter Flint's if I haven't already mentioned it are longer it usually when you find an empty bic lighter and you pull the Flynn out of it it's longer than the one that comes with a clipper but you can just pop it right in the Clipper lighter and yeah if you get your buddies if you smell it I don't smoke but if you get your buddies buying clipper lighters and they come over and leave their lighters out you now know how to steal their fuel and you could just pull this out and swap it for theirs if you wanted to or completely charge it up and there's a prank whoosh but if you blow one of these up and hurt yourself so there it is the humble clipper lighter they also make them in a smaller size ordered some of those very cool little product and don't forget to subscribe to my channel so you catch that test into that BB machine gun if you see this video and time drop a comment below on something you would like to see get destroyed they're actually pretty doggone powerful and I guess I'll see y'all later", "R5VXim4mGjM": "hello guys mr. David TZ here and today I was going to show you how to mod a bit collider if you don't know how to do this one thing I do not condone smoking I am underage so I do not smoke but I do use lighters like lighting candles like regular use but um as you probably know that the BIC lighters have a childproofing a little bumper on it so if your coal if it's cold out and trying to light a fire something get warm it's pretty hard to like push down I get it to ignite but on this this this how to mod is gonna remove the childproofing so I got a dental pick and because I got it from a a high in fishing show for like hardware stuff gets kind of like random like it she was like a a flathead screwdriver be good we can use like a paperclip or something to pry with we want to do is get right about right through here oh sorry guys it's up that down but right through here and kind of pop off the metal covering like the the wing guard you'll see the like the same color plastic round so see that yeah and kind of just kind of pry it off don't be careful not to gun the plastic is I'll pop the flint wheel out and in doing that it'll disengage the these little bars loosening that and just kind of bend this back a little bit and just use kind of brute force and just pop it out this would be like that and do you think that now this is bent out so got the bended back get it so it's about face up touching about how it usually is and just kind of pop it back in sorry guys this might be a weird angle it should snap and snap so you don't have to push down the little safety guard now to light it to be a lot easier to use so thanks guys and stay tuned and I will be using my new intro that just made it was a simple one but I'm gonna start doing gameplays and whatnot so if you into that stuff look forward to it and just remember to write comment and subscribe think yes", "_nyciqcl8vQ": "welcome to another edition of the smart budget Channel and today we'll be doing a Dollar Tree product review of the clique and flame ez lite multi-purpose lighter versus the Crocs handy lighter and the reason I bring this up is because some people out there are year around type of people that will barbeque whether it's raining it's snowing or it's nice and warm outside and the thing is if you buy this particular model of a multi-purpose lighter for barbecues can those fireplaces it's okay but it's not as great as the crocks handy lighter so I wanted to do a pros and cons on on the two as you can see here on the package the clicking flame easy light multi-purpose lighter makes it easy to light your BBQ up candles fireplaces and more without having to burn your fingers this product right here is a refillable lighter and it also has a window display to see how much fluid you have in there on the back of the package here it just shows you the features it's long extended rod for reach hard to light places an ignition trigger adjustable flame control so you can make it a large flame or a small flame medium also your field window then it also has your directions how to refill your lighter on the back end of the as you can see here on the back end of the lighter you're gonna use retain fuel Universal feelin tip adapts oil refillable lighters this is the Ronson brand you have to pick that up at Dollar Tree they are actually at Walmart because they don't sell that at the Dollar Tree but the thing I did notice about this using these they burn through feel really quick let me take it out the package here now I did a Dollar Tree lighter options and I just basically touched base with all different types of lighters that they had at the time at the Dollar Tree so I wanted to be a more in-depth about this lighter as you can see up close this one's actually almost full and you have to really look at these because if you don't look at the windows before buying it it might just be half-full you know like you won't get what you're paying for you want it to least be full as you can see lights right up and this is at its max setting this is at its lowest setting and this right here is medium setting now don't get me wrong it's great to use something like this for your barbecue but again it takes up more space in your drawer or wherever you place your lighter to light up the barbecue er also again it just eats fuel right up it eats feel it doesn't last long even when you use the lowest setting and you either gotta read refuel this or toss it and get another one so I wanted to go with a better option the crocks handy lighter which I did a really review on this has electronic ignition pre-adjusted flame and a long reach nozzle this is like a mini barbecue lighter this versus this let's take this out of its package here as you can see if you're trying to save space in your drawer or wherever you put this at especially when you're going camping or anything like that you bring your little barbecue you just need a small lighter like this think of the Crocs handy later as a Bic lighter with a small extension on it okay as you can see it's got a perfectly adjusted flame it's pre adjusted so you don't have to worry about messing with any knobs like this right here where you have to adjust it this you it's pre adjusted so turn on perfect flame not too long doesn't take too much space nice clicker on it very simple this is not refillable though as this one is but this lasts a long time this will last you way longer than these will so if you want something for your barbecue and this is something you keep in your drawer and it's not gonna take up too much space like this will this is the better option hands down better option and they make this they say it's child resistant but I don't really consider it because if there's no package advertises that it's child resistant here on the back says it's a child resistant multi-purpose lighter I'm sorry but my kid can't click this right on and start a fire so you know make sure you put this in a safe spot and of course you know when you buy these at the Dollar Tree you got to be 18 and over anyways so just make sure to keep these away from children but you know when it comes to pros and cons on both yes this is refillable which you have to go and buy this just to refill it and it's a big pain to refill these anyways whether we can get something like this it's quick its disposable and it's a lot smaller it's more compact and you know a lot of people like to use these for their pipes and things like that when they're smoking tobacco or whatever else are smoking you know so they'll go with this option so they don't they're not doing this with their dick and burning their fingers and stuff so this is the better option for all that and again this is like a mini barbecued lighter and it's just amazing how long these last versus these so overall performance crocks handy lighter is gonna get a thumbs up this barbecue lighter from the Dollar Tree will get a thumbs down just because it burns through fuel like crazy and if you want to buy something that's decent and lasses definitely this one right here is the better option again this is the smart budget Channel and if you needed

we're going to do another Ward's test when these lighters this homeowner is using a standard bit lighter so I'm going to dunk in sink and then we'll see how quickly it dries out so if you use it it was in a survival scenario and because it's bit light for it's all self-contained at the bottom there it's actually seals rather than having a valve so that Bix by default aren't refillable however it does mean that they are so only better guarded against the elements you have to excuse my voice I think I've got a bit this sort of sort fro coming on I should have demonstrated that it's lighter actually work before putting it in the water but I'll dry out now and we'll see you can get it going well it's been over 20 minutes now I've tried drying it out and rolling the sort of Flint along and it's not really like injury and a bit of a spot wherever not consistently so I'd say the Bix failed this test I know a lot of people like these lighters but I think in terms of survival lighter they're much better options out there ones like I've got with the plastic case that may it make it flow in the water and being completely waterproof and the piezoelectric bits actually lit a lot faster than this thing with a busy electric Clipper so yeah it turns out an old bit lighter isn't great at being a sort of waterproof survival lighter", "-n0hnBvJK-w": "so today i was wondering if child proof safety locks work on lighters let's find out i have somebody here he's going to introduce himself go ahead and say your name and your age okay and he didn't want to put his face on camera so we're gonna go ahead and try this out and mages in the background say hi mage okay anyways so all right hector go ahead and try and spark that later for me and it and just so you can see hold on let me grab it real quick okay so just so you can see here we have just a regular bic later okay it's used still has a little bit of fluid has the safety lock okay let me see your hand hector put your hands here put your hand flat put it like mine okay so almost the same get in there getting older so let's see how you hold it okay now let me hold it okay i'm gonna spark it so you can see it works right here let me do it without the light all right okay there we go again all right nope i just got the little corner part of your face but go ahead so here's his hand there you go so you got it right how hard was it for you to do it a little hard well before i told you how to do it how hard was it really hard a little like if i wouldn't have told you would you have figured it out by now a little because i did it in the past but okay i kept on trying because i have little fingers all right so let's see do it again so there you go folks you can see go ahead and do it until you get it sparked up again you can use either hand you can use both hands however it works okay that's mine on the floor right there too by the way all right however long it takes men don't know pressure at all okay okay i just want to see how good these work and then i'm going to pop the pin out of there and i want you to try it again okay we'll see what the difference is that's good you're using your brain trying to figure it out so i guess whoever engineered this took some time to try and figure it out too huh because it looks like it's working look at it look around all the way around check it out see whatever you think works okay it's pretty crazy huh it's like an aerobics cube trying to line up all the colors have you ever tried to do that i only did like three of them that's pretty good i can't i haven't even done one whole one yet my buddy kirk can do it in like a couple of minutes it's hard just let me know if you want to give up whenever you want to okay okay just keep on doing until you can get spark up again you got it one time so i'm sure you can do it again you can see it just so i can show everybody that it's still the same later okay and just so you can see how to do it one time okay one more let's see how you go okay good job man try it again okay keep on going until you i mean unless you're done because you gotta spark again okay so here hold on to this um here hold this for a moment let me go grab my knife you can keep trying too if you want to record okay all right so you got it okay now let me show you something now we're gonna do it without go ahead and bring it over here so you can see them late so i'm just gonna use that one i guess so i'm just gonna pop the safety out okay watch your face okay safety's gone see the difference yeah okay yeah all right that's the leatherman wave plus we'll do a review on that later on but um all right go ahead and try it again all right pretty crazy huh yeah so what do you think what's your opinion on child safety proof on lighters do you think it works yeah it works you think you'd get it eventually uh yeah you think you'd get bugged out and throw it away before you even try maybe yeah okay all right man well i appreciate you doing this for me taking the time out me and uh hector here about to go play some gun game on call of duty mobile oh snap do it again like there's two puck in your shirt in the background too dang rest in peace like he's even looking like he's thinking hard on how to light it up anyways we're gonna play some call of duty what's your gamer tag uh it's supposed to say no one kills me but it says on one kills me all right there you go folks accident adam call of duty mobile until next time bring them up", "dBcrWGYBKo8": "well here it is 275 lighters of it I need 1,800 to

you know the cheap ones you get from the 99-cent store maybe your corner grocery store these guys here are the clear ones that you can adjust and they finish up you don't know what to do with them so you throw them out where do they go where the happens to them thousand years from now who knows well I have a solution I just take it apart give all the parts to recycle this is how we do that start with the cover silver Java here take a fingernail and pull the cover away like that you see this we have enough light lighting director you have enough light grab it should come off pretty easily next part is this is already half way off there's a spring underneath and a flint it's going to go flying so keep your hand around it like that when that things go [Music] this spring step two you get to pull apart these prongs a little bit more and take out the plunger this one side and the other bring it up swivel it around is attached over here and pull straight out comes underneath that is our little adjustment lever it'll come straight up off the top and then we try to take off the outer case oh come on pretty good this time or not and only have left two beer is to unwind this doesn't even hiss which means it was completely out Kevin music apart to roll done [Music] look at all that junk look at all that junk so what we do with this thing well I do is I put it with all the other ones and that's been today's green tip from Bruce ad bench dogs hello okay would you like to get out of the light please", "Og2e5RRtcv8": "this loo cooks mr. Bill's not a 90-year most survivalist will talk about using flint and steel to make fire rest assured throughout history it's done an awful big job of doing just that making fire but today we're just a little bit more advanced than that and there's no reason to be in the Stone Age all the time not that you can't carry them I'm just saying there are options most of us carrying some kind of a lighter you don't have to smoke to carry a lighter by any means I've never smoked in my life and I've always carried some kind of lighting device but today I'd like to discuss something that's just a little bit more power than that and that sees small torches refillable torches under a $5 bill I said under a $5 bill and yet still extremely effective at getting fire to be made you bet and you can stay back it's not a finger burner like these old boys are you bet and it does a pretty good job and unlike these sometimes they'll spark forever and you can't get the flame to go these are pretty good about lighting under all kinds of conditions with that in mind though they've got a big boy now that is a straight fight on our bill it's got a safety on it at the same time and on the awful lot more liquid to be able to put a fire on 2,300 degree temperature and rest assured when you kick that bad boy on it's ready to go and you've got fire just that quick and it puts it straight out a lot safer no finger burning but having some this is well worth owning very lightweight can put it in each vehicle but one in your day pack maybe your bug-out pack well worth it for a five dollar bill in my opinion this look good mr. bill is just saying this isn't your father's lighter anymore considered for the future for yourself for your family though have a good day", "cB6_eo-k1Cg": "hey everybody this is a informational slash public service announcement barbeque lighters also known as a manned flame by script though our aim and flame too are not known to be very reliable I think that's due to how people use them people squeeze the trigger too fast if you just squeeze the trigger slowly they always light because when you squeeze the trigger it's starting the fuel and the spark so if you squeeze the trigger too fast the fuel won't make it out of the end of the nozzle in time and the sparkle just ignite so slow this is set on the lowest setting this one has been under the barbeque for probably at least two years see how rusty it is to rust these have basically been through hell and they still work fine there are three dollars at Home Depot but people still write a ton of negative reviews because they pull the trigger too damn fast so it's made by dick there's slightly better reviews but pull the trigger slow it and it lights you", "97Ne6b5-qWo": "on this episode of Scott vs.

today tube so basically what this video is about is if you have one of these blues you might be wondering why there's a little blue light that blinks on the very end of it when you try and hit it and then you are unable to actually hit the device or get a toke you can call whatever you want but I'll show you exactly what I mean you can see that little blue light blinking at me on there basically what is happening and there is one quick and very easy fix to this you're gonna want to pull out the end cap that actually holds the juice in it and for my case I actually have a micro processor tool luckily for me you can use a very thin knife you can use your screwdriver you can use an assortment of many different things but at the very bottom of these liquid capsules there are two little iron prongs or whatever they're made out of there but there's two little prongs at the very bottom and what you're gonna want to do is you're gonna want to take the side that isn't attached into it so you'll see it kind of makes like a a linear path across and I'll let circles down in the actual device itself but then there's another side that it has a flap on and you're gonna want to take that and then just kind of push it up just like that and then you're going to take the other one and do the exact same so you can actually go in from the very side of it just like so then you can just lift up so when you have these two up I'm not sure if you can see it too well they're actually quite small but once you prop those up just a little bit there are two little prongs back on the inside of the blue itself that these button these touch and activate to those it makes it so that you can actually keep up the juice inside of this capsule so when you push this back in now and give it a good click

the front and go like that there you go simple as that kids don't try this at home", "yLit1B7TtPo": "hey everyone out there we're gonna do another video today we're gonna do one about some older lighters that I have they're not Zippo they're I don't know just different older lighters or older style lighters you'll see here in a second all right we'll start with this one it's like a table top is what they call it or what they used to call it I don't really see them anymore because people don't really smoke inside but anyways used to put that on your table and then when anybody wanted to smoke a cigarette inside you know you would use this because you know you're not going to be carrying this around so that's why they called it a tabletop lighter because it usually sat on your table and usually this think unscrews or something like that and you can look you can hide something in there if you want but that's how you refill it is it like comes apart and then you can take this out see it's like another lighter inside this is the actual lighter right here this is just like the holder see anyways got a lot of liars this is another really cool one it's probably one of my really my favorites it's a grenade shaped lighter I've never seen another one really really cool and it has a button right here and when you push that button that thing comes up and then they would light it doesn't have any oil on it I don't really keep any oil in my lighters because I don't ever use them so it would be pointless to just keep fluid in there yeah that's really cool here's another cool one this is a little bit newer but I don't know I want to say it's kind of like older style I don't know it's pretty cool though has this button right here and you push it and like a little blade comes out it's like a little letter opener a knife oh no pretty cool so yeah it's got a little button right there and you just push that button and the blade comes out it's like a switchblade but a lighter got a lighter on it to see pretty cool this is probably another tabletop lighter I would say or maybe it probably even maybe went into a a tabletop lighter because I don't know it has that look to it see how it has that Ridge right there so it looks like it probably went into a tabletop letter but yeah you would just push down right here and it was like this is a really interesting one if I can remember how to even do it to be honest with you I can't remember right off the top of my head so my letters are so different so I know it has some kind of trick to this one but I don't know anyways there it is right there I know that you taste this out and that's where you put the fluid in there right there see it's just pretty cool I was like just like cartridge but um oh you push that's what it is you have to push both sides together or something something like that I swear I'm not doing it right whatever it is yeah I really have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing we're maybe somebody out there knows how this thing works because I don't Thanks yes I own a lighter and I don't know how to works anyway it's called a regions but it's got this cool little cartridge see there's the wick or whatever you want to call it not wick but that's where the fluid goes the lighter foot and then there supposed to be a whit it's probably supposed to be longer than that but anyways that goes in there and then somehow you get the thing to spark but see I can see how it's supposed to move but I don't understand how it's a posta move I mean maybe it's missing something I don't know anyways there you go sorry doesn't really apparently want to work right now here's another one of those tabletop lighters I think it's like a smaller version or something I don't know see that one sparks I think I call these whales I don't know if they're really called whales but that's what I call them I don't know why but yeah maybe they really are called that so I must have heard that somewhere but yeah I call these whale lighters because they kind of look like whales I guess this one's really cool it's older a lot it's got dice in there really cool and the fluid I guess would just be in there with the dice I assume definitely older you don't see this one's like jammed up it's old so I didn't buy it cuz like it works I bought it cause like I don't know it's pretty cool it's got dice in there pretty cool I thought you know make lighters like that anymore here's another one of those weird lighters but I think I can actually work this one this one is made by M Co trim Plex made in Austria I think they made lighters for like War one like trench lighters I don't know if this would be a trench lighter but it's like a windproof lighter because see it protects the flame but anyways you would just pop it up like that and then it would like but ya doesn't have a good spark right now but yeah I think these are kind of expensive not like super expensive but yeah a little bit more expensive than like a regular average lighter well I didn't unscrews I don't know what's in there if I should unscrew it doesn't seem like it's doing anything but that moves right there this little thing does here's one of the smallest sliders I have it's like a mini style Zippo lighter it's not an actual a zero and it actually has a little keychain loop right there it says Korea on it I think these used to come in gumball machines if I'm not mistaken and it did I you know you could actually work it see it's made to work kind of cool real real small here's it compared to that other one that I couldn't work real small it's like the size of like a little bit bigger than a dime this is a Nimrod made in the USA I believe it's called a pipe lighter it's got this circle shaped I think you would place it over the pipe like that and then you would like the flame and then it would like the flame would go down into the pipe when you were inhaling and I would light the pipe so yeah that's a pipe later that's what that's called here's a real thin lighter like real thin look how thin that is I guess I just thought it was cool because it was so thin it's like a art deco style I'd say I don't know not an expert but I'd say it's probably along those lines this is really really cool lighter it's made in West Germany by a spirit really really interesting it's got a button right there you know I'm a fan of my buttons so I have to have everything automatic you know there you go pretty cool definitely one of my favorite lighters so yeah you just push the button pretty cool it's got this you could take that off right at the bottom right there see it opens up and that's where you put the fluid and all that Jess I don't know I've never put fluid in there so interesting looking in there don't know how it works this is just like a cheap no I think it's a little bit older but I don't know it's just cheap its metal its engraved but probably somebody just cheap engraving here's another real odd one it says arrow on the bottom it's like encased in this Jori thing but yeah it's like getting cased in there yeah it's like one it's see if you took it out it would look like one of these it would look like that if you took it out or similar to that see it has that similar shape to it and it's encased this one's a Rogers mercury made in Japan pretty cool again another one of those Whalley kind of looking heels this one's pretty cool it's made its this is the whitelighter made in Abilene Texas the white Co so this this is probably handmade I'm not a hundred percent on that but I was told that it could be handmade but yeah I think that's pretty cool this was made by a lot smaller of a company than you know Zippo or those companies I don't know maybe probably back when this was made Zippo was a lot smaller of a company not compared to this company this company is still smaller than Zippo but still you know what I'm saying but I still think that's really cool if you can see that but pretty cool by the white company the white lighter Abilene Texas and you just pull down right here know what like so that's pretty cool I think this is like brand new old stock at least it looks brand new it's a Firebird from the colibri corporation you've heard of Calabria I'm sure they make a lot of different stuff for I don't know man I guess because they make like tie pins and money clips and jewelry type stuff I don't know lighters but anyways it's kind of like a Dunhill like I don't know real light I don't know how to pronounce that but yeah it's kind of like a Dunhill has that little scroll pretty cool it's in real good condition cuz it's like always probably been in this case and last but not least this is really really cool I heard this I was told this was handmade and it really does look handmade because it's so imperfect it's not perfect at all very cool lighter it unscrews on the bottom right there I guess that's where you obviously put the fluid but I don't know it's just super cool it's got some wick in there so yeah just screw that back in there but yeah I mean you probably can't tell from the camera but it's got all these imperfect edges it's probably not even like the same side sawn both sides like I don't know how to explain it you could just see you could just look at it and see it looks like it was like handmade that's what I was told by the guy I bought it from he told me it was handmade not by him I don't think but it's pretty cool it doesn't even have a company name or anything on it doesn't have any labeling or anything but yeah pretty cool all right guys that's about it for lighters this time I have more lighters coming up I have a lot more I have a lot of lighters so alright guys I have more stuff also more than just lighters I have like vintage toys and stuff like that too alright we'll get to that on other episodes alright see you guys next time thanks and don't forget to Like subscribe and comment or

safety guard this wheel when we reinsert it has to be put in this way if you flip it around 180 degrees it won't work so I'm going to mark this wheel I'm going to mark the right side the son with my fingernail now slowly I pull it away pulling the two yolks of the mechanism very slowly there's the spring just the ferrocerium rod you so now we've removed all the different parts that we don't need we do need though the wheel the ferrocerium rod and the big spring you since we've removed the metal outer guard this plastic yoke holding the wheel in this slightly splayed and it connects notonly pop-out we don't want that so we're going to put in a paper clip they're gonna have the metal going through you bashing the metal in from the back side forward so this is what like sure hope this is gonna be in focus now we're gonna twist the wire in the front twisting also tightens it now going to cut it off this little twisty part we're gonna bash that downward so it doesn't get in our way there it's pretty much out of the way here we go there's our spark generator but it's much longer than it needs to be so we're going to cut it down it's a close-up view notice how the yoke the plastic yielding the wheel is slightly splayed if you put too much tension on that wire it's going to splay even more and then it's not going to hold the wheel in there so you want to have just the right amount of tension so that the wood the sides are nice and fairly parallel I'm going to put some protective duct tape on the top part so we don't get dust and grime inside that top element so I've taped it covered the part I want to protect now we're going to saw it off pinch insert deep let go and I saw pinch extract I think this one's going to be about a millimeter longer than my other one was I kept filing it down you let's see how this one came out as a whistle by blowing over the top and I like a pan-flute shhh shhh I'm at a distance of roughly 1 meter from the test microphone it is obnoxiously loud those people stuffed the bottom with a cotton ball or Vaseline impregnated cotton ball as your portable tinder you Wow first time again works really well I could use more of the same but I'm going to convert see how this works so that's quite a bit smaller and I still have a pocket for a cotton ball so I hear I've refined it with a file but more okay I think I can get it folded in half I think I might be able to fit the full length in yep now that is a very small one-handed fire generating kit you you have you can spark with just - and you've got ready to go tinder stored in the handle and you don't get your pants oily if you put this in your jeans pocket you don't have to worry about the Vaseline making a stain in your pocket so you hold the sparker with two fingers thumb and finger and then top finger picks spark there we go without his teeny I've put a larger split ring on the green one and I've mounted the split ring at the other end so I can dangle this nicely a on my keychain you", "R-HKiKckJIE": "- Hey, get a load of those two!

so sorry for the big light the item homes in this kind of packaging triangle shape and we see already that is the big light in the middle on the right side we have Caesar and on the left side you have a blade and a really tiny micro Phillips screwdriver on the back side we see some more information you can use that also use as a bottle opener that feature i did not yet try out that is to be seen how well that works and there we see how the big light the regular size big light just light in that item came with a little bit of sticker and the free lanyard they had a promo and that's how the item actually look that is basically a folded over stainless steel in this case silver shiny colder sleeve with split things or you can add at a lanyard doesn't have a pocket clip on this variation we see here that etching later bro and we see the cut down here is for the scissor so that you can use the Caesar Caesar works pretty gold needed a bit oil like the other tools as well it came completely dry the build quality I would say is medium too good on this a variation it's a low price item on the other side we have the blade it's a rather long the edge that they did child porn on it is unfortunately not too well at least on this sample typical chinese that is easy to be fixed to be sharpen it and i'm sure that's gonna going to be way way better cutting than it is right now there is no point march on the blade so I gonna re profile the shape of the end of the blade so that I have a bit of a point that is just personal and then as we fold that in we have here that long Phillips micro Phillips hopefully the comet of see it the head is is really tiny maybe 48 glasses or something like that or computers the air I would rather have put in a bit of a get a peek at a screwdriver t'en then this tiny one like a needle and the bottle opener is on the bottom part as well integrated now what you do you just need a big like regular size and you can put that in aid a way you simply insert the thing all the way down and it clamps with that spring-loaded sheet metal part that clamps on it pretty good and then you have the item together the weight is rather heavy that port over here and on the opposite side would have been better made in a skeleton fashion that had more cutouts for make the whole design a bit light so this item is not for ultralight backpacking that is more for people that like woman that has a purse to carry it or that you that you will leave it in the car survival item just to have like in the camp by the tent close by and all that that's what I gonna use it for that's why I did select the orange one and I gonna add on a bit a lanyard in a neon orange bright color as well so for that it's pretty nice the shininess of the material shoot of the stainless steel should prevent that it will rust pretty much what I also going to add is a rubber o-ring so that the tab not going to go down and drain the big light so that much about the light bro attachment for the light this", "UDA6G2sdZZs": "what's everybody today we are going to discuss lighters right here what all these have in common all these because there's one thing that these lighters can't do and that is be reusable so we're gonna take these away and introduce you to this we're gonna get that focus right there boom this lighter right here electrical rechargeable lighter and let's get started [Music] so you know these lighters right here they have fluid and you know they work for a little bit but sometimes they don't turn on you know you get and can hurt your hands so not some of them you know you lose like if there's fuel in there then it's able to work but once the fuel runs out you're unable to it's good for emergencies but guess what this one does this one is an electric one so it's pretty much simple and you know good for lighting candles where you can't reach you know when you burn your hands you know how like you light a candle and you kind of dip down in a in a candle and you kind of like try to light the wick on the very bottom and since it's really deep you get that fire that burns your hand a little bit because it gets hot and uh this heats up this little aluminum little thing and you start to you get all these scratches on your hand but you know why not just use an electrical one because with this electrical one it's rechargeable and it'll last forever until the battery dies or um until the battery doesn't work anymore and it's really cool because you can this one right here is particularly it can bend and so you can you know slide it down turn it on and light the candle so i'm going to demonstrate that real quick so this is just a liar that can you know pretty much electrical charge this is what like uh one one thing there's there's ones that make an x or there's two that crosses and stuff but this one works just fine so i'm going to show you that in a little bit right here so i have this candle right here and um the wick is down there so you know it's been used for a little bit and you know how you light it you can't really light it because you know unless you get one of those butane lighters that you can that's like a stick and you light it up but those go out eventually because there's very little fuel in there you don't want to keep buying fuel so instead of kind of like bending it over to light the candle just use one of these this one bends it press the button and it pretty much lights the wick up [Music] you know make sure we get hot enough and the candle's lit so as simple as that just it lasts forever you can use it for emergencies pretty much light anything and it's uh pretty safe because you know there's nothing really to it [Music] that's all there is to this it's a little safety lever too so you can't press the button you're gonna use and this one particular is made by tech life so you know right here so you like this brand go ahead and search for it on amazon and it's rechargeable as well and put that out and that's it so replace these old as lighters right here with an electric one that's what you need in your life that's all there is to this video so make sure to subscribe to the channel and i'll see you guys later peace", "HRolq906DCA": "hello I'm gonna show you how to make a secret letter compartment with a disposable lighter okay first what you have to do is you have to make sure that you have two lighters a Bic lighter and any cheap lighter you could get another bit if you want and what you do first is you take your safety pin see there's a valve right then on the bottom what you do do you take this safety pin and shove it through that hole on the bottom and make sure that all the gases come out and after all the gases come out pull the safety pin out cut make sure you cut far enough so you won't hit the valve cut it with the drummel boom that's what I prefer and then just kind of set the rest of the letter aside now you have your bottom now what you do with the big ladder I already have this one done you do the same thing with the pin to get all the gas out after you get all the gas out don't cut the lighter itself take a dremel cut a square out of the bottom so you can fit the sander from a dremel tool in there sand the whole piece so make sure you send it really nice sand as much as that middle divider out as you can and then what I did is I took the Flint out and everything else so it's just a front wheel and the button but it still looks real then what you do is you stand around here a little bit you shove that in there and that's it", "gNOWIZRx5rs":

fluid inside so I'm gonna wash it out let it dry and test it but first because I haven't even tried to well wheel turns it's full of mud so I'm gonna have to probably take the safety off I was getting ready to take it apart using the all on my swiss knife because it dried out really fast but I couldn't depress the button here I guess it had a lot of dirt stuck underneath it it would spark and add something and you can hear the fluid inside so I played around with it and eventually there you go flame had a little face where it went on constant hon no Ivor pretty cool I mean you can see it's kind of rusted and still has a lot of dirt inside it's a pretty cool thing finding a lighter full of mud very wet and then making it work so I hope you liked the video guys thank you for watching and I wish you all a great thing", "UFqyyFUlnxA": "ours eyes everyone's been asking me to make a how to make a torch lighter with a bit lighter I'm going to show you guys first thing you need is up bit lighter so firstly one of removes the ink from the pin we do this and if you want to remove safety from the lighters I've only tried down big lighter so I'm not sure about any other lighters but I know for a fact it works on a big lighter so what you want to do is you want to take the ink from the pin and you want to put just a little bit on the tip where the fuel comes out of the lighter just a little bit you want to get all around him the lighter won't ignite so just just right there on the tip as you can see see that yeah just a little bit and then replace the safety you know and after that so the only way to make yours gonna light is if there's something a puppy restricting butene from raising up so like as you can see I put my knife under here it's not gonna light like this right I don't think I should eat there it's really good if you need it like an emergency you need to eat something nuts you know how there have been a big lighters they do it this is what you guys do you know as you use it the inks didn't wear off on the where the fuel comes out of the lighter apps so you can have to reapply it every so often", "eSnUFGqf64Q": "[Applause] hello youtube today I'm gonna review this torch lighter which are very cheap and I bought it on the 15 15 pesos or 30 cents in u.s. they gave me the purple corner it's the name here is rugby just simply the ball it's made in China by Hank Chen the pitcher bit lighter is quite different from any ordinary lighter it's all although it's electric ignition the unique property of this lighter is the purse I'm going to show you this I think this is so light LED light so there is it's quite bright and [Applause] finally the picture this the unique picture is the torch it's a quite strong here you can adjust the the intensity of the fire at the torch you can minimize or maximize according to your desire okay inside position here you can try the minimum so that's it and we can trade the maximum here it's very strong yeah well that's it a cheap lighter that again it's a similar to torch lighter and I don't know what the peel will inside we might be the beating the liquid inside so it's a comes in handy and everywhere whenever you're out there with the strong wing I think this will gonna work as as what you expect yeah it's a bread claim in blue on the lower part it's very the plane is very straight forward very straight yeah in the maximum yes you can hear the ease so that's all this may rebuild this chip lighter which I bought an honest local store so I think let's say this thank you and see you later

come back on here real quick and try to do something so I'm not been doing the lighters and then I had a girl the other day asked me could we do waterproof but I don't know but yeah I remember this tape from earlier I didn't use on something which is supplying the easy paint buying a paper from like the kitchen section and one more I also got the printer labels its what I'm doing my lighters with okay um I'm not gonna waste this one in particular I got some I just messed up in size right here so before I do that I just want to see how look so I'm just going to cut that up plastic paper ain't got much better yeah so I'm right down yeah I'm trying to be quick with it so this is an idea we can do to make it waterproof this is like a this sticky paper so just check label on there and then as you know this here is already sticky so you just put it back in now further and that'll give you a shiny coat for your lighters thought I just come on real quick and show you out of it but I'm not going to weigh it this is the lighter that being used so I'm gonna just show y'all by doing this now once you put this uh labor pepper down yeah I'm telling this should be down down so you make sure you couldn't what you wanted it or it will tear now this matter it's too big for the measurements I had that's why I had to go back in and do another one so look at that so that is a way you can

calm", "rh7PklLKqTU": "hey YouTube joven here we're going to take a look at a lighter from my collection this is by the Chinese company honest they make pretty inexpensive lighters you can find various places around the net and they're much higher quality than most of the cheap lighters you can find this is the model BC Z 1 1 6 so far as I know it doesn't have a name other than that designation so let's open up the box and see what we got first thing is this pouch here which actually contains the lighter instructions in three or four languages and inside the pouch is the lighter itself this one comes with this little multi head light duty screwdriver thing I guess it's kind of like a foot doesn't it ok one thing this is actually useful for is adjusting the flame because down here the fill port for the butane you with a screwdriver you turn the little collar there to adjust the the flame up and down this body here has a sort of slightly rough coating on it has a kind of nice feel to it it's not slippery has this little medallion here that it's designed to look kind of like an old coin I think in pictures I've seen a few different medallion designs this one has an Indian head because it supposed to look like an Indian Head Penny or something I don't know it's moderately heavy not super heavy moderately heavy because of the metal body the hinge is quite solid it's fairly strong it doesn't feel like it would break easily has a kind of nice sound when you open and close it it snaps home solidly yeah and here's the flame see if I can get a dark background so you can actually see it there we go it's your standard butane jet flame but it starts very reliably I don't think I've ever had this one failed to start first time so long as the gas flow was adjusted properly other than that there isn't really a whole lot else to say about this one it's honestly not one I've carried extensively so I can't say for certain that it'll hold up you know four years of heavy use because I don't know but the quality seems good in my experience with other honest lighters is that it probably will so this video is just for the benefit of anyone who wanted to maybe see some video one up close before they picked one up so since I've run out of things to say I'm going to close out now and so this is Jobin saying remember where your knife is", "0_uOFO5aiys": "hey guys Glenn here and I'm going to show you how I make a Bic lighter work when it's wet it's always a lot of talk about bic lighters getting wet not working but it's actually not that hard to make one work when it's wet so yeah the bic lighter you know the push-button world get your get your flame right like that so how does it work well you got the little wheel on there which has teeth on it which go in one direction so that's one thing to remember it's like soft so it's only got on spin in one direction and cut the flint and the flint is actually a small ferrocerium rod if you've ever had one torn apart it's probably about a half an inch long when it's new and it's pushed up against the striker wheel by a small spring it looks like a spring from an ink pen so that's how you get your spark and then there's an office or a little jet that the butane gas comes out of and then that's controlled by valve which is a little hand button a little finger button so when the when the butane starts to flow as a gas it's it's not real high pressure so what it needs to do it needs to mix with air so there's some little slots on the front of the chimney and that's where it draws in the air from the speed of the butane very similar to the torch it's the same thing as a torch on the torch down below the tip there's air holes here just above the orifice for the fuel so as a fuel speed is going through here it grabs the air so that's one thing to remember about when it's wet because that wharfe sits in air or the jet is very very small so getting the water out of that it's no big deal the thing that you got to do is draw the Flint and the striker wheel enough to produce a spark so show you how to do that one thing about bic lighters now if you're old like me you've been around long enough to remember when a Bic lighter actually had a flame adjustment on it and this little metal cover up on the top of the striker wheel the child proof that wasn't there so the trick that i'm going to show you is something that doing 30 years ago I work outside I'm a carpenter so that means you know I've been out in the rain to snow whatever and eventually the lighter ends up wet and I smoke so if you need to use your lighter you figure out how to make it work so before the little wheel was covered by that safety tab it was wide open which is what you have to do so the first thing that you're going to want to do your lighter gets wet or packed with snow what have you let's take your multi tool or tip of your knife or something and get that little wheel off of here alright little cover it's a little child proof cover a little metal thing on the on the wheel there so I've already taken it off of this lighter and this lighter as you can see is in a glass of water so however you got wet doesn't matter but just shake off what you can of the water now you may be completely wet because you went into drink and that's how your labor got wet so I'll show you something else but just blow it out maybe hit the gas a couple times because I will clear it out or if this now the big problem is to get that striker wheel dry and get the flint drive because probably a little bit of water down in that travels and easiest way to do that with the valve towards you because that's the direction that that wheel want to go as you can see it's not lighting let's take it on your pants you're basically just striking that Flint now you can try it it's not going but the trick to this is not to use your thumb because your thumb you're only working off the side see that black that's that's because that striker wheels still wet use your finger put your finger up on top of the wheel so you got more travel and pull it down and you'll get a little spark here still got a little bit of water in it so we'll run it a couple more times might run this one out of fuel their line so I gotta do it still got a little water in it because sparking up but from a lighter that went in the water to that didn't take long to get that to dry out to where you could use it it's still easier to take your finger or more successful and run the long way and just get right down on that valve get get the fuel going now one other trick you can do if the water was cold that you went in butane when it's cold as you know with a Bic lighter if the lighter is cold you're going to get a shorter flame and it's warmer day you're going to get a taller plane you teen needs to be warm to produce the gas so all you gotta do put it between your hands and get a little friction going make some heat and it burns so now you're thinking okay well I just fell in a creek or whatever and my jeans are wet so i can't really dry out the wheel on my wet jeans can do the same thing just take a stick small diameter stick that will catch on the finger grooves of the wheel and just run it on that run it till you dry it out I sure it's probably going to wear out the Flint that's in there but if you have to have a fire and only one fire and this is your only chance and worry about that Flint just get your fire going so hope that helps with a wet lighter that's what's worked for me for years so give it a try see how it works thanks for watching", "qetDUR7otE4": "our tweet format Coughlin's area despite chests on these ignite waders is about minus 40 with the windchill he said it layers we suck when they get cold you drop them in the snow sometimes takes know kind of keep therefore humping about 30 seconds it is very very cold out here the night letters they work great their carbon friendly no fuel and pretty much want to resist it they weren't really really well in other climates while you plug him into USB port and gate worth 100 percent whereas big liners they have a lot of fuel and you gotta throw them out so he's clutching the landfill or they can blow up in your pocket so that leaves it sit here Punk for 30 seconds and as you can see they're all covered in snow so I'm going to purposely leave the USB like you're back in the snow so let's take these extra cold now gloves on makes it difficult to light laterz anybody's ever dropped a layer in the snow knows that the don't light so that one doesn't wait that one don't like that window light even though those big lighters are cheap pennies two things to a letter I just threw eight three letters that don't work now that's ignite later you clearly see it's still covered in snow now hopefully this works and as you can see one shot pulling back it's a little bit cold so it's a little step but it's clearly on and you can still light your cigarette you came with a she could be great by late night lighters there's 20 years before and even though there are 10 to $15 apiece they're probably the best thing I just wasted three letters and this is the best so get one night lightens calm", "ferSWS8msCc": "this is Stephen coming back to you with another video slash review on the atomic lighter now this slider actually retails for somewhere around nineteen dollars and change it you can pick it up at a local Walmart it does have a USB connection here for charging purposes it does have on and off switch so you don't always have to leave it on to drain the battery so that is a plus I have used this a little bit to light different things up as you see if you hold down the button it will come off and on I think it lasts for about seven seconds and then it'll start fading out on you that just keeps you from burning up of the lines in here and overheating I have used it trying to burn paracord and as you see I've got a piece here that's somewhat frayed so just kind of want to give you the demonstration of what it would be like to have to burn this down and as you can see it actually takes a while to get this paracord burned down and it is taking way longer then then it should with a Bic lighter now this lighter actually purchased at a local auction sale for around five dollars the the price of it again is around nineteen dollars I managed to pick it up as a deal for five bucks for five dollars I don't think I got hurt too bad but if I would have had to pay the twenty I would have probably regretted the fact that I wasted my money on twenty dollars you can buy an awful lot of bit gliders for that and even if they do wear out you can still get them replaced relatively cheap so if I'm going to call this thing a deal or a done I don't definitely call this a dud for 20 bucks Zippo lighters about twenty dollars and you can constantly refill it also again a Bic lighter it's hard to go wrong and Plus this lighter here is about seven dollars and if you need to melt something with paracord or whatever striking a fire in the woods getting a quick heat source going if you're cold you can't go wrong with that I mean that right there is about $7.99 or something like that even at a local gas station and again it's refillable too and that's a long way from 20 bucks and you got twice the lighter here in my opinion this right here definitely is a dud I wouldn't waste my money or my time on it honestly the metal that they use feels relatively cheap it just say it's a high grade metal but it feels super cheap to me Zippo lighters actually have a way better feel than this does it's it is kind of heavy but not not as heavy and durable is a Zippo and this has definitely got a kind of a weak spring feel to it in the flip up and it wouldn't take a whole lot I don't think to to make it not work anymore so that's just my opinion my two cents I hope that helps you out out there please make sure to

Hi guys welcome to text and office. Though the channel is about technology and\noffers, I have come here to show you awesome video about the collection of lighters I own\nfor that I am a non smoker but I am really passionate about collecting lighters so let's\nsee the first one is a Zippo it has a drawing of an eagle and little bit description of\neagle this one is Matt black and made in China and it doesn't work right now it has a small\ntext on it and next one is a lighter which is shape of Fire extinguisher and this one\nhas a TorJet with flame and the fuel which is used in it is called Nafta. the naftha fuel is more flammable and faster\nthan normal butane gas. next one is a double barrel gun nice shape\nand this nice wooden kind of texture and Steel body with the Steel kind of Trigger this is\nthe lighting button you can see the light coming from it yeah you can see the the light\ncoming through this yeah this one is not working here you can feel the gas in it and next one\nis a normal kind of lighter but this one has dice in it you can see it right and it has\na text written love and symbol of love it is also a wind flame lighter you can see you\ncan see their Wings am coming through it next one is a normal kind of lighter but it's width\nis more and its flame is normal frame next one is kind of a Majestic look at nice executive\nstyle and it also has wind flame lighter you can see right and this also seems like a normal\nlighter but it has a cold shape and nice finish on it and the one is actually kind of a logo\nof Transformers movie Optimus Prime this one also is a wind flame lighter. Yeah let me increase the Fuel yeah nice flame. Next one is a sword shape lighter it has a\nmonster face on both sides and and Dragon face shape engraving on one Dragon and an\neagle on other side this on also is a wind flame lighter. doesn't work right now and this one is my\nfavorite and it has nice wood texture finish and it has a Granite and marble in it and\ningredients of two Snakes and a fish, bird. This one is really nice but it has normal\nflame and. this one is similar to this kind of Fire extinguisher and this one actually\nworks and it has a torget flame sorry it's little bit low I think yeah its working you\ncan see its speed right ok i think its almost over and the one is a Titanium body made by\nClipper company it has nice finish because I told you it's Titanium normal flame and\nnext one is a zippo it also doesn't work and nice Steel finish and here its written Zippo\nand this one is also a Zippo kind of lighter in doesn't have flame. its wind flame lighter and it has a nice leather\nfinish and steel and next one is a gun shaped lighter and this one is the lighter Trigger\nand it is a double flame lighter doesn't work and this one has there is two LED bulbs on\nit but the battery is down and because of that it's not working and it's pretty old\nthat's why most parts has got rusty and this one also is a normal kind of lighter but it\nhas a opening like a zippo it also has wind flame it doesn't work and you can see all\nthe inner mechanism of this lighter its pretty cool and this one is a old rusty lighter it\nhad a golden finish on it and this one is kind of a Zippo kind because it also has thread\nin it and I also don't know much about its mechanism and all\nthere is something you can do with it I think you can insert the thread in it and this is\nfrom Vienna Austria and tje next one is a normal kind of Bic lighter this is disposable\nlighter name GIANT written on it, normal flame why are included this in all this lighter's\nis that we cannot live without this kind of lighter even though we have all such lighter's. this one is a jeans pant lighter tis like\nits put on a mould and this is actually has cloth it's actually jeans and you can adjustits\nflame and you can fill fuel here. It got damaged that's why it doesn't work. this one is a torget lighter it doesn't work\nL&M written on both sides. And there used to be a cover on it got damaged\nand this one is a revolver shaped lighter and this one is the trigger of a the lighter\nthat doesn't work and yeah from here the flame comes here you can adjust the flame and you\ncan inject fuel through this. And this is kind of a handgun short one and\nthis one also doesn't work, here you can adjust the frame and you can inject that fuel through\nthis kind of cool lighter but it doesn't work and this one is a golden colour lighter and\nit has a logo of Audi on it and a monkey holding some kind of fruit it's written Run quickly\nyeah and here you can fill the gas and if you want to put the gas out you can adjust\nit with a screwdriver this one also is a normal kind Zippo kind of lighter and another one\nis a similar to this one so I don't think I need much to explain about it it has a Eiffel\ntower on it and the sun is a normal lighter but smaller than other writers and the flame\nis it pretty huge on this and yeah this one also a similar to that and this one is a Apple\nshaped lighter Apple logo you can see a part of it is bitten and this one is a normal flame\nlighter but it doesn't work but it's really cool to carry this around because it gives\nyou an executive kind of look see the colour and finish also is good which made in China\nand next one is Jaguar face lighter the flame comes from here and here this is the trigger\nand this one is to carry it like a key chain or some and its a normal kind of lighter here\nyou can adjust flame and even you can fill fuel through this one, this one also is made\nin China nice finish lighter. so I believe that you have enjoyed this

friends family newcomers this is Bridget Earl is it going to be a review on big lighters I got the regular bit classic and then I got this big slim flick this is great for women on the go that I wanted to a quick one in your purse this one retails for only a dollar and it's really good you can buy them at the Dollar Tree environment Dollar General Walmart any of your local retails just keep away from children a night lighter away from face and children never expose it to heat above 50 Celsius never puncture or put in fire be sure the flame is completely out before each use do not keep lit for more than 30 seconds because letter overheats and will blow up this lighter is not childproof there is new sustain for their property proper use adult supervision if you are satisfied with this performance of this you can write them online at BIC I just want to show you how good their products are these ones retail for three dollars almost and this is what they look like when they're lit really nice easy flick as you guys can see with these classic lighters they light on the first try again these retail for $2 to $3 at my stores where I buy them this pick flick is really tiny it's easy to use on the travel and put in your doomsday bags you can put in your first aid for your car if you're a smoker they work really great I recommend this small pick one just and it's called this slim flick these are nice to use for like candles lighting multiple times if you smoke these ones are just good if you're like average smoker or a social smoker or you want to use it to light a candle I would highly recommend these like I said the slim fit is a dollar and the other two that I show here or a dollar ninety-nine two dollars depends on the design and where you buy them they can range all the way up to three so give them a try", "P3uYXg6inAQ": "what's up YouTube some a bit later died kind of sad but still mixed with sparks and it's wondering I wonder if those sparks are enough to start a fire up to themselves you know so even if the lighter runs out of juice maybe I can still use it as a fire tool I took the cap off I took the safety off in the insole guard around the flame a nice bar sits kicking off so let's see what happens get some cotton right here ripped up cotton ball BAM so there it is guys even I mean there's no accelerant on that at all just a cotton ball so even with just a plain cotton ball you can easily you rip it up a little bit you usually start a fire with a bit lighter even if it's dead so I think spike nesters", "QfeKKZE9F8Y": "hello and welcome to the black cat bushcraft Channel today I wanted to have a brief discussion and share a couple of tips on what is probably one of the most utilized forms of fire-making on the planet and that is the big lighter alright so the first tip is when you go to purchase your lighter pick out something that's a bright color that'll contrast with the natural environment this is something that's been stated over and over again but it's worth repeating once more if you take a brown or black colored lighter or even a dull green color lighter into the woods and you drop it chances are it's going to be hard to spot it especially at a little bit of a distance but if you take something like this safety orange color or something that's a neon green or even a red those colors are gonna contrast in a natural environment and gonna be a lot easier for you to spot even it a little bit of a distance so pick out something that's bright and that will catch your eye should you drop it so can you spot my lighter even in its low-light condition it still stands out in his environment alright so the next thing I wanted to show you was this one-inch Gorilla Tape that I've wrapped around the base of my lighter and this is probably maybe a foot and a half maybe two foot of tape the tape itself is attaching a small stretch of number 36 Bank line the nice thing about that is it gives you a strong attachment point for your lighter and on a daily basis I'll wear jeans a lot of times and your jeans have that little slip watch pocket right in the front where the hip pocket is that pocket normally doesn't get used for anything but it makes a perfect place to carry a big lighter the only problem is once the lighter falls down in that pocket sometimes can be a little aggravating to get your fingers down there and fish it out but with this loop attached you just reach down there grabbed a loop and you can recover your lighter very easily the other thing is you can attach this to a cord and carry it around your neck so that when you're in your camp you don't lose your lighter you know exactly where it's at even in the dark you can also attach it to a carabiner attach it to zipper pulls and things like that on your pack so it just makes a great attachment point to secure the slider and it makes it a lot less likely that it'll get lost the other benefit to having that tape on your lighter is that serves as an emergency tinder source if you needed that you could just peel a little bit of that tape off kind of wadded up you've got open fire with your lighter so you can ignite that and it's impressive how long that tape will actually burn for so that extended burn time will give you the opportunity to ignite other materials to get your fire started so it's great to have that tinder already attached to your fire source all right so let's test out this gorilla tape and see how well it burns so I'm just going to peel some of it off and I added a little bit on here just for the demonstration so that way I didn't deplete my resource but with this guerrilla tape I mean you just rip just tear it up in a couple of strips like this and just kind of wad that stuff up here gives it a little extra surface area and as long as you've got open flame it's very easy to ignite and this stuff is amazing how long it will actually burn you just got to be careful not to get it stuck to your fingers and get yourself burned as it melts down the adhesive I believe is flammable in that and of course the material being like a plastic or rubber material it burns you can see that black smoke kind of reminds me of when rubber burns but anyhow this stuff makes an excellent tinder to get stuff started marginal materials natural materials whatever if it's damp wet this stuff it'll get it going take a look at my my phone it is exactly 4:13 right now let's see how long it lasts all right so it's for night ting on my phone literally I don't know if my phone screen will show up but it's 419 and it is still just a little bit burning a little bit there steel you can see all right so my little pizza duct tape just went out and it is literally 419 on my phone so we started at 413 and so six solid minutes of burn time with that 4-inch piece of duct tape that's pretty impressive and gives you an idea of how effective that stuff is as a tinder all right this next tip in my mind is about the most important thing that I'm showing you for years I've carried a Bic lighter and my biggest fear has always been that what if when this lighter is in my pocket this switch will get pressed and all the fluid will come out or if I'm carrying it in my pack and something bumps up against it and applies pressure in my mind I'll have a lighter that's brand new or 3/4 full and then when it really counts and I need it I go to use it and all I get is sparks in the flame so that's kind of like my worst fear I'm gonna give credit to Dave Canterbury cuz I got this idea from him and actually a couple week or two back he was showing something I think it was on Facebook it may have been YouTube he was doing an experiment with a lighter and he didn't want there to be flames so he used a Canadian jam not with a short stretch of bank line to immobilize the fuel switch and basically all you do is you take that loop and hook it over the button or excuse me under the button and cinch it down once the Canadian jam knot cinches the only way to release it is to pull the opposite tag in so when you put it up there you know it's going to be very secure and you're absolutely getting no flame if I take that off just to show you I get flame right away but when I put this loop up there and cinch that down I'm getting no fluid lost there so even if this was in my pocket or in my kit and something pressed up against it I have no worries that I'm gonna lose my fluid unintentionally so I really like this idea it's a great great tip and I thought it was well worth repeating and passing on just in case you don't know how to tie a Canadian jam knot it's as simple as tying one overhand knot in the end of your cordage some people call that a pretzel knot because it looks like a pretzel now you take that same in with a knot in it and wrap it around the standing end of the cord and you simply tie another overhand knot here which essentially creates like a noose and when you cinch that tight that first stopper knot will work its way down and jam up against the second knot like this so this tag in loosens it and the other end will tighten it once it tightens it doesn't loosen on its own until you pull the tag one of the biggest criticisms of a big lighter is it doesn't work if it gets wet and I agree a hundred percent if you submerge a lighter when you go to pull it out and try to get flame it's not gonna work however that's a problem a complication that's easily overcome with the right technique so I wanted to demonstrate that for you you can see that I've got my lighter submerged in this cup full of water here you can see there is real water in there and it's the same lighter that I've been showing you it's been in there for several minutes now and then leave it in there a little longer just to make sure it's fully submerged and you know you think about it how's your lighter gonna get wet maybe it's in your pocket you get wet and so it gets wet in your pocket or maybe you drop it in watering you quickly recover it so it's just going to get a little damp so this should simulate the worst case scenario friend of mine Jaime box over at burning River brush craft he did a video on this recently and he showed a method for doing that and it's also taught at the Pathfinder school how to recover a wet lighter so I thought I'd demonstrate for you how I do that too just to show how easy it really is to get a wet lighter working once again alright so as you can see my lighter still submerged here I'm just gonna pull it out and it's been in there at least five minutes the first step is I'm just gonna start to shake the lighter try to just kind of shock any moisture that's inside and then in there just tap against my hand and part of that shaking is to every time I shake it I'm getting a breeze blowing across that the little Flint striker wheel plus the impact again is shaking the water out nice thing about this little paracord I mean a bank line Lupus gives me a place to hold from to do this this normally takes a couple of minutes [Applause] getting sparks now in just a little bit that's better than it was fair I'd get more sparks oh you see it had flame there it lit there we go so I know that took a couple of minutes however you can see fully submerged for over five minute lighter within a couple of minutes back to functioning alright so there you have a couple of little hacks for your Vic lighter if you keep that in your kit you know I definitely think it's worthwhile to keep these in your kit imagine if you were in a life-and-death situation possibly and you had to get a fire started right now would you reach for your Ferro rod or your flint and steel kit would you try to spin a bow-drill to get an ember would you just reach out and grab that lighter I'm sure that most of you would agree that grabbing that lighter would be the fastest and easiest method even if this lighter was submerged look at how fast you can drive that thing out and get that instant flame by the time you could go in your pack get out of flint and steel kit process a tinder bundle ignite char blow it into flame chances are you could dry this out and just have instant flame that you could use even easier and maybe even faster so just just a thought it doesn't mean that I'm not gonna still carry things like my Ferro rod which is always in my pocket or its practice flint and steel and solar ignition and bow drills because I love doing all of those things they're all great skills and could be life-saving skills it's just that if push came to shove and that's in my pocket that's gonna be my first go-to thank you for your time and interest I appreciate your support your kind comments and your views and I hope that you'll stick around they'll definitely be another video coming soon and until that one take care and God bless", "ixHEBXrMWhs": "hey guys it's got to cut here and I'm going to be showing you how to make like a Zippo out of your bic lighter as you might have seen in my last video I showed you how to increase the flame on your lighter and like I said this light is not working so I can't really show you so what you're going to need for the Zippo project is some type of pliers multi-tool or something you're going to grab on to the nozzle with just like if you're making the flame bigger and that's about it so what you're going to want to do is pop off the flame shield I lost the flame shield till I can't really show you guys but you're going to pop that off and you're going to reveal this little nozzle here and then you're going to want to get your pliers over there and grab onto that nozzle and turn it to the right because if you guys ever seen the lighters where it has adjustable flame height or flame yeah right on the front here you turn it to the right to make it bigger turn to the left to make it smaller so you're going to try to make it turn to the right to make the flame bigger and you just keep and turn on that turning that until this thing starts to get jammed up so you're going to click on the button and it's going to jam up it's going to go up and it's going to stay up and constantly release gas and then when you do that you just flick the flint wheel and it's going to light the gas and since it's jammed it's going to be constantly releasing it releasing the butane so it's going to be like a Zippo but sit down well not the downside but it's not really a downside but to turn it off you have to either get a hard surface and push on the nozzle so it goes down or you can just push up on the button so yeah I'm going to show I'm going to show you a demonstration right now I don't want to my phone's about to die but you know flick that see not holding the button and stay let because a little nozzle there's jammed up so to turn it off you're going to want to either push down on a hard surface it sets off when you hear that little click and turn it back on and the other way to turn it off is just push up on the button way easier than putting it on a hard surface well yeah that's it for now guys stay tuned for more videos coming in the future and please rate comment subscribe peace", "dIYtrRG9F70": "hey guys so you ever had a lighter and it ran out like this one you go to smoke your cigarette or your bong or whatever and you need one last sight no I show you how to get another light out of it so this part right here just little metal casing we're gonna pop that off if you just wanna stick a knife or something sharp in there so we can just pop that right on there so we have it exposed like so it's still not gonna work but if we hold down this red button here and then we go with our other thumb here and we slowly there very slowly oh sorry I forgot to tell you you gotta take that part off to see so again yeah hold this red button down and with our other thumb here we just flip this back very slow and look at that please comment rate and subscribe for more future videos thank you", "i3O7-CV1ECQ": "yo what up this is dirty so I got some new lighters today went to the gun show generally buy anything I bought that Nathan's knife kit but I wasn't really looking to buy I spent too much money but I seen these two lighters since I was a kid I loved knives and lighters and guns in all kinds of you know pyrotechnic kind of crap so I've seen these ladders they cracked me up so I actually got this one is for a gift for somebody and I just got this one for myself so this one is for my cousin he loves flipping people off and you know he has a lot of shirts with you know middle fingers and stuff so seeing the slider I thought about of him pretty cool little lighter I'm pretty sure this thing was supposed to light up at one time it says [ __ ] off it's a pretty cool little lighter and then this one looks like a little cannon and little wheels and everything this one's running short on fuel but let's see if it'll light on it so pretty cool little lighter said anyways just something real quick I got a bunch of other like gun ladders and stuff but they're all stored away and I actually a lot of them don't work so hopefully these will last a little bit longer but if not the main thing is they kind of look cool anyways this dirty shoots", "PpOFgwo8qbE": "hello everyone first we'd like to say thank you to all my subscribers because I have confidently hit 10,000 subscribers now as of yesterday sort of I didn't do anything straight away because you generally lose a couple of subscribers each day if you gain a few so you have to sort wait for it to be a bit concrete I'm not doing anything really special for it because it sort of you know long going thing getting subs it's not like you hit one amount and then you you know you're finished you don't do anything more so thanks to anyone who subscribes but you know I'm just going to carry on making content basically so a serious power or a Sarris power recommended one of these he's got a very interesting channel if you want to check it out I'll put a link in the description and his is also about field-sports and shooting in the UK so I'm check him out if you're interesting that sort of stuff and he said to me had I seen a metal Clippers before and I've looked at them but I'd never bought one and they're actually really nice and they're only about three or four quid for one they're well under a fiver so I'll show you one so it's metal by clipper and it comes in this sort of presentation box you don't really wanna keep it in this because the lid is a bit loose it's sort of not the easiest thing to get off but it doesn't sit you know really flush so you get the lighter in there in some foam so that looks quite nice and underneath there were some instructions but I just put them in the thing so it's got a nice weight to it so as you can see it's basically a standard clipper lighter but it's metal so there we go likes very easily probably a bit better than the plastic clippers which I prefer to Bicks anyway and it's very solidly put together it's obviously a bit heavy in a plastic clipper and I don't think these hold quite as much fuel do do to have in the thicker case but regardless they're very nice so what you've got this different from a normal clipper is on the bottom you have an adjustment dial and around the edges of it it's sort of got the sort of coined edge so you can adjust the flow with your sort of thumb or you could use a coin or a screwdriver to turn it more easily but you can turn it one way for a full flame and the other way for a smaller flame Sol a full flame it's like that the very nice big flame and if I turned it all the way to the other end you'd get a very small flame like that so I'd probably keep it roughly in the middle or sort of fully to the other way but I'll just zoom the camera out a bit so you can see this with the full flame sort of very nice looking very good solid like a very nice use of hexagonal circular wheel on there like a normal clipper but sort of much wider more similar to a bit nice gas release fun said very easy to do sort of flick it on and use it some people have complained of these the fuel doesn't last too long in them I haven't completely run it down yet so I don't know quite how long it lasts but I think it's just meant to be a nice or collectible piece for most people you'd probably just want the disposable plastic clipper I'll just show you it next to unloading get idea of size there you can see it next to the plastic Clippers and yet size-wise they are very similar the metal one is probably a little bit taller when you stand them both up it looks also a bit slimmer in a way so I said it has a bit less fuel in it but normal Clippers also like very well but obviously this has the adjustable flame which is nice the metal bit here on normal Clippers can be a bit wobbly on this one that's not the case at all that's on really solid and it's adjustable you'd still fill it with gas the same way from underneath but if you like clip alight as these are really nice we'll see it's nice to other good-looking metal lighter that you can refill with butane gas rather than like with a Zippo using fuel that evaporates over time because it's not pressurized so the only other thing to really say about this is I guess that yeah it's pretty impressive I like it how much shall use that I don't know but it's a nice little collectible thing and oh yeah the other thing I was going to mention which I forgot about is that this version which is like the sort of stainless steel sort of you'd steal looking one is apparently fine but some of the colored versions of it apparently can sort of it flakes off a bit like it's plated so just bear that in mind if you get one of the colored ones it might flake off but from what I've read this one always looks like this so I swim put a sort of gunmetal coloured one and I'm very happy of it so yeah the collectibles or metal clip lighter is very good if you want sort of a one nice clipper rather than lots of little plastic key ones", "V_ZHQXELO9Y": "somebody had probably spent a lifetime making this lie to feel good in

tested it out we've got warning labels here that'll peel off but quick easy to use definitely much easier so we're going to be testing this out on some candles and making sure i don't get burned but um it's a cute little lighter definitely better than the ones that you have to go you know you can burn yourself or hurt yourself so this is my easy reach ultimate lighter we're going to give it a try on some candles but i wanted to show y'all first i'm ready to sample my lighter i found a candle in my house we've got a little tea white i think it's called i forget so we're gonna see how easy it is to sample don't mind my coffee i just made some yummy coffee but all right let's try this definitely easy to reach and it was nice lighting it so that actually worked out really nicely so there we go so i'd say this pretty good lighter i do like it i'm used to using the really big long ones but they take up so much space and this actually works perfectly i'm curious to see how long it lasts but so

here okay that didn't work well as a problem anyway let's get this shooting this on a galaxy player by Samsung I'm smoking a reg Oreo Philippe Gregorio fusion and I bought a couple boxes because they're so good there's someone expensive I had a little mishap and it's happened twice so far last time was just a how about an hour ago and I had a lighter blow up on me one of those cheap disposables the first time it happened I had one of those lighters in the car on my dashboard on excessively hot day and when I came back after an hour or something like that I noticed that the thing had been shattered and there was a piece of it stuck in the headliner right above the driver's side and I actually had to pull it out with pliers it was that embedded a little piece of plastic acted like shrapnel frankly the second time just happened like I said about an hour ago a similar kind of a lighter and I'll show you what what it looks like and I'll tell you what happened here's the lighter in question as you can see it's just one of those 99 cent jobs yes sorry about the interruption anyway um this is the lighter in question and see can I get it in focus and I've never used this as a video camera before and anyway um that's what blew out actually two parts i was able to retrieve that one and the other one it was a tiny little piece that's missing I couldn't find it but it made a good little explosion what happened was was sitting on the counter here at my bar and it dropped oh I don't know a couple feet to the ground and then poof well actually is more like a pop so that was good a little um and it wasn't hot today or anything like that just some strange little mishap but I've decided now no more of these uh of these no name generic cheap lighters maybe like an by the mixer Gillette's or whatever who else makes it but no more of these because God can you imagine if I've been lighting that damn thing and it was near my my face for crying out loud anyway so just a little heads up guys be careful with these lighters it's a curiously enough this one is called a pop light and that's precisely what it did it popped anyway I'll talk to you guys later bye bye", "PKlHipdjvSA": "what's up YouTube so today I'm showing you how to make do a few lighter tricks so first one I'm going to show you how to make your flames from this big 20 freaking okay so this is how you do it so what you're going to want to do you didn't need one of the ones that have these things that push to the side so you're gonna want to have it on all the way low Oh window push it all the way up to high and lift it up bring your back put it back down and then just keep doing that over and over until you get the flam it's because you are yeah so that's the first trick I'm going to turn this back down to regular so I don't waste the fuel ok it's good so next trick is how to make like sparkler fire like Elm like sparklers type thing I don't know it's really cold so you want to sit there and just do this so much go like this system don't make the sparks but like just do this low be scribe and grind all the Flint down like this and it will start going on this part right here don't do it this way do it this way towards the button go for a little while and then put it on in between you in your pointer finger and your thumb just put it right in between there and then light up your lighter and snap above it hopefully those good on camera and so yeah that's the second trick um what else oh yeah then there's this trick were you so you're going to want to put your fingers as tight as you can so squeeze this finger really tight really tight really tight and then you'll have this whole head now just take us push the button don't spark it will just push the button for a little bit this spark it just can't do it I can't do it from the cabin but it looked really cool but remember don't burn yourself this so I've been practicing this for like a year know who all of these tricks so I'm pretty good at so don't get mad them you can't doing good but you're gonna get good book I can't show you guys this trick it's kind of hard and then what's another trip um why I guess it's not really that cool but so you can light a lighter and then put this one under and press the few jokes that's not really true let me think for a second so here's one you didn't need a pop so you didn't wanna in there I'm dude so take a lighter forgot okay so take your letter put it in there like this fill it up again like press this thing throw up and then just light it I don't know if you've seen that but you got to kind of go like this and light it so fill it up with gas light up side oh whoops it's just water in there that's almost coming out so then you just go tip it upside down and light it and like flame will come out pretty cool and then another thing that's cool was a light on how many is that so what's up mark from polar you can do hmm oh yeah I know how to make it so it'll be like a simple where you can just light it and we'll stay so you just see this thing just push it up really hard see it's cool right what so see that thing push up push up make sure it stays out oops see it's correct yeah that's about all I got for you guys today so like subscribe and comment below tell me which one is your favorite yeah I'm gonna be going to UM this store called

lights catch a cricket fire by Gillette", "2cNlFy5Frn4": "all right everybody I want to do a video on why don't think big lighters are actually that good simply because of the price of them and they're not refillable so go into that and why you know I'm not a big fan of them so with Bic lighter z' you've got two kind of types you they vary in size but you've got a standard sort of disposable bit lighter you know very simple design you know that it lights but it's not massive you can't feel all that you know keep all that much fuel in there and the main reason I don't like big lighters they're not refillable you can refill them by piercing that bit filling it with gas and then resealing it but that's quite a fiddly process and they're not designed to be reefs you know used and then you've got these pity electric dicks which I think better than those but they cost a bit more and again here's the issue not refillable easily not designed to be refilled so you've got those two kind of bits and the reason I think most people who've actually have thought about it like Clippers more is for the price of a few bits you can buy a few Clippers they're very similar in price but Clippers I also I prefer the mechanism on them and they hold a bit more fuel among these bits at least the smaller bits but the Clipper lighters are actually a refillable as you can see on the bottom there there's your refilling port they've got you know it's completely possible to refill a bit later sorry clipper but BICS you have to sort of mess about with it to be able to do it which I don't thinks is good you know that you've got that option so if you were just buying them as disposable lighters you could go for one of these which is like a much cheaper disposable lighter we get them over here in pound land or corner shops or ever and these are they don't like quite as well as Bix that's the only real difference but these lighters are about a pound four six of them whereas a Bic for a pound you'd only get one or two at most so even if the pick is a slightly better lighter of the two obviously this cheapo one here is better than the BIC in my opinion simply because you get more for the money and what I also find funny is for a similar price of buying a few bits you can actually buy more of these towards yet lighters which little jet lighters which are refillable apparently you can only refill them a few times before they stop working but that's at least you know more uses out of something that's roughly the same price for a better lighter because it's a jet lighter so if you're using it on a windy day you know you don't need to use as much fuel so let's for example show you if I had these two lighters see it doesn't easily go out but is the same thing of a pick um so the tour jets are much better in you know that for that reason they don't go out easily and you get that cool-looking red flame I guess they've treated it with some sort of you know chemical compound on there to give it that cooler complain but there we go so the other thing is I was with refillable lighters you can buy a big can of butane gas like this this isn't let you know refined butane it's not good for expensive lighters but for ones you don't really care about when they gums up and just chuck them away refillable butane this is a pound or two for a bottle of this size and this is quite a big capacity when it's 300 milliliters so this has 50ml free but we'll just assume that 300 milliliters is what you'd normally get for a pound you 2 pounds so for that you could obviously refill at one of these clipper lighters lots of times over if you can trace the size of the lighter to them if you can't know this camera here you can truck contrast a clipper to it you'd see you could fill that clipper up loads of times from one of these for not much money but for roughly the price of getting on these you could get a couple more picks and then you've only got a couple more refit you've got no refills essentially before these run out and that's the end of your lighter so although yes it is possible to refill a bit although you're not meant to if I was going to have to buy a disposable like I just go for these just simply because I'd get a lot more few for my money my wood verbs back even if the light isn't not quite as good you can at least do the flame crow a trick of these easier so you get that's obviously like the two types of things but yeah I say Clippers are much better than Bix for the simple reason of that the Clipper holds a bit more fuel on the bit and it's refillable there we go but as said physio electrics are the better fix but the problem is again they cost a bit more and you can refill them and for the price of these you could get tore Jets cheaper which are actually much cooler better lighters there we go what's better out of a clipper and a bit the Clipper easily", "_95EgiViwww": "how much lighter fluid is in my lighter inspect

without getting in trouble because like I can't do it the fire pit by the house okay do it in the fire pit down there by the trailer because well that's why the trailer and the bar and everything so if we make one up here it's the safest thing to do we're not really that safe so we had to do it in a safe place lighters they barely work lighters in the fire just to see what happens one at a time

I'm going to be reviewing the BIC disposable lighter as you can see here Vic has a lot of different colors and different kinds of designs I have a few here I have a red one gray white I have kind of like this funky multicolor design pattern there there's another one that has some kind of like green and white flowers on it and then I also have this BIC which is a BIC mini which is about 3/4 of the size of a regular BIC disposable lighter so I'm just trying to put it up against this red one just to give you an idea of kind of what the difference in size is but these are very very popular lighters I personally you'd like to use these when I'm working with paracord so when I'm melting the ends and trying to clean up the ends these are very very handy so I'll kind of show you how they work and in case you're not familiar it has a little rollerball on the top and if you also notice that in the middle I don't know if my camera's gonna focus on this but in the middle there's a child safety device as well so that's a really nice feature for parents if if you have young children and and if you you know forget to hide your lighter when you're done or put it away this helps prevent any kind of accidents that you know might happen of course you know we all could certainly be advised to be very careful with these ourselves and then especially if we have children and young children around - you know to make sure that you're putting away any sources of fire because you know again this generates fire is a very dangerous item but when used in a responsible manner they're they're great to have so - to operate a Bic lighter what you're doing and especially with the newer versions that have the this this new kind of childproof lock on the top you push down on the rollerball and you'll feel a little bit of a spring and there's a flint underneath the rollerball it's hard to see because the the rollerball and the the child protective lock is covering it up but you can definitely feel it there's like a little bit of a very slight shock absorber there you push down and you roll quickly and you hold down the button so that releases the butane gas inside of the lighter so this rollerball generates spark meets the the the gas that's coming out and then there you go you have a really nice flame that comes out the flame is about I'd say probably about an inch tall you know if like I was saying before when I like to use the big lighters with paracord you know just kind of with gravity you know if I want to do it at an angle as you can see the flame you have some control so the the flame is not too big or too tall where it's you know hard to manipulate or adjust it a lot of people who smoke cigarettes like to use bic lighters there's a lot of different reasons and they're small enough to just keep in your bag or in your pocket in your car so they're pretty convenient to have and they have a lot of different colors and also as you can see here as I mentioned before some different size a couple different sizes as well so this is the kind of regular size which is probably about would say maybe two and a half yeah maybe about two two and a half inches in length and then showing you again the BIC mini is about a little bit more than half the length in height of a regular-sized bic lighter you can find these bic lighters really anywhere grocery stores pharmacies convenience stores you'll often see them at the front registers of stores gas stations have them anywhere that cigarettes are sold or just I think just convenience stores in general usually carry these you can find them just as a single you can just pick one up and they also carry the bic lighters in packages as well I think this one actually I got in a package of four or five and you know you can certainly compare the prices from one store to another if there was maybe four this might have been a pack of four four maybe five dollars and fifty cents you know you can find them for you know a couple bucks at different places I think prices vary maybe just a little bit but I do want to just let everyone know please be careful when you're using anything that generates fire whether it's bic lighters or other kinds of lighters or matches or a mini blowtorch or just anything just be smart be careful do it slowly do it under safe conditions and you'll you should be fine and also you know if you're a young child a young person you know this video is definitely not encouraging minors to be playing with fire please do not play with fire if there's a young person that's seeing this video and you and you're wanting to try a letter please do it under Guardian your parents someone that you trust and someone that will help you use it in a safe way again these generate fire so just be very careful when using these and of course you know when you are using them that they're a great thing to have if you're using them in a responsible safe manner they're really it's a really great product you know we can go out and we can spend you know 40 50 60 even over $100 I've seen very very fancy lighters online and in specialty shops that can cost over $100 I actually do have a couple of them I I have I have a few Zippos I have another single torch flame lighter that I do plan on doing a review in the near future on so I'll show you that very soon but this is a really nice option you know there are only a couple bucks apiece you can get them in different colors different couple different sizes and it's a great thing to have very convenient so please when using any kinds of tools that generate fire please use in a safe manner and that pretty much concludes my review if you have any questions please feel free to post them on my video page any comments feel free to do the same and I will try to get back to you as soon as I can and thank you so much for watching", "RCmxpXUuJ44": "shows this might be another drive-in watching Super flick an enormous great food dog this flick is making me hungry it makes me want to flick my BIC we should have gone to the drive-in where we can eat and flick to our hearts content well what are we waiting for well come on man I'm going to have a pizza and popcorn and ice cream and I'm gonna have a burger with fries and a soft drink yeah great", "A0xcs2NGet0": "first press it quickly so there's a little bit gas coming out so I can blow it all blow it smoke yeah you just play with it and you'll get it all and then you can get a consistent you can see you can do multiple I think you should practice good enough blow a lot of old with the lighter a little bit man someone's gonna make a video holding two lighters time pretty easy okay let me know if you liked the video leave a comment subscribe for more", "lX0gUSTtIsA": "what is going on guys play my back bring you guys a brand new video and in today's video I'm going to be teaching you guys how to make your own custom bic lighter case these look pretty dope and I have all the flavors like what flavor you want you want you want regular dark stout rushing cream you got that honey berry Gotham bourbon you got the honey now it's dope about these is they come right out pop your new lighter back in and bam boom right out rushing cream boom but you get the idea you can pop your new lighter in and boom you're good to go you got you a nice little custom-made backwood lighter case so I'm gonna be teaching you guys how to make one for yourself it's actually not as hard as you think it's actually very simple all you're gonna need is your you'll need some scissors and if you're a kid you shouldn't be watching my videos first of all but your adult super shaky adult supervision you know I mean all right actually about that you're gonna need of course your back would wrap we're gonna be doing a Russian cream in this video got your Russian cream Bob Pat I suggest doing it with this one because it works better and I don't think they have any other one so and you're gonna need some clear tape and only you're only going to need two pieces of clear tape so it's not even that much don't trip it's only literally two pieces of tape no more than two pieces I promise you so enough talking about that we're actually gonna get right into this video after we take a nice rip off of our steamroller and we're gonna use our honey back wood lighter because we've got the hem down there hope you guys are smoking along with me give whatever you got get it out and let's smoke up and I'm gonna teach you guys how to make these backwoods lighters because they're pretty dope not gonna lie and shout outs of Ruby Mac actually got the idea from him from his snapchat so I thought I would teach you guys how to make it because it's actually very simple and we're gonna get right into the video after we take our so I hope you got enough don't you ever wake up in the morning thanks a blur I'm feeling so loose that I think I failed are we going to the top [ __ ] at UH motel won't go out we got our honey hemp weed slider alright so now we're gonna go right to the video that was a nice fruit and tasty hit actually I'm not gonna lie alright so the first step is you're gonna take your backward wrap and you're going to cut this extra piece a little tiny bit all right so I'm show you guys you're gonna want to cut right now right from the back alright so as you guys see we're pretty close to the edge that's what you want you don't want to cut nothing over here cuz that's perfect except you do that you're obviously not gonna need all this extra bottom piece so what we're gonna do is we're gonna cut straight across boom so after you got that we're going to get our lighter we're going to wrap it around make sure it's centered fold this piece back fold this piece back and after you fold both of these it should look like this so you see how you got your little you know your little line right there should look like that all right after you get it like this I'd you guys to see the line right there you're gonna get one piece of your clear tape and we're going to stick this down real quick make sure it's nice and tight all right as you guys see we're gonna stick it down the road quick just like that I then now you're almost done see you got your back would brush and cream boom if it's a little too high just push it boom perfect and we're gonna do next is as you guys can see we got this open bottom so we're gonna do is we're just gonna cut this until it fits perfectly inside the bottom alright as you guys can see I cut a little bit off and when you fold this bottom flat it should be able to fit right in there just like that so after you have that actually you're not gonna want to fold the front first you're gonna want to fold the back first so fold the back in just like that you're gonna crease these little corners make sure your case is perfectly even with the metal then fold crease and I'm gonna take it over here real quick and I'll show you guys you're gonna bend it down just like that you're gonna do the same thing to this side so I'm gonna do it so I can see what I'm doing after you fold them should look like that and then the only thing to do left is just to fold the last piece after you fold the last piece you grab your last piece of tape your second piece of tape put it right there on the on the cream part grab that little lip and fold it down boom you're done you got your Russian cream thick lighter case you could take it off boom slide your new lighter right back in and you're good to go it don't fall out it's actually really tight if you do it like this and it's pretty dope not gonna lie I have a whole bunch of them right here just chilling you know so it's not even that hard to make I hope you guys enjoyed this video smash like money if you guys enjoyed this video we're going to take a quick bond rip before we get out of here I am going to find my hem quick and light it you know yeah I hope you guys are smoking along with me and getting lifted kitchen how we do it over here we all get lifted even though this bomb big 30 but I hope you guys are staying lifted be positive because I seen this thing on Instagram I'm not sure so Instagram watching this thing you said if you had $86,000 and someone asked you for $10 you wouldn't care right well if you have 86,000 seconds in a day why should someone 10 seconds of negativity bring you down when you have 86 more thousand seconds to live in that day you know what I mean you feel me think about that and we're gonna hit this bong I hope you guys smoke along with me so don't what I mean by that don't let no one bring you down because at the end of the day just be positive smoke some weed so let's say oh by the river down below that's gonna be in this video I hope you guys enjoyed this video smash thumbs up let me know down in the comments below what you guys would like to see next thank you guys so much for watching stay blaze peace", "D6sXe1eMlFE": "all right there folks Doug back here with round two so we've got our little shavings that we still got down in here that I've got a little bit of a char on him from our last attempt and in full disclosure the last couple times I tried this it did take me more than one attempt to get this going for her for the sake of a video I was honestly hoping to do it in one but I think honestly it's probably good to see someone try and not get the first time so you just don't think that uh you know techniques like this or anything you know camping outdoorsman skills survival stuff it's not necessarily easy so anyways we're trying again I do believe sometimes that you know the time they tried it the little charred portions here I think might actually help catch more than that flame that happens in here a little char up so we're take a little dust or sprinkle it in here once more like we've done before try get a good pile right there and in fact I'm going to take the knife here is kind of make sure we get all the everything kind of loose on that I won't get anything we can because if we're using this technique then we're we're down to the last of our options so waste not want not in this situation alright so here we go round two let's try something off hopefully this one is success we can show you guys how this works all right there to actually lit it's on fires and cotton balls gonna stick over it you see the Cotton Bowl in trout on fire and in fact that plastic is still burning so you can use this by itself the plastic burns mount recommend burning plastic but if this was the last last resort you had you can see how that end of itself does well or if you had a tinder source you could put with it real quick you get that going to but there's still hope there was still a little flame like right down into there so I know I know like i said in the video before i do a lot of the fire start videos but i kind of feel like if you know you were out somewhere where you needed something you were stuck and or you were camping and something went wrong on you lighter you know didn't work or somehow the button was depressed was out of gas when you got it where you're getting it's just a little trick to show you know it's not always a done deal once the lighter itself is at a gas there's a few different things you could do with that by itself just to get yourself a fire for various things for signal reasons for warmth reasons psychological and you got something to cook you could cook it you can make a pine needle tea defense is kind of a thing obviously you know you got fire a lot of things don't want to mess with that so I feel far as an important one and again that's just one little one more little trick or tip to to keep in your bag there so thank you for watching folks all you need is one little pink letter apparently and a decent you know sharp knife to get that off and one last note there I did realize that with varying pressure you seem to get lighter or kind of heavier chunks and it doesn't seem to kind of kind of be like a little bit static you with the plastic too so you got to get good scrape a good bit of it and be kind of patient with it same thing with them the rolling out of other power just how i did it on top of there just put the pressure on roll the powder out after a while then you take the knife blade and just kind of scrape that down into you know the the crevice here i did the first go on this side and i finish on that side you know tap those back down together and make yourself somewhat of a funnel so obviously a little bit of papers in like this could be important to have but whatever your lighting it all if you have you had to do it on something like would just folk so I'm making sure you don't get that thing to spark and light it off too soon and in a situation like that you just gotta dude you can't so anyways folks thanks for watching dub starting off catch you on the next one",

up goes on goes on goes on", "iAzVzBXWDMw": "welcome back and to all my new viewers welcome to this town and today I'm going to teach you guys what navigation lights signify on airplanes and how you can make your own light for your RC airplane so first let's learn what all the lights England most airplanes have two types of lights ones which are constantly on and ones that flash known as strobe lights there are two give five saw blades and three Consulate's and some obsolete and this number may change depending on a plane first up on the left or portside wing is a concentrated light and on the right or starboard wing is a green light and towards the tail is a white light these are known as position or navigation lights which signify the left and right wing and the rear of the airplane to oncoming traffic other constant light include landing lights which help the pilot see the runway during takeoff and landing as well as lower lights which illuminate the airplanes logo on the vertical stabilizer now going into flashlights that are white strobe lights on each side of the wing and the tail on the top and bottom of the fuselage there are two red strobe lights which alert the ground stuff they angel is on that is a basic novel aid system on an airplane and now is the perfect time to subscribe to this channel I'm trying to reach 500 subscribers and I would really appreciate your help so with the basic idea of what nav lights mean we're gonna make a simple circuit so first let's talk parts first you'll need a set of resistors I recommend buying a resistor set as you can test the circuit with different values or decisions you'll also need a diode at 10 micro farad capacitor and a lady and most importantly the 5 v timer IC there is the brain of the circuit as well as some wires or jumper cables to make the circuit we first need to understand the circuit connections so before we sold it on a PCB we're going to connect the circuit on a breadboard so on a breadboard in the middle sections all the columns are connected and these are called the terminal strips and on the outer sections all the rows are connected and these are called the Busters so with that in mind let's connect the circuit first we're going to take the 5 5 timer IC and currently in a way in which small knot is facing towards your left hand side this is an 8-pin I see in which the pins are numbered 1 to 8 from the bottom in this I see pin number 1 is ground and pin number 8 is your BCC or voltage input that's pretty much all you need to know about this IC for this circuit next take some wire and connect pin number 1 that is your ground to the bus trip so that's going to be your ground input then we're gonna take another wire and connect pin numbers 4 & 8 on the AC similarly take one more wire and connect numbers 2 & 6 with that done we're going to start connecting the components so the first component is a diode so in this circuit the diode prevents the IC from Bernie when reversed polarize meaning when the battery is connected incorrectly the diode assists by acting as an open switch during reverse polarization so you should connect the cathode and that is signified by a y-strip pin number 8 while the other end goes to the bus trip on the breadboard then take your 10 micro farad capacitor and connect the possum terminal to pin number 2 and the negative to the bus trip now we're going to take the resistors these resistors determine the blink characteristics of the LED I go in-depth about that after we finish the connections so the first resistor r1 is going to be a high-value resistance here we're going to use a 2 22 kilo ohm and connect that to pin number 8 and 7 on the terminal strips the next resistor r2 is a 10 kilo ohm mid value resistor and connect that to pin number 7 and 6 resistor r3 the lowest is a hundred irresistable number 3 and to another column on the terminal strip then take an LED and connect the positive terminal to the bus trip and the negative to the resistor and connect your power supply it can be anywhere from 5 to 12 volts and there it is the light blinks but we're also going to add a constant light for that take another 100 resistor and connect that from pin one to another led in a similar way now let's talk about the resistors so resistor r1 determines the time duration between two successive blinks or highs in electronic terms so increasing the resistance will increase the time duration while the resistor r2 determines the time duration that the LED remains on during blink that is how long the LED will glow and resistor r3 only varies the brightness of the LED so I experimented with a few combinations and I found out that the most similar to a real airplane is when r1 is at 3 33 kilo ohms and 2 is 10 kilo ohms and r3 is 100 II this is just my preference if you like it faster you can change it just as I have mentioned earlier so that's the end of part 1 in which we've learned the navigation light system and understood the circuit and basically prototype it so in the next part we're going to take this prototype circuit throw it on a PCB board and so all other components then we're going to connect it to a receiver and test it on an airplane so click here to watch the next part don't forget to Like and subscribe comment if you have any doubts and I will answer them thank you for all your

other people do this I just got this as a gift in the mail and it still got the little child safety panel or safety thing on there and I've seen other people do this video and I'm just going to show you how I do it now other people use specialized tools and and basically I use a car key I haven't found anything better that works better than a car key so you just take the the pointy end here you put it up under here okay and then you use this the the back part of this shield here as leverage and you just grab it and instead of opening these little tabs to each on their own you just you pull up you stick the key behind this thing and you just use this leverage and pull up and then you pop it out from those little uh it's hard to do this to the viewfinder but you just use that thing to open up those little tabs then you take the meat of your your index finger you put it on there and you bring that back and the sentence bits open up like that you just wiggle it a couple of times and it comes out then you use the key to just lay those back down and it's really hard to do through the viewfinder but anyway there we go you use the key to lay that back down and then now you're good to go now you don't have to deal with that little thing anymore so I just wanted to put my little two cents on it out you know I don't use anything like i said but a car key I pi use the back of this little this little thing this part here that lays down in here I use that to just pry up the little tabs i use the meat of my finger to get down in there and pull it back and then you wiggle it out and then you're good to go so i just want to throw my two cents in everybody take her easy", "77-aXK40biU": "hey world's greatest review here look at this it's a little bit glider i like it don't forget to like share and subscribe and leave a comment about an item you'd like me to review next", "aFxJ8CUavsM": "well I can see it as being a very controversial video and everybody slamming the dislikes but I personally think that clipper lighters are much better than bit lighters and I'm going to explain the reasons why now everybody seems to like even one or two of these lighters you can't seem to like IVA and don't get me wrong I do like the bit lighters that the Clippers are simply a better lighter so I'm going to go into the reasons why and then you can feel free to disagree but if you do disagree please leave me a good reason in the comments don't just say I hit you in your opinion you're wrong right so what we have here is the standard cheap clipper lighter and then the standard cheaper so a little bit lighter these come in two sizes you can get the slightly bigger ones but let's go into the reasons why I like the clipper more so firstly the retail price of these although the bits are slightly cheaper a pack of five disposable bits or instant isn't much cheaper than pack of refillable Clippers so if you're their disposable lighters I'd like them to be a lot cheaper because obviously once you've used a gas that comes with the clipper lighters you can very cheaply refill them and you can keep them lasting longer and longer and longer so let's look at some of the features of lighters I said bits are not refillable there's a cap there but it's sealed in the factory there is ways of refilling them but you're basically modifying the lighter to do it they're not meant to be refillable limit to be disposable Clippers on the other hand as you can see at the bottom that red bit up so you refill it with standard butane gas it's very cheap to buy a can of butane gas probably one or two dollars or pounds or a big can of butane and you can refill the light as hundreds of times with a bottle that size so click the wins on being refillable for a very similar price to the bits the striking the clicker one is absolutely fine a lot of people complain about these hexagonal wheels and while I do prefer the round wheels that are on the more expensive clipper lighters the hexagonal wheel is absolutely fine to actually catch and light easily the Bix have this round we order this weird little cover on it I'm actually sure the point of that cover is because it gets in the way the wheel again they light very efficiently but however I'm not a massive fan of it the other thing I don't really like about the Bix is there's no fuel adjustment on it I think some models a bit cabinet but not there are two types of ick I've got at home now with the Clipper while there's no fuel adjustment lever on one of the cheap Clippers what you can do is once the lighters lit when you turn it that way the size of the flame increases and that's designed so when you're lighting a pipe with a downwards action you get a bigger flame the other interesting thing is the size of them obviously as I said you can get bigger bit so that's not a complaint about this smaller bit that the Clipper is designed so that you can pack a pipe with the bottom of it like that like using a pipe tool and that's something you can't do a bit because it's just a normal lighter shape so the Clipper wins on versatility the other interesting thing with the Clipper is if you pull out the Flint it's awkward there's a light as hot there we go you can use this as a packing tool for cigarettes with the end of this and you can use the sort of Flint for sparks separate from the actual lighter itself probably not that visible on the video but there we go if you needed it for a survival reason you can take that out and you can swap these or remove the Flint either way if you wanted to use it again to refill it something can't leave the BIC again I do understand that the BIC is meant to be a disposable lighter but because the prices are so similar it seems you get a lot more for your money with a clipper I've said as well as packing a pipe for the bottom bit supposedly you can shove it in the top of a bottle and it keeps insects out of the bottle if you're drinking outside in the summer which I don't know if it's an intended feature but it's quite a useful thing people have told me about so that's my main reasons for liking the Clipper more than the BIC what I'd like BIC to do because clipper have done it is to release a slightly more expensive refillable model I said the normal cheap Clippers are refillable but you've got these nice metal Clippers that are also refillable these are only about 4 or 5 pounds each metal casing at the bottom there you can adjust the flame height and this one has nice round wheel easier to strike and lighter on the phone and I've got it set for a nice big flame on that to go so if you disagree that the bic is a better lighter than the clipper or so you think the bic is a better lighting the clipper unlike me that i'm saying it the other way around leave a comment explaining why don't get angry actually explain your reasons if you've got good reasons i'll consider them but most people just try to insult me saying the BIC is better than the Clipper now one of the great things about Bix is because they're designed to be disposable lighters and they're not that expensive you can buy a few packs of them store them in different places as sort of not really an EDC lighter but you know in different places so if you need a lighter you've always got one time somewhere like one in the car glovebox winning a cupboard in your house one there some candles or something like that so that is a good feature out the BIC because Bix I will agree a much better than cheaper lighters because for example in dollar stores and in Poland in the UK even buy packs about five to ten very cheap disposable lighters however they don't hold much fuel compared to a BIC and often they don't strike they've got very very bad Flint and the flames are often very good and it's some really cute kind of butane or fuel because it always smells absolutely horrible when you like them so there we go Vic's are definitely better than the other brands of disposable lighters but for the price they cost I personally think the Clippers are a lot better value for money especially because they're refillable you", "sGFs4NYDeK4": "hey what's

we will end up with quite a few lighters some a bolt for us as presence let me buy for ourselves now when you're a smoker a lot of people say are what do we buy and generally the answers would buy them a bit like that I might let normally because they're brilliant gift and they're always a useful thing to have then then there's always the ever-present lighters I think every pipe smoke ahead while smoker that's the BIC now cut out the mini bit as well can't see that quiet offer then go there's a couple of mini Big Sur then a couple years ago I discovered these light metal covers for them bic lighters called the beam I'll go to her then now Richie travel about you often see other lawyers do quite like the look of like these Austrian life is here they are made by in co from about just after the first world war until quite recently and I really do like an in co lighter then then you end up with if you get like that I prefer to guess ones to Lee petrol for my look for my cigars linds occasionally when I'm out I may need a gas lighter unlike in the cigar if I forgotten one of my lighters so I buyer at clipper because they're cheap ready of it readily available and easiest ones so I've got quite a few of them but you can see I'm piling them on here now occasionally when you do go out I will forget my lighter and I'll buy disposable when know why it's handy thing a disposable if you like me in the steps or mind that they tend to get after a while get forgotten about left in the drawer with all the other lighters when they tend to build up like this and you end up with quite a few there's another way of bits in the metal case now what I think I've got for you too many lawyers and then I realize hang on that's not all my lies well I have these as well I don't think i'll be
