{"kxPDtpbK-Q8": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to the duke grows on today's episode i'm super excited to show my first run and my 4x8 tent in my new house so everything that you guys might have seen in the past was at my old house and in this house i decided i'm going to do four by eight tents everywhere and i have some other size tents as well but this is all from clone all basically i'm going to show you from the cloning process all the way to the final yield so yeah hang out and let's take a look so i wanted to show you before we get started kind of what i'm doing here with the setup i have my fans i have uh the intake fans the outtake fans the carbon filter i have a spider farmer 4000 light on one side and an hlg v2r spec light on the other side so yeah it's pretty nice everything is nice and clean right now on my first run um you see there that little intake fan with a little cloth kind of over it i don't really feel like i need a carbon filter fan going in but i do want some kind of little covering so stuff doesn't really get in too much but yeah that's uh pretty much the setup for this tent for this run i was taking a bunch of clones off of this blue dream hybrid plant it's called blue hash or blue hatcheson it really is similar to a blue dream so i've been really happy with the results on this in the past if you guys have seen a handful of my videos you've probably seen this strain pop in and out but yeah i had this uh this mother that needed a bunch of defoliation anyway so i took a bunch of clones from this um the real way to just do clones if anybody wants to see how to do cloning i am not an expert at this honestly i failed this way too often but basically try to get like four nodes down and then do like a 45 degree angle cut and then put them into these rock wool cubes you can also also put them into a root hormone first which i uh do and then put those into those rock ball cubes and after about seven to fourteen days you'll see roots starting to pop out of these things they won't do anything for like a week to 10 days and then you'll start seeing the roots just start exploding out of them and from the rockwool cubes i just put them right into a solo cup once they start rooting i should say then i put them right into a solo cup and let them veg for a little bit before i transplant into a final five gallon [Music] pot [Music] from here really all i'm doing is just watering i'm using this little two gallon hand pump sprayer thing which is pretty pretty soft so it doesn't like disturb the plants too much well yeah they they really do like a lot of water with if you transplant with a heavy root structure already they really kind of transpire quite a bit so you can soak them pretty good and uh it's definitely important to keep the humidity pretty high i like to use a humidity dome to make sure the humidity stays like 80 90 percent and then yeah i mean keep them keep them wet keep them uh water them every day if you can every two days is probably fine if you if you have the humidity high enough yeah they'll start exploding [Music] so from here i just let them veg out for a little while in the solo cups i could have transplanted them into the final five gallon pots a little earlier but i just didn't i mean they got in there pretty quick anyway but um after that i just ended up topping them all when they kind of have about five or six nodes i would top them and that will let them bush out a little bit more if you want to learn more about topping there's other videos out there for i think i have one on that as well but uh yeah it's pretty simple stuff that's about all i really did for these things and then yeah letting them go from there [Music] as far as watering goes i would do water on monday with nutrients i'd water with nutrients on wednesday and i would only give it water on friday and then i wouldn't water again until the next monday so basically three days a week i would water i think i didn't ever really super soak the medium either i think that's a different way of going about it you could maybe water just monday and just friday give it like three days four days rest between but i didn't really really soak the medium i just kind of gave it about you know one pitcher of water about a half gallon of water on each of those days and sometimes on friday when it was just water i might give them like a pitcher and a half [Music] the nutrients that i used for this whole run were the general hydroponics three-part series i would uh just take these nutrients put it right into my five gallon bucket fill it with water and then hand water i ended up doing something a little different after that but i'll show you that later on in the video that being said this is actually the last time i'm going to be using general hydroponics i have not just not been happy with the bud density when it's all said and done and so i have been using nuke heads which uh they sent me some stuff for free a long time ago and i've actually really liked it so um the bud density that i used in the white widow uh was all nuke heads and that was like twice as dense as anything that i've gotten with the general hydroponics stuff so i'm going to be switching over entirely to nuke heads in my future grows however this one i wanted to use just general hydroponics and i have another 4x8 right behind this one which i'm using only new cut so i'm really excited for the side by side when it comes to that [Music] well we're cruising right along here and this tent is just getting filled out like crazy and i'm like i knew that i was probably going to be over planting a little bit in this tent but it's getting pretty pretty jungly in here so i did a big defoliation before flipping over into flour and i knew even after flipping them into flour this tent is going to be absolutely packed so you know i wasn't that sad about it i'm like i think it will be fine i'm just gonna have to really fight things like high humidity and mold and stay on top of my defoliation and maybe if i really pack out a tent like this i'm actually gonna have better results you know more plants more more yield that's not necessarily going to be the case though and uh you'll see why as this continues on it was really helpful though to defoliate every plant before flipping them into flower i give them pretty much a haircut at least a third of the way up the plant like pretty much choose the line everything below that gone so all that stuff doesn't really get enough light anyway and you're not gonna really gonna ever ever have anything that produces decently down there so that's the first thing i did before flip them into flower and as of this point they were looking pretty good [Music] from then i'm still just watering my normal schedule i put up this trellis net uh i knew these things now that they're in flowering are going to be growing right up into these nets into the lights so when you go into flowering from veg you can expect the plants to at least double in size sometimes triple in size as far as growing up growing height i also ran this uh exhale co2 bag try to increase the co2 levels in this tent not sure if it helped a lot or not but i know having higher co2 which it definitely did did have uh should increase your plant growth so yeah i'm going to continue doing that in the future too [Music] and from here they're just filling out like crazy you know you defoliate one week and the next week they just looks like he didn't do anything to him so i didn't defoliate here for a little while right now they're just growing up and up into these trellis nets they're not quite there yet but they're really close and uh yeah they're stretching out [Music] and in just three days they've stretched right up into it so pretty excited about this every time basically they start growing up and through the trellis net i just bend them over somewhere else put them through a different trellis net hole that's that's i'm going to do that as much as possible to try to maintain an even canopy well they're getting wild and at this point i'm like all right i think there's just so much foliage in here i gotta give it another good trim job so ended up taking all these plants out trimmed up a bunch of the undercarriage some more took a bunch of fan leaves off the top as well and uh yeah just trying to trying to fight the canopy to make sure that i give as much possible light coverage to all the bud sites that i can i'm always looking for ways to optimize things do things a little easier too so i ended up getting this like uh sump pump a little submersible pump and a 50 foot hose and a garden sprayer and i fill up this uh 20 gallon tub add my nutrients to it and then i just run the submersible pump right to my garden hose and then i can basically water all my tents with one hose and it's also an extended arm so i can like don't have to get way deep into the back of the plants and all that stuff you don't just reach back there and do it so that thing has been absolutely awesome like watering is one of the pain in the butts when it comes to this kind of stuff and something like this is just super easy i know i've talked before about like auto watering solutions which i'm not currently using i still think they're great and they have their uses but just with my setup i'm actually hand watering everything now but i made a lot easier on myself than filling five gallon buckets and hand watering everything just with a pot too so yeah i think that's a great solution if it's something that you guys struggle [Music] with for now just watching everything grow keeping uh things tucked in trying to keep the canopy as even as possible some of the plants are just growing a lot more than others there are a couple other plants in here outside of the blue blue dream so those are actually growing a little bit differently which i was i mean yeah it's something you gotta expect i guess but yeah tucking and tucking and super [Music] cropping [Music] you can really start seeing these flowers pack on quick though i was uh at this point in the grow i was like man i think this is going to be absolute fire it's like just blowing up and not much time at all so if they kept putting on weight like this i was like this is going to be a record harvest and um yeah we're super happy with what's what's going on [Music] also if you guys have watched a handful of these videos love it if you subscribe you can see a lot of these kind of videos coming up if this is the kind of stuff you like i'll be having a bunch more of these type of videos four by four auto runs two by four a three by three ten it's all coming up in the next month so yeah hit subscribe and uh you'll hit you'll see uh some more videos like this coming out soon and if you want to support me in any way any of the amazon affiliate links down below if you ever buy anything from amazon click one of those links first and uh it gives me a little kickback so it's always appreciated but a like and a comment is more than i could ever ask for definitely like you guys uh sticking with me and appreciate you a lot of people have asked how far away should you keep the light there's so many factors to that but the light itself is probably really dependent on it for these i try to not go closer than like 18 inches a lot of times some of the top buds that are growing up might be within a foot though so as long as they don't get light burned these things have been within six inches of these lights and get very minor light burn at most so yeah i don't know 18 inches a foot is about what i usually run [Music] well here's where start things start to get a little bit more interesting like not bad not great just something so i was leaving for a week in the middle of this grow didn't really know exactly what i was going to do i i had a buddy that was going to come over and water it but i was like hell maybe i can actually just really soak them and so i'm not too worried about that but then i was having high humidity issues this this tent was getting like 80 90 humidity at some points after watering and so i was like man this thing is just so full i'm not so sure that i can i trust i don't want to i don't want to leave these for seven days and come back to a big bold fest you know with high humidity in there and so i talked to a local hydroponic store owner who i'd get a bunch of my stuff through and uh he's super smart when it comes to growing and he's like dude just chop all the top butts right now like if the top buds are looking great and they're like only a week away from harvest anyway maybe two weeks harvest them a little early you won't be sad about it you're still gonna have some great big buds and then let the all the uh lower stuff finish up on its own after that and it's like that's genius i'll definitely do that so what i ended up doing was actually harvesting all of my top buds and i left everything else below that so this is what it looked like right before harvesting all the top buds they looked done to me i mean they were only about eight weeks maybe just over eight weeks some were right right then um but they looked finished they had like nice colors already coming through i didn't give them to two days of like darkness before i only gave them just a night before of darkness so that could have played a factor as well in how they finish up but they were still super frosty they looked really good and i'm just going to let the other lower stuff finish out from here and in about two more weeks i'll harvest all this well here's a lot of the top buds that i ended up taking and then um here is the rest of the plants after they got topped so let those things roll and hopefully all that lower stuff ends up getting a lot more light ends up dense enough a good bit more because that light lower stuff was not even worth touching at this point so definitely needed to give it some more time [Music] [Music] so i ended up having all this stuff dry uh while i was away i put it in this dry drying rack and i was going the next week and had this this drying for the week that i was gone so i felt pretty good about that and came back and yeah started trimming i did hand trim all of the top buds uh i was live streaming for man probably three or four days i was when i was pretty much hand trimming i would just go live and uh a lot of you guys would hop in and talk to me so that's really fun and um yeah i plan on doing that more i don't want to do more than just trimming but it's definitely easy to talk to you guys well there's only 15 15 people in there maybe um yeah it's a lot of fun so if you aren't subscribed subscribe so you can see when i go live if you ever want to chat i love doing that [Music] well back onto this lower stuff i'm really hoping these small buds start to take shape a little bit better and and really uh firm up so i think they're okay they're definitely very light and larfy so i'm not sure how much better they're gonna get because they have been shaded out a lot of this stuff has been shaded out not all of it there's still some pretty good sized buds on here but a lot of lower stuff i'm just hoping will turn into something usable but we'll see [Music] you can really see these fall colors starting to come through like crazy i have been giving them only water since probably week seven so yeah their nutrients are all used up and they're starting to just cannibalize themselves and uh yeah all these fall colors are looking really pretty [Music] well i actually really debated even telling you guys this i always try to be honest with everybody so i'm going to and there's going to be so many that hate me for it but i plan on doing a lot of production so this is a one-man operation this is just me and i needed to figure out some solution for trimming so i ended up getting this i i can remember what it's called some trimmer bowl um i will find it and i'll put it in the description below but i could do about five or six ounces an hour with this auto trimmer compared to maybe an ounce an hour to doing hand trimming and with all this little the larfey little buds and the um just small denser buds doing a wet trim with this thing it saves so much time did i get as good of a product as hand trimming no i don't think i did at all but if i'm doing i mean i can't be spending 40 hours every every week i'm just trimming either so anyway this is what i did for good or bad i actually don't think i'm going to use this again because it seemed to destroy a lot of the very small micro buds that being said i have some really high quality trim which i'm gonna use and maybe turn into bubble hash or just turn into oil and stuff like that so it's not like all is lost but uh i think the final yield actually did get kind of hit because a lot of the smaller buds just kind of got ate by this trimmer either way it is what it is a lot of people have been telling me i need to get this trim bag a a real-life friend of mine uses it and he swears by it and then i've had other you guys talk to me about the trim bag as well it's like 400 bucks for a piece of fabric you know whatever it's fine if it works it's worth the price but uh yeah i'm probably gonna give that a shot once i uh can afford it so yeah i'll i'll keep you up to date if i use some other kind of trimming method if you guys have any other way of trimming that might be cool and helpful and save time and not uh not ruin the bud love to hear from you guys as well [Music] all right so now to the good stuff for the people that skipped all the grow video because you just want to watch cool bud that's all finished here you go so ended up german all this stuff i have it kind of separated into my first batch of hand trimmed top buds and then all my other stuff which is drying in the rack from the auto trimmer [Music] did end up getting some really nice dried buds even off of the lower stuff so i didn't get all the biggest buds i just got the top bud so some of the smaller plants still had some really nice colas from the lower branches so yeah some of these looked really great as you can see here have my setup going and uh yeah just weighing everything up [Music] so when it's all said and done i had 13 ounces from the top buds so i have that all on the right side here and then on the left side i have all the smaller lower branch buds which were also right about 13 ounces so i got about half from the top and half from the bottom my um grams of total grams were 708 grams of dried bud and in trim a lot of that is pretty high quality trim i got a little over 850 grams of trim so gonna be doing a lot of stuff with that 700 and whatever grams of uh bud for this this size tent with this many watts is a bit of a disappointment i was hoping for about two pounds ended up getting just over one and a half and uh i mean my goal was really three pounds for this tent that being said it is what it is i am not going to be using those nutrients anymore i'm going to different nutrients i have the same plants going in a new 4x8 tent uh they are pretty much they're close to done two weeks probably they'll be getting harvested and i gave them a lot more space so they're taller they're fatter they're wider but there's also a lot more light penetration that gets all the way down and so it'll be a nice comparison to see like less plants in the same space just given more room to breathe is the like inner nodal difference something that makes a big difference because if they don't get enough light they're gonna be basically buds more spread out so you know it's all it's all process it's all just learning so i learned something i think maybe i don't know hopefully you guys did if not hopefully you enjoyed it yeah i think that is about it for now i do have a bunch of stuff coming up i am going to be talking a little bit more about my little three plant autoflower grow with the mars hydro ts 3000 and um i have my giveaway which is next week on the giveaway video i think is my last video if you guys haven't done that sign up for a free light there's kind of going to be a neat little twist to that too so uh yes i know just all you have to do is comment on that video on that 3x3 video so look at my last video and uh throw a comment up on there and we're gonna have something fun with that next week yeah i think that's it for now oh yeah and then i have a three by three granddaddy purple four plant tent that's almost done too so yeah there's there's all sorts of stuff coming up anyways hopefully you guys enjoyed it till the next time you guys take care [Music]", "tlR98APSmXw": "hello friends it's me and today we are watching some sibling tick tocks tell me you have a younger sibling without telling me you have a younger sibling she locked the door

no this is all they could do and honestly this was me at a point whenever somebody would like pick me up put me somewhere i'd like to see you try to defend against this ow i kick my own foot [Music] wow bro whoa mattress versus baby brother who will win not today mattress he really kicked it out of the way bout to sacrifice his baby brother for a tick tock and was like no nobody messes with my brother sibling relationships are weird like you'll stab them for stealing one of your fries but like also give them a kidney if they needed it it's weird me getting bored and remembering i have a sister oh good old go to their room stare at them oh and of course the necessary leaving the door open on your way out excellent work you know it is an older sibling's responsibility to check up on the youngins at least three times a day starbucks for the youngest starbucks for the oldest oh they got a venti for the middle child close enough right now they ain't gonna know the difference why y'all not care about the middle child cause they're not the oldest they ain't special they're not the youngest they're not the baby justin yes oh and it was at that moment billy knew he messed up my guy with a perfect headshot he ain't gonna remember his childhood i swear the youngest child always gets better things growing up that is very true here's my 13th birthday cute right well anyways here's my little sister's 13th 13th birthday bro she 13. got the whole instagram wedding ceremony i didn't even get a cell phone until i was like in eighth grade until my friend started making fun of me like how do you not have a phone and i'm like oh no my parents didn't buy me one an accurate representation of what it's like to be home alone with your siblings and you hear the doorbell ring did mom say anybody was coming while she's gone no you hit the deck blinds got the whites here thanks no not the blinds like they're right outside we were home alone we always used to hide like there's a

doing get down you idiot somebody's at the door so awkward for the person outside like standing there like why did the blinds close the lights just turned off right in front of me what is it it's jacob's stupid friend oh yeah i forgot about that wow jacob's stupid friend like somebody at the door quick time to close up shop close the blinds turn the lights off meanwhile the person's standing at the door like clearly there's somebody home and they don't want to let me in but like this was terrifying post a picture of your sister and then the reason she is single is that what i think it is mayonnaise straight out of the jar oh at this point you don't even need to worry about a boyfriend when you're going straight to jail why y'all gotta watch the same thing i hate being the one that has to like hold the phone while we're watching something like put it down somewhere and then y'all could just like y'all i think my sister is a psychopath [Laughter] her like that this is why you gotta lock the door if i was doing this at my parents house and i didn't have a lock on my door i would have just like take my dresser press it against the door you gotta make sure nobody's gonna bust in when you're humiliating yourself on the internet everyone got that crazy sibling that plays video games all day he's the entire house out of food makes weird noises and has anger issues oh that was me though um yeah don't look at me like that that loser what you see me i'm the oldest i own this house i own you oh is it yours my now what are you gonna do what are you gonna do what you're stupid

for freedom and as you guys can probably see here in this video we are hanging out in the epic 4000 watt the record breaker or at least we hope it will break the all-time record that we set with blue dream a long time ago the last time that we grew blue dream but as you can tell guys in this video we are doing things a little bit differently with the dubbed audio actually still don't have my Panasonic camera with me I've left it over at the other spot because we are getting ready to make some videos from HQ but I am waiting for all the work to be done there first and we're still wrapping things up although a lot has been done and I'm really excited about what we're gonna be doing here with the new moneymaker 4k nursery but that is the subject point of the video let's talk about what's been going on here in the gardens so you see that we're running around basically just getting multiple Vantage's of the enormous buzz that we've been growing here the the blue huge strain has definitely not disappointed this time around the buds at all areas guys are just absolutely huge and I'm gonna try to get as close as I can in here with my 24 millimeter prime lens and I do apologize again for the the lens there's no image stabilization it's a geared lens I'm like trying to like frantically mechanically operate this thing but the shots actually got a pretty decent I'm actually trying to get a little more used to shooting with primes for up-and-coming projects so although I don't plan on doing on the handheld quite like this it still helps you know to become a little more adept at using them but yeah guys the Blue Dream is just doing great I'm pretty sure that at this point we are definitely going to you know exceed seven I think we should definitely be able to at least match the best that we had ever done before with this it I'd be somewhat surprised if we didn't quality factors though I think that this one could shape up to be one of the great only because the fact that just done such a great job of maintaining the the canopy quality you know the buds everywhere around are just getting access to such great light and the feeding has also been perfect no real complaints there at all whatsoever I think the only thing that I really wanted to complain about I think with how the plants you know not having to deal with the light you know light bulb going out at everybody but with the plants themselves we did or we have had plants that are consuming a lot more water than others so it is difficult you know to keep them on a unified watering but aside from that guys it has just been absolutely spectacular the the regimen that I use to vog you know obviously the every 16 basis combined with advanced and botanic here a little bit of GH additives you know basically the mixed I've talked about in previous videos it does incredibly well for blue dream and that's pretty much what I anticipated as well you know obviously with the SF EOG being as finicky as it is whatever really does well for that is obviously going to be really good for the blue dream which is a plant that just you know seems to probably it just does good on anything really you know I know a lot of other people that run different feed regimens that get similar results so this is just a really kick-ass strain one thing to that we're changing up here at the end is that we are starting flushing a little bit earlier I'd mentioned I think in my previous video that we didn't update from here that I wanted to try to sneak in one more full-strength feeding but that is just not gonna happen day 70 is gonna be I believe the second to last day of the month and that's what we plan to take these things and that's generally what always gets it done so with that being said I decided to instead start just flushing the plants that would give us about 11 or so days of flushing maybe a little more I lost the exact account but we are gonna be able to get at least I think three you know full-blown freshwater inches through these plants heavy floodings and remember the last reservoir that was fed the plants wasn't tapered down and we did not put any Spikers in that either so after we gave the the plants that really big full strength feeding with basically all the additives you know the highest ppm single feeding the next taper down or the you know the diluted reservoir had no additive Spikers and then we're leading these things right into the flush so definitely gonna do a good job of getting all the nutrients out whatever salt buildup sand accumulations that might be there they're gonna pretty much be gone and then the plant should ripen pretty well we should see a lot more yellowing in the leaves and they'll be ready to come down here guys in just a little bit so that is pretty much it guys for this video update next view update we will definitely be going over to over HQ to check out all the new stuff that you've been doing we have done some drastic changes to the setup it's been it's been the first time we've done stuff like this in a while so it's gonna be really exciting guys check out the new production facility and to see how many clones we can produce guys is in its pre massive you know as we build out pretty much the largest you know nursery open to the public and also Cal so thanks all for watching see you all next time [Music] you",

this [ __ ] thing man day 30 oh where does it 28th babe day 28 blue dream it's mother [ __ ] is going nuts I mean this is just this is one branch this has got one two three four five six seven eight

just wanted to give you a perspective of the size of this [ __ ] plant [Applause] she's a beast like I said you just can't really just light another [ __ ] it [ __ ] in my icebox in my videos this is my White Widow which is way bigger than that one Bush you're not quite as tall this is the 28th two buds aren't quite as impressive but so pretty killer well it's a shameful plain I just have enough room for my in my veg here's the cannabis chair which I think I'm gonna bring out and do it differently hold on so chest I mean you can see it's button see the areas on it I did what I needed to do to not get it to grow too big so it stayed inside here MA you look how long should I get shot inside can't [ __ ] tell but [ __ ] engineers on this [Applause] but like I said it's [ __ ] blue dream I got

some douche bag when he brought to me it had [ __ ] a fits every type of bug you could think I was spider mites if you go back on my videos you'll see when I first started this [ __ ] yeah we've been having some light exposure and I get in here just for a quick second be you also go back on my videos to check with that hydro plant I started on my first a second terrarium video I mean this thing's gone [ __ ] crazy that's also blue drained but see back in here me this room is packed it's probably 4x6 and then she's [ __ ] gone nuts but yeah just one to make a quick video on this [ __ ] blue dream like I said I saw I easily have two months left on this plant a month and a half not two months probably it said about 28 days in the bud I think is just going [ __ ] nuts I've got this feeding schedule down pretty good I got my pH but imperfect I test everything parts-per-million all beautiful I mean if you guys want any tips on how to grow I bought the box farm which I'm on doors but I use it Mike goes to and comes with a pamphlet I just put it on a poster so I can read through the potting soil just follow this [ __ ] man and you'll be growing [ __ ] mega earth so don't look at that how

really cool aquatic inhabitant and that is the blue dream shrimp neocaridina shrimp it is an awesome shrimp hope you enjoy the video appreciate you being here so welcome to our 40 gallon breeder this is one of the tanks that houses some of our blue dream shrimp in our fish room we actually have three tanks that house this particular species of shrimp because i think it's probably my favorite color of the neocaridina shrimp these are absolutely fantastic shrimp so let me tell you a little bit about them their size they're gonna get to max out around an inch or an inch and a half or so the females generally get a little bit larger show a little bit more color and so you have to be careful there when you're looking at shrimp especially later on when we talk about breeding them if you start removing shrimp that are less colorful sometimes you wind up removing some of the males and that may not be a good thing but more on that later temperament they're awesome they're really peaceful and so a lot of people like to keep shrimp in a tank that is a very peaceful tank you just have to make sure that you manage the tank mates properly and so this is one of the most common questions we get is what can i keep with my shrimp and the general rule of thumb is if the shrimp can fit in a fish's mouth most likely it will become fish food now what you're going to see throughout this video is while the adults can be an inch or an inch and a half the shrimplets are extremely tiny in fact when they are first born they are even very difficult to see and so that can make the tank mates a little bit interesting if you're interested in breeding shrimp i would highly highly recommend having a shrimp and maybe a shrimp and snail tank only if you're just looking to add them to a community setting then we need to make sure that our inhabitants are also very small by the way if you are looking for blue dream shrimp the place to go we have a channel sponsor flip aquatics flip aquatics.com i will put their information down in the description below but that would definitely be a great place to go to check out shrimp especially the blue dream they have a great line again they are a channel sponsor and have some really nice looking shrimp so what are some potentially good options tank mates for your shrimp mystery snails can work near right snails ramshorn snails those are all good options and snails and shrimp tend to complement each other fairly well in a tank if you're looking for fish you generally want to stay on the very small side so things like celestial pearl daniels rasboras can work things like chili rasboras exclamation point raspberries mirror raspberries you just want to make sure the raspberries you're getting are small that they're not going to really top out at much more than an inch and that's going to give you maximum shrimp survival other fish you might be able to keep your shrimp with the florida lease killi fish which is a very very tiny fish we've had some luck keeping our shrimp with bristlenose plecos although i suspect that some of the shrimplets go missing sometimes but for the most part that combination has worked out relatively well again the key here is you want to make sure the fish that you're buying can't eat the shrimp babies if you're interested in breeding them and so even things like endlers and certainly guppies those will usually prey on shrimp we get a question a lot about bettas i personally think mixing bettas and neocaridina shrimp is probably a bad idea just because the bettas are big enough where they can even potentially eat some of the juvenile shrimp that you might have in your tank now when it comes to the water parameters we've got a little bit of leeway here when it comes to the neocaridina temperatures you can go down to the mid 60s we actually keep our tanks in the upper 70s sometimes they even approach 80. their their best temperature is probably somewhere in the low 70s so let's just say 68 to maybe 74 but you can go a little bit lower a little bit higher what's going to happen as you increase the temperature of the tank their life cycle tends to speed up so they might not live as long certainly you're going to get faster shrimplet development but that's going to come at a cost of life expectancy when you're starting to approach those upper 70s and close to 80 degrees ph again we've got a pretty decent ph range somewhere around seven our fish room is right around a ph of eight or so and they're still breeding and thriving in that water but ideally you're probably looking at between seven and seven and a half water hardness fairly average with these guys somewhere between 5 to 10 degrees hardness on both your gh and cage should work out just fine you just want to make sure when you're adding shrimp ideally you want to add them to a cycle tank and that that tank has been established for a little while just so they have something to pick through maybe some biofilms have already formed maybe a little bit of algae is already present in the tank when it comes to food they're not particularly picky i have found them to be very good at eating green hair algae so if you have a tank with green hair algae certainly the neocaridina shrimp could potentially help with that but you do want to have you do want to feed them as well so they will eat uneaten food so if you've got other inhabitants in the tank so flake foods like we feed all of our fish northfin flake foods and micro pellets and we will actually put those foods in this tank as well for the shrimp shrimp specialty foods can be nice because they can add back some of the minerals that they need to form their exoskeletons so things like shrimp snowflakes or the shrimp lollies those can be really good they love rapashi that gel food especially the community blend and some of the algae-based blends can be really good for them every once in a while especially if you've got plecos in there we'll put in a piece of cucumber and we'll see them munching on that as well when it comes to tank size a 5 gallon is probably a good rule of thumb for a minimum tank size and the reason for that is the larger the tank you have the easier it's going to be to manage water parameters and so even with a 5 gallon in shrimp they don't like drastic changes in ph or water hardness or temperature so you really just want to make sure whatever tank you have you can manage the water parameters well and again five gallons and above but obviously if you go larger 10 20 gallons you're going to be better off again you're looking at a 40 gallon breeder here most of our shrimp breeding tanks don't go less than a 20 gallon so what should you put in your shrimp tank well you can see here we've got some live plants in this particular tank we've got some jungle val growing everywhere we have some hornwort we have a little bit of guppy grass in this tank as well probably some of the better plants to keep with your shrimp would be hornwort guppy grass maybe some water sprite or water wisteria these are plants that tend to grow fairly quickly they're easy to keep for the most part and the shrimp love that extra surface area to kind of pick on as you can see throughout this video and pick off the biofilms and the bacteria and things that are growing on those plants so that is always a great idea other ideas would be definitely sand with this particular type of shrimp the blue dream a darker sand might actually be better in terms of getting out that that darker coloration the downside to that is if you've got dark substrate with a dark shrimp you're not going to see them as easily sometimes and so this has worked out fine but sand i find when it comes to shrimp is a must not so much because they absolutely require it it's just when you're feeding shrimp if that food sinks into gravel it becomes very difficult to remove especially if you have a lot of shrimp and you're worried about sucking them up and you don't want to do a gravel vac what can often happen is you wind up with some detritus worms and that can cause some issues later on so i just find it's a much easier thing to do is to keep them on sand driftwood can be nice again it gives them a little bit of surface area to kind of pick through catapa leaves are great cholla wood is another great addition but that generally the way you see the tank here is pretty much the way we keep a lot of our shrimp tanks something else to consider when you are setting up your shrimp tank is filtration we run sponge filters in the vast majority of our shrimp tanks if you're going to be running a hang on back filter or a canister filter just make sure you have a pre-filter and intake sponge on that intake so that your shrimp and certainly the shrimplets don't get sucked up into the filter when it comes to breeding you just need a male and a female and as long as you've got the right water parameters typically they will do the rest it might take three or maybe three to five months in terms of from the time they're born till the time they're adults before they're going to start breeding but when they do you will see the females holding eggs under her body and we've seen that a couple times already throughout this video takes about three to four weeks for the eggs to hatch again the rate at which they will hatch depends upon the temperature if the temperatures are cooler it might take a little bit longer if the temperatures are running in the upper 70s it will take a shorter period of time again the shrimplets are absolutely tiny and so that's something to keep in mind they can even be difficult to see and so if you're doing tank maintenance you've got a gravel vac in there you're doing water changes just be careful because once your shrimp start to breed it's really easy to suck up those little tiny shrimplets there really isn't any parental care when it comes to shrimp having their little shrimplets the fry are really easy to care for because you can pretty much feed them what you would feed the adults and they will usually do just fine with that but these are fantastic

"[Music] what's going on guys and welcome back to another md fish tanks build video so behind me is my blue dream shrimp tank that i had set up for about a month now it is just a temporary setup so the plan was always to do a nice skate for them as well and we are now at a point where we can do that so let's crack right on with the build so one of the first things that i need to do is actually take everything out of the tank and put it into a bucket that includes the plants the soil the aqua soil you know even that leaf and that moss ball and including the filter i need to keep the sponge filter running so that it's basically everything there is now in a bucket that i don't have in front of me anyway that doesn't matter i'll get a bucket but let's just put it all in now [Music] click subscribe right there we go nice empty aquarium love it this is the exciting part so i've kept the soil down here in the bucket the sponge filter is ticking away there with the water that was in the aquarium and all the plants the shrimp are up here all doing absolutely fine they'll be fine in there whilst we're doing the build but the first thing i want to do is get some media in some bags these are the bags i'm talking about here so these are all made of plastic even the zips plastics there's no danger of any sort of you know rusting or anything like that i want to put lava rock and the aquasol in this bag the reason is i want to put sand in the aquarium like i want a different look so we haven't just got aquas all the time but i still want to keep the soil contained now i know that if i don't keep it contained and just put it underneath the sand the shrimp will get it out it'll come forward it'll get annoying increase maintenance time all that we don't want any of that so we're going to put it on the bags and just lay on the bottom first [Music] so yeah we've got crushed lava rock in this one we've got aqua soil in this one mix them together in the bags and then we're sorted [Music] so the reason for the media in the bags is for two reasons actually one it adds height to the back which means we don't have to use an absolute ton of sand to fill it out two it stops the sand compacting and three well there's three reasons all right three is extra sort of surface area for beneficial bacteria and this will just make the tank even more healthy because the filtration is only going to be one of these little sponges like you see in this tank and it's not huge surface area is it but we've created a ton more now and height and you know it's gonna work perfect but let's get our sand in and i've got quite a lot to choose from um i don't know i think i'm gonna go for more sort of a whiter sound so this hugo kamishi that's a quite good one i like that i think we'll go with that [Music] so that's quite a steep angle but that's going to give us sort of a depth look to the tank and also more substrate you better plant into as well because i want to actually plant it in some areas i want to keep it clean in the foreground and clear to be honest and i'll probably make a border so that it's like separate to the back and then have a nice little dish that we've got here you can see where you can't really see it because it's being surrounded by that hair grass but i've got like these cute little dishes that i can put in for the for the shrimp to feed in so i want to have that in the foreground but we'll just see hard skate wise i want to go for sirius stone [Music] yes we've got a nice good selection here i mean some of these bits are quite big but maybe we should just go for it i'm going to stick some in and see how it looks i might need to break some up or might not let's just have a go [Music] well that is quite bold but i really like it i did actually just shove it in there just to see you know roughly where if it would fit for size and then i just plunked it down a step back like now but look at that that uh that looks really good i don't want it on its own maybe another small one that way one that way and one that maybe i just you know a few smaller ones i'm not even sure yet i just keep going just keep going [Music] yeah i really like that so this rock is slightly different sort of color but not something i'm going to worry about it'll all get a sort of you know just dusting of algae anyway kind of like these rocks in here you can see they've all got that sort of greeny tone to them which i really like it looks awesome but the reason i've gone for the whiter substrate on this well it's an off-white if you like is because the blue dream shrimp were getting sort of darkened out on the dark substrate so i couldn't even see a lot of them um apparently they do go darker on darker substrate as well so now that i've got the light one they're gonna be like proper vibrant and blue now i've only put those three stones in there obviously and i want to do more than that because in nano tanks you can very quickly just start sort of putting way too much in and before you know it it can just look a bit of a mess but that's nice and simple i like that so we've got two going in one direction and then one in the opposite direction that's enough we don't need any more i want to put loads of different like plants in that all around this as well so it should look pretty cool i might build up that back area a little bit more though only because i don't want like dead zones behind there there will be some dead zones obviously but if i build up a little bit higher i'll also be able to see around there more actually can i see around anyway this way oh yeah i can see all the way around that's awesome okay yeah no need i'll just leave it as it is and it just gives more space then for the stem plants to grow but currently obviously there is no nutrients in this this gravel it's just or sand it's of course sand fine gravel there's no nutrients for any plants to grow so we need to put some root tabs in nice and simple just push it in under the gravel to as low as you can go wherever you're going to be putting plants now i don't know where i'm going to be putting plants so i'm just going to put it everywhere and just hope for the best [Music] well that's looking great i'm just going to fill up the water now and just get planted straight away like that i don't want to put loads of stems in that flop over i can't see how they're looking i want to fill it up and get planted straight away obviously i'll leave a little bit of a gap so that i can actually put my hands in without it all overflowing i don't usually do it this way but i just want to give it a go let's try another way and hopefully it'll look good straight away [Music] [Laughter] [Music] and you know what i might as well just put the filter in as well and just that way we know where it's going to be when we're planting and there'll be space for it [Music] right that's all bubbling away i let that all clear a bit because it's got a bit misty because i've disturbed it a little um but yeah we'll come back and plant it once it's clear it'll look better then don't know why i'm saying that because the second i put something in it's gonna create dust anyway it's okay it's okay so it is now the next day since we filled it up the water's crystal clear oh all the lights are coming on it's very early in the morning you see that you probably tell for my voice but yeah now looking at the tank i think i want to add some details to it just give it a bit more of a natural look so yeah look we've got some really nice clean lines the filter fits nicely working away purifying the water or making it look perfectly clean anyway but this foreground is a little bit too clean i do want it to be clear in the foreground like right there but maybe i'm going to add some detailed stones around all these rocks just some small pebbles that sort of have got got that grayish look and i can do that by selecting something from here one of these maybe we've got some delay sort of chippings and different different gravels and that i'll have a little look and then we'll put some in so in this bag down here i've actually got like a mix of a ton of old different pebbles and completely different sizes in here and i think that that will work really well yeah i'm gonna put it in so obviously the best thing would have been to have done this yesterday before i filled it up but you know you live and learn [Music] okay not my greatest of ideas but let me just i'll just do a quick water change with some dechlorinated water so we don't affect the filter remember the filter cycled so we don't want to just be putting chlorine-filled water in that will just destroy any beneficial beneficial bacteria that's colonized on it but also i want to be able to see what i'm doing so let's just get our water out put it back in again [Music] okay there we go yeah a little bit fuzzy but that's more sort of bubbles in the water than actual floating particles but that's absolutely fine it's going to get a bit stirred up as we plan anyway i don't know why i'm doing it but like this by the way but i just want to try something different so i can literally see how it's going to be straight away rather than you know planting and then filling up and being like oh that's all there and that's what you know i just want to try it this way just see so the first thing i want to do is start getting some of the foreground started before i move on again this is backwards and i'm going to start at the back and come forward but all the details are at the front here i really like how this has turned out actually to be honest looks so natural isn't it it looks like a little outcrop you'd find like near the beach or something oh beautiful [Music] so there's three of the plants that i want to use in sort of the foreground progesterone erectus now this is actually quite a tall plant but you can keep it short quite easily it doesn't grow massively fast especially with no co2 or anything or you know i'm not using massively high lighting either then we've got s weapons next to it i've always struggled with this plant but hopefully we can get some success in this tank and then this one at the end here pagostamin hal how fairy anyway that stays nice and small and it's all sort of like carpets a bit like uh s weapons when you trim it and then you can replant it and trim it and replant it and trim it and replant it and then you just cover the whole bottom so these are the um one two grow range from tropica basically there's no pest or anything like that in them and they're just like they're like baby versions of the plant if you like and i've always found that if you use the the one to grow in new setups they adapt really well sometimes potted plants can melt back and and that but these that never seem to for me so yeah give them a go plus their small size also means they're going to suit the escape really well [Music] and there we go just a little couple of hints of the s weapons and that's enough really because obviously a small skate before you know you're going to fill it up anyway so moving on now we're going to put the pagostemen hella fairy hello ferry yeah [Music] okay looking good looking good right next up we've got some liliopsis brazilian hem helianthum tenolum green i'm getting good at this so the reason i'm adding more is because these are sort of like finer uh shooty ones shootie plants if you like whereas these are more stumpy so i want to just mix it up a little bit get it in and amongst it just add a little bit more detail that's all [Music] yeah i've just realized now is actually a really good time to put the shrimp bowl in so just to make sure i don't cover up that space with any plants so the reason we put a bowl in is so that when we feed the shrimp we can see how much they've eaten and then we can remove what they haven't eaten very quickly and easily just with a turkey based dust so just put it in suck it out of that bowl job done if it's all in the substrate and falling in amongst it and implants and you're not going to catch it all are you but with this you can catch all of it which is why for instance in this tank look if you look down in that little one there's no food at all because i've sucked it all out and ready for the next feed and this is just because shrimp can be quite sensitive and you know water volume in this tank isn't a massive amount it's a really weird way of saying that there's not a lot of water in this tank so it can be quite easily fouled so we can just make sure basically we're taking out any waste but i think that's a really good amount for the foreground plants remember all this stuff's going to grow really quickly so i don't want to just fill it right out instantly and not have any progress to watch and now moving on to stem plants for the back of the tank again stem plants are really really good for small setups purifying the water when you haven't got a ton of you know filtration plants are nature's filter they work so good i mean all of my tanks are pretty much filtered nowadays but i could probably for instance with this tank here i could probably take out the this an awasee but if i took out that 250 it would probably be absolutely fine you might get a little bit of haze to the water but in terms of water chemistry it wouldn't be affected at all with the bio load that we've got in there which is these uh emma tetras which are thinking that i'm about to feed them and i'm not because it's very early still nighttime now we definitely need some red in this tank so if you come over to my better sorority tank over here look we've got some really really nice rotala hr which is just starting to get to the point now in height where it will soon be properly read from the light so the closer it goes to the to the surface or the light source the redder it will get just like these red root float as you can see on the surface here which are gorgeous hello hello ferella but yeah i'm going to do some trimming and take some of those again it means that these will grow more compact and more shoots every time you trim a stem plant two shoots come up so we're actually making it more [Music] so i was watching some aquascape tutorials on green aqua channel actually and one of the i think it was josh sim who said that if you've got something impactful it needs to sort of go on both sides so that's why i've added in the rotala hr that side and that side just a little hint of it and i think that'll look really good especially with the greenery that i'm going to have swooping over the background now if you notice in other tanks i've obviously got clumps of plants like that one and that one now they're all sort of held together at the bottom with a bit of um you know weight and filter floss so this one originally had some in there's some down here in the bucket and i just took one apart because i don't want to use the limb the feeler in this one because it's quite sort of but so i've taken out some of the rotalas now they're quite long so i'm gonna get them all to correct size it's a mix of rotala green and rotala rotundifolia and they're already so healthy and they just get the tank off to a flying start they've got beneficial bacteria all over them to help colonize the new new tank we'll be adding beneficial bacteria as well anyway so but yeah you always reuse old plants if they're healthy and good like look at that one like why would you not use that looks so good [Music] so there's the rotunda folio bunches in they're looped over slightly weird but that's just how they were in the other the tank previously they were obviously bent i don't know really but they'll straighten out it only takes like a day or two for them to straighten out and they'll be looking great but now that can't be it we need one more fine textured green for the background and i've got just the plant it is over here in the tank storage plant this is going to be a really cool escape at some point soon but for now it's holding plants for me a lot of plants as you can see but this is the one i want it's like ah what's it called home let me look it up milfoil that's what it's called so it grows crazy fast so i'm gonna have to keep up on it like because very quickly it can like triple in size in like a week but it's really really vibrantly green really nicely fine textured as well and you know just super easy plant i haven't actually seen it that often i've only seen it in the last few months and i just grabbed it and was like wow this is great why why don't we see this more often but yeah loving it so there's just one more thing i want to add before we're done and that's some floating plants i might take them out a later date but to start with it's going to be really good at keeping the nutrient levels down and just keeping a flood of algae away algae will build up like it does on this tank on the sides which is good that's what we want for the shrimp but it just stops all the rocks and the gravel the diatom all of that it will just help massively just to start with the flowing plants i'm gonna use are over here so in this this is like a sort of black watery sparkling grammy tank i've made hello fella look how good they look so sparkly that's what they call them sparkly grammys sparkly grammys no sparkling gouramis hello sparkly grammys anyway i am after the salvinia that's floating on the top there's not a huge amount there because i fished a load out and actually put them down in this bucket so i'm going to take them from there and then put them on the surface and there we go that's going to massively help to start with and they're cute little floating plants as well they don't get massive long sort of roots that go all the way deep into the water like frog bit that i've actually pulled that because it was so long whereas the salvinia it doesn't seem to do that it just keeps it sort of about that length we've got now to an inch yeah ideal right that's it i think we're ready to rock and roll and get the shrimp in their new tank so i've just transferred the shrimp over and they're now doing laps in this jug it's like the shrimp olympics anyway let's put them in that seemed to go really well everyone's sort of strolling around they already look good they look just look good oh love them love them so one of the things i need to do now that i didn't do last time when i did a re-skate was add beneficial bacteria you need to get it straight in i'm going to do it every single day for a week and i'm going to double the dose because why not [Music] [Applause] [Music] so another thing that i'm going to add in is some bacter ae this is basically something that creates a biofilm on everything the tiniest of little amounts goes in now and that should do the trick [Music] and there we go we're all set up ready to go i think it looks great it just needs time now to grow in i'm going to stay on top of the maintenance to trim in the replanting it's going to look absolutely fantastic in no time at all notice guys i also put the snails back in some people are like i hate snails always use snails in your tanks nails are amazing like don't worry about them like breeding too much the the population it sort of limits itself based on the amount of waste food that's available so if you don't over feed your tank you just won't get a ton so this tank had been set up for like two months if you notice i only had about six seven snails in there and they're ramsan snails and bladder snails which are renowned for breeding massively so just goes to show don't over feed and you won't get a like massive population increase in snails and then they can just carry on doing their job really well [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so you", "xsTfi029PUc": "[Music] women dream blue dream blue dream is absolutely everywhere it's a huge strain it's rare to walk into a dispensary and not see blue dream I mean I see it all over the place it seems one of the most popular strains out there virtually everybody likes that's a great strange period smoke hi everything blue dream is one of the most commercially successful strains in California it is like the McDonald's of marijuana back in 2004 when I was growing it with my business partners it was very new it looked different and so it's sold very very well my name is Beth and I'm one of the original growers of Blue Dream I made it popular I had just graduated college early and moved to San Francisco to work for a law firm and was hanging around with a couple like DJs who were very much into the nightlife scene one of my deejay friends like hey like I know of this after-party and it happened to be house and we met it was like fireworks like immediately became in love like it was just an instant connection that we had with one another and ever since been we kind of became inseparable and he told me that he was a freelancer he had like three or four little plans alight and I was like very cute and humble and I told him during that kind of like look don't fall in love with me because I'm moving to New York and I'm going to law school and he very concisely drafted a million dollar cash business plan that he presented to me in an excel sheet that said and this is how you're gonna make your first million dollars in cash honestly at 21 the idea of being hundreds of thousand dollars in debt and moving to New York versus traveling the world and doing it cash and tax free sounded pretty awesome it was really important that we were creating something that was visually beautiful and that it was packaged in a way that made it sexier and for me it was creating a brand story because the market was so flooded with so many other strains that were being grown outdoors I was what's cool about blue dream is that like the buds are so blue and crystally and they smell awesome because that was the only strand we were growing and we were flipping it every eight weeks we were able to tip the market because it was like what is this new strand where is it coming from and how that were able to get so much of it all the time I met the buyer that bought for 17 different locations in Southern California loved it he was like we're not getting this kind of stuff in Los Angeles this is going to fly off the racks in LA and because they were flooding the LA market with it we couldn't keep up with it which has been when we got our second house between 2006 and 2008 it was the most popular it was the hottest people wanted it everywhere I quickly realized that they were taking our products marking it up and then driving it down there and getting almost twice what we were getting here in San Francisco for it so when I realized that there was a large margin that I was missing out on I started doing it I was only like 22 and drove the horrible speed limit of like 55 miles an hour down the 101 to 5 yeah it was a little bit scary you know to be doing what we were doing and I didn't want to get in trouble I didn't want to get busted I didn't want to spend days in jail because I was growing plants don't get caught yeah I would think about my family a lot you know I'd be like don't get caught guys don't get caught I visualize what my life would look like when I was done and out of this job out of his career like what are my next steps and knowing that like this was not going to be it for me it's just something that I didn't want to do as a lifelong career and eventually I made my goal and I got out I learned so much from my experience and growing blue dream I learned about relationships about trust you know I always tell people yeah I mean money grow on trees before I made flower arrangements for brides and grooms I learned to use the things that I had and the tools and the gifts that I had to be much more successful [Music] [Music]", "qkc9DZ9B_PU": "Hello everyone my name is Tony, in today's\nvideo we'll be checking out exactly how I built this 3 gallon blue dream shrimp\ntank right behind me. And at the end of the video we'll have a\ncloser look inside. Let's get started. So we're going to use black lava stone for\nthe hardscape and we've got a few of the bigger uglier pieces here. I'm just going to\nsmash them up with this hammer, just so we can use them for details. And the\nreason why I chose a lava rock is because it's light and it's porous, so the plants\nwe picked; mosses and bucephalandra will be able to grip to the surface\nfairly easily. It was a lot harder than expected to smash up honestly. And there\nwe are, that should be enough. For my background I cut to size a piece of diffuser plastic I got from an old LCD monitor. I wasn't too sure how I was going\nto attach it but it turns out it just stays there by itself. Now the tank I got from buceplant.com is\na UNS 3N and holds three gallons of water, and the light fixture is an ONF\nFlat Nano Stand full-spectrum LED light. So what I'm gonna do first is build up\na little bit of height in the back with some clay gravel. What I'm using is some\nleftover Seachem Flourite which is basically a porous clay, which is good\nfor holding in the nutrients, and will make a nice place for beneficial bacteria to\ngrow. I then used an old paintbrush just to level it out and make a nice even slope. For the main substrate layer we'll just\nbe using fine natural sand. The small granule size will also help with a sense\nof scale at the end. Because we'll be attaching most of the plants to the\nrocks there's really no need for any aqua soil in the front but we will add\nsome in the back because we will be planting a few stem plants. Building up a\nslope in the back also gives depth to our tank. Where you daddy? Well it looks like we have a little\nvisitor, maybe he'll be a good boy for us. (Blahh) don't think so, we're gonna have to take a little interval. Alright so let's try this again.\nso I don't really have a plan of action going in we're just gonna see where the\nhardscape materials take us. While placing the Lava Rock and made sure that the\ngood sides were facing forward. If you're enjoying the video so far, please\nsubscribe to my channel, and give this video a like, and also click that Bell\nicon if you want to be notified for any future videos. I played around with the hardscape quite a\nbit just trying to make a solid structure. I didn't want to use any glue on\nthis. I just knew I wanted to leave a little exit point between the rocks, a\nlittle pathway. If you can imagine shrinking yourself down to that size you\ncould just walk through that little gap right there. That's what I was going for. I decided to add spider wood too so it looked like roots coming down\nbetween the cracks. And the three pieces I got were really beautiful but, a lot of\nthe pieces did not fit in the hardscape so I had to cut them off and we are\ngonna reattach them, in a better position shortly. I then added some of the\nsmaller crushed up pieces of lava stone that were broke with a hammer\nearlier in the video, just to some details. So I'm gonna be using Gorilla\nGlue gel to reattach these spider wood pieces, and it's completely aquarium safe\nit's a cyanoacrylate based adhesive, and yeah that's the wrong top. Let's try again,\nwe actually want the green piece. So it reacts to moisture so these little\npieces of wood here have actually been soaking in water for a while, so that\nshould help the curing process. so you don't need much just a little dab\nof glue, you don't want to go overboard. The downfall of this type of glue it does dry\nwhite, which is a little bit if an eye sore. So if you can get a more\nprofessional aquarium glue that dries clear that's a much better option\nhonestly. So just holding the wood in place for a few seconds should be enough\nat this point. Yeah it looks fine, so I'm just gonna continue and do the rest the\nsame way. It's important I'm adding these little bits of spider wood back. Because\ndetails make all difference if you going for a natural looking design. if I had\na larger selection of wood I could have totally avoided this part, but you're\njust gonna do the best with what you've got. I Actually find it more fun this\nway anyway because you can be more creative. So I'm just gonna use these last few\npieces down the bottom here, just so it looks like the roots have grown down, in\nbetween the rock formations. Now that we've finished adding the spider wood back in, I'm just gonna clean up the front a little bit and add a few\nmore extra details with this smashed up lava stone. After inspecting the hardscape for a\nwhile I felt like it was just missing something, so I did this piece of\ndriftwood that I found down by the river a while back, and it actually just fit\nperfectly on top. Now don't know about everyone else but to me it looks a\nlittle bit like a Dragon are some sort of Guardian, let me know in the comments\nwhat you think it looks like up there. So I'm just adding a few bits of lava stone\nin the back here to fill in the gaps. I actually did leave about an inch in the\nback behind the hardscape, because I want to plant some stem plants to grow up\nbehind there. So I'm just filling in the gaps here, so nothing leaks forward,\nbecause I'm gonna actually add some aqua soil behind there. So I thought I'd be\nclever and use a funnel, and I poured it in too fast and it got stuck, but we\neventually got it all in there, there it is. To make plans in a little easier, I'm\nactually going to add some sand back over the top of the aqua soil. so now the hardscape is finally complete,\nwe can get onto planting. If you're enjoying this video so far, remember to hit like and subscribe. Let's continue with this piece of wood here. So you may be\nwondering why we've taken this wood back out we've just glued in there. Well\nwe're actually gonna attach moss to it so let's see how that goes. What we're going to be using is weeping\nmoss, which hangs down instead of growing up. So it gives a really cool effect like\nvines. So I'm just gonna set that there for now, because what we need to do first\nis give this a little spray down which will help them moss stick to it, while we stick the moss to it. So I'm going to use this cool pair of extremely sharp\nspring-loaded scissors to cut this moss up into little pieces. But first let's\ntake a little piece off see what we're dealing with. Let's take a closer look at this\nmoss. So it's not the softest feeling moss, it's a little bit stringy feeling.\nLet's try and get one strand out, see how it grows. So the branches on this piece\nlook slightly irregular, small tiny leafs you can't really see, but it's quite nice.\nSo we're just gonna cut this up real small then, and attach it to this wood. And\nhopefully it'll grow out real well and hang down just the same way, in a few\nmonths time. So my plan is just to roll the moss up\ninto a nice little ball, give it a snip and another snip, I'll just make a nice\nlittle pile over here, I'll just do this a few more times and we should be alright. It's actually quite satisfying snipping\nthrough the moss ball here. Okay so that should be enough moss for now. See how far that gets us. So first of all I'm gonna add some moss up here then add some all the way down here, I'm gonna leave the bottoms bare because I want it to hang down in that area, and I'm gonna make a point to cover these joints where we glued the\nextra roots on, and also going to glue some on these little skinny bits because\nI think that will look cool. so I'm gonna use all-purpose thread to tie this moss to the wood. Now you can use fishing line if you have it, I don't actually\nfish so I don't have any on hand. But I do have thread. Don't Sow, but I do have thread. So let's use this. we'll just get our little piece ready for when we start to tie. so I'm just gonna start at the top here, a nice thin coat is all you need you don't want to lay on too thick\nbecause the moss underneath won't get any light and it'll probably just turn\nbrown and die, and cause excess nitrates in your tank which you don't want. So let's start wrapping this moss onto the wood. So you basically just want to pin it down, just tie down the main clumps to begin with, then you\ncan focus on getting the little stringy bits that stick out. And we're gonna trim\nit at the end anyway so any excess moss that's sticking out too far we're just\ngonna snip off. It is a little bit tricky, a little bit time-consuming. It's actually got stuck here so I'm just gonna have to unwind it. Try your best, do it\nas neatly as possible, make sure you get all the moss down. You don't want any\nfloating off when you put it in the water, so make sure it's tied down\nreally well. So that should do for the first section\nso let's tie it off, make sure you get a good knot in there because you don't want it coming unraveled under water. As the moss grows it will attach itself\nto the wood with little brown hairs called rhizoids, so soon the string will\nbe buried deep underneath of the moss and if it does come loose it won't\nmatter cos the moss will be securely attached to the wood. We're just gonna\nuse the same technique and add a little more moss on this piece of wood, on either side, tie it up real good with a nice tight knot. That should actually do it\nfor this piece. For the second piece of wood we're going to use a different\ntechnique to attach the moss, were going to try and gluing it see if it's any better. Again we'll be using this trusty gorilla\nglue gel, completely aquarium safe. their are other options out there, but this\nis what we have on hand. Give it a nice spray down so the moss sticks. We just have to prepare a little more moss again so let's take some off this sheet here and ball it up. Give it a nice little snip. So I'm going to want to attach moss all over the main portions of this piece of wood up and down these viney parts as well think will look cool. Cover all the joints, pretty much the\nsame idea except I'm going to be gluing it this time. So I'm just gonna apply a little dab directly onto the wood here. That's actually a little bigger than I\nwanted. But let's just go with it. Just squeeze this extra water out here\nwe don't need all that. Alright So let's just lay it on, give it a little press down. It should stick fairly instantly. Already it seems a lot easier just gluing and sticking, so let's keep going. Well their are consequences of course. Sticky fingers. Again you don't have to lay it on too heavily. I may have put it on a little too thick here\nmyself, but we'll use those little spring scissors, and give it a nice trim at the end. Okay so this is the final result. I have\nto say that was much much easier than tying it, so I think for this final piece\nhere, we're gonna glue it again. And as you can see we've barely used any of this moss. just taking it from around the edge so there should be plenty left for this and\na little extra, so let's get to gluing. Alright so that one's done, that was\nquick wasn't it? So now that we've successfully attached to moss to all\nthree pieces of our wood, we just need to clean them up a little bit with these\nscissors here, just gonna snip off all the extra bits that are hanging. We just want it as close as possible to the wood which will help give the moss more light exposure, which will help it grow and get established quicker. And you don't need\nto take much off just a few snips here and there. Just the pieces that are\nsticking out noticeably, because you want to enjoy watching it grow in itself. So I'm just gonna repeat this process now with the other pieces of wood, and we should be\nready to move on. Everything is ready to go. All my\nwonderful plants from buceplant.com check them out.\nWe've got our moss over here. We've got a nice little tissue culture plant, save that for later.\nOkay. First things first let's give the tank a nice spray down. Get everything nice and saturated. And the reason why I'm spraying it down right now is because again we're gonna be using this glue and it helps things stick a little\nbetter. The first plant we'll be using is this nice little Brownie Blue Bucephalandra, I\nthink I'm gonna glue it and attach it to the bottom of the rocks down here. So I'm\ngonna use the larger leafed bucephalandras that I have in the foreground,\nand the small leaved in the background. Again to help with the sense of scale.\nAnd I apologize because I did lose little a tiny bit of footage there, not sure why. So the\nsecond plant is Little Red Star, again bucephalandra. What I'm gonna do with\nthis is actually gonna snip the rhizome directly in half and now we have two\nplants. Alright so I'm going to attach this one\ndirectly to this lava stone hiding underneath here so let's take it out. So let's see, we're going to want to attach it\nsomething like this, layed across. Let's add a little bit of glue, don't\nneed much just a little dab And we'll just press that on gently, hold it down for a few seconds. It shouldn't take too long to attach. And just a quick little spray to speed up the\ncuring process. Then we'll tuck him back down under there. Alright, perfect. We'll just do the same with the second piece we cut off. Attach it to this little rock here. There, he looks quite nice. A little spray,\nand we're gonna put him in the opposite side. Our next type of bucephalandra is\ncalled Arrogant Blue and again we're going to attach it to a little piece of\nlava stone. Just make sure it's positioned nicely and hold it down. There we go, I really like the look of that one. The cool thing about attaching these to rocks is you can move them around and rearrange them if you need to.\nSo we'll just pop him in here for now. So the next bucephalandra we have\nis Lamandau Mini Purple. There's quite a few little rhizomes of this, so we'll choose a few nice places throughout the tank, and then glue it to the hardscape. We'll probably just pick a nice few spots here and there, up on these rocks here. Before we go any further I wanted to add our spider wood back in, because if we're gonna be attaching more plants to the hardscape we don't want them hidden behind into these pieces of wood, so we really need to get these back in here so\nwe know where to plant. So now our mossy woods back in it's\nlooking quite cool already. So now we just have to look between the gaps, and\nfigure out which would be the best places to attach the rest of this buce.\nI think this spot right here is the perfect start. Okay I think that looks\ngreat right there. This next piece I have is called Black Pearl what a cool name.\nso where should we put this one? I'm actually going to apply the glue directly to the back of this piece. I'm gonna stick it right under here. I think it's a really\ncool place for it, it's gonna get some light from the back. If you look under there it's\nlike a little cove, can you imagine the Pirates coming through, heading towards\nthe beach? I still have those little pieces of Lamandau Mini Purple, so I'm just sticking them around in places that I think will look the best. So now that we're we're finished with the bucephalandra, we have a Mini Bolbitis which is an aquatic fern.\nIt also has rhizomes which we can attach directly to the hardscape. So I wanna\nstick some in the back right here in hopes that it will grow up, and maybe even\ngrow emersed in the future. While you're planting your aquarium it's\nimportant to remember to keep spraying it, you don't want those plants to dry\nout while you're working. We'll also be using a little bit of\nJava moss for some variation, I'm just gonna glue it to some of these bare looking\nsurfaces. Java moss is cool it grows up as opposed to the willow moss which\ngrows down. I'm also adding some to the driftwood at the top which will help the\ntransition between the two different surfaces look more natural. The final plant we'll be adding to the front of this hardscape is Hydrocotyle Tripartita. It's a tissue culture, it' actually\nlooks really really fresh and nice in there, the roots are bound inside this\ngel stuff so I've washed it off, and we have a few nice clumps here, we're\njust gonna separate them out and plant them sporadically around the bottom\nof the hardscape. So we don't need to bury it in the substrate, we'll just find some nice little gaps and tuck it in. And it will grow just fine. Okay everyone we're almost finished, I\nthink is looking quite nice in there now. I think we filled in all the necessary\ngaps, there's a nice balance between green and shadow. Yeah I think we did a\ngood job. Just gonna use this crushed up lava stone, just a few more finishing\ntouches, the plants covered some of the details we had so I'm just gonna\nreplace those. Because you can never have too many details. I almost forgot we didn't add our background, let's just pop it on here. There we go. Now the filter we're gonna be using is\ncalled a Dymax Slim Flo and it's really small, perfect for a nano tank of\nthis size, I've actually decided to hang it on the side here, and I've left a nice gap\nbetween the hardscape. I'll probably add some custom media into it, right now it's\njust got one of those default cartridge slots which don't work very well. So now it's time to fill it up, I'm just\ngonna use this sandwich bag just to block the water flow so it doesn't\ndisturb the sand too much as I fill it. And I am filling this with reverse\nosmosis water remineralized to around 200 TDS with the gh kh+ salty shrimp\n remineralizing powder. So I'm just gonna release some air\nbubbles, and make sure everything's seated correctly. So I've been staring at this awhile I've noticed I want to add some more moss, on these pieces of wood down here, over here too\nmaybe, it's just looking a little bare. So let's drain it again, I'm just going to\nglue some more moss directly onto the wood. So while we have the tank drained I'm just\ngonna glue a little bit of this extra weeping moss on to these bare pieces of\nwood, that I noticed when the tank was full. So just a little dab of glue, and just\nfill in a few of these bare looking gaps basically. Now I think it makes a big difference\nactually, I'm really glad I did that. Alright so now that's done let's get\nthis filled back up. Alright, so now let's turn this filter\non. Because I don't have any cycled media I\nhave to let this tank cycle by itself for a few weeks, which will let the\nplants grow in as well before I add any shrimp into this thing. I'm quite pleased with the way it turned out, I'm really looking forward to watching it grow in. To help the cycling process I'm gonna be adding this starter bacteria from microbe-lift. from time to time we'll also be adding this special blend water care. Pause the video if you want to read these directions here. And as you can see here the water did get a\nlittle bit cloudy, that's just bacterial growth, and that\nwill clear up in the next few days. During this time I added a pink ramshorn\nsnail, also a blue one who's hiding right now. It took a few days for the wall to clear up\nbut as you can see from these images right here it did clear pretty well. their was a little delay in adding these plant cuttings but here they are, so we're just gonna pop them in the back where we left that gap,\nand added the aqua soil under the sand right there. I'm just going to plug them in\nwith the tweezers real quick, and there we go, looks great. Hopefully they grow\ntall and healthy for us. A few weeks later the tank was ready and the shrimp had finally arrived. Now there was a vote on whether to get blue or red shrimp, and\nBlue Dream shrimp won on my Instagram page, so give me a follow if you want to\nbe involved in anything like that in the future. After acclimating the shrimp for\na few hours I added them in there, and we were finally finished. You may have\nnoticed I moved the tank too into my bathroom, it's been enjoyed much more by\nthe rest of the family. So we've started with the 11 Blue Dream Neocaridina\nShrimp, with a whole bunch of ramshorn snails. There's really no helping that.\nOnce you introduce those snails there's no turning back, so you really do have to love them, and thankfully, I really love snails. And as\nyou can see back there, they love each other too. Over the next few weeks the\nplants and moss really really took off well, thanks to the ONF Flat Nano Stand Light. As you can see there it's half drained during a water change,\nand the moss just looks incredible.

I'm going to leave you all now with little\ncompilation of some macro footage of what's going on inside that tank a few\nmonths later.", "dOIPYKdKYy4": "what's going on fish nerds it has been a while since we've looked at my shrimp tanks so today I'm going to show you the cherry shrimp and the fantasy blue dreams and talk a little bit about how I care for them let's get started alright so here is the 10 gallon cherry shrimp tank and depending on how long you've been watching my videos you may or may not remember the video when I first got these guys I ordered 20 of them nine months ago from flip aquatics rub and as you can see there are definitely a lot more than 20 shrimp in this tank at this point and I did just feed so they're all starting to swarm up here to the front of the tank and I don't know how many there are but I'm guessing at least a few hundred shrimp in this tank I'm not the best at guessing numbers you might look at it and get a completely different number than what I'm estimating but they have definitely exploded in here either way and I'm not really doing anything special for these guys as far as taking care of them I feed them every day and I would actually attribute a lot of the success that I've had with these guys on this right here the automatic water change the drip system because I do have 12 gallons of water per day going through this tank because this is a half gallon per hour drip emitter because that's how much I need this tank to drip down into the tank below because that's how my drip system runs each tank drips into this tank below it so in order to support this entire rack I've got both of these tanks taken 1/2 gallon per hour as well as the third with the third actually dripping down into the 30 and 20 gallons over on the other rack but in order for that to be enough water for the entire rack I have to have 12 gallons per each of these tanks which means that this tank is getting a hundred and twenty percent water change every single day so constantly clean fresh water so I really don't have to worry about over feeding especially with the snails the snails pick up with the shrimp don't eat and then the water change takes care of the rest plus I do have all this hornwort up here which not only helps to keep the water clean but also gives them a nice surface to graze on and you can see a bunch of them or well I can get past the glare they're all grazing up in there all the time and I actually like to get up here sometimes and look down and a lot of times they'll actually be climbing around on top of that little algae ball there but it's kind of a cool view if I can get the camera to focus in on some of these from above to watch these foraging around near the surface it's pretty neat but like I said I do attribute a lot of the success to the automatic water change the drip system because one the drip system keeps the water parameter is completely stable because it's just a slow steady drip constantly so I don't have any big swings I'm not letting the water quality get down to a certain point and then doing a big water change is just a constant slow steady drip so they're essentially always being drip acclimated to the water and also with 120 percent water change I'm not having to worry about over feeding too much which also means that I can feed them plenty enough that they're constantly breeding and you can see they are constantly breeding all over the place they've just exploded in this tank and they've also now spread down here to this forty gallon if you move down here and they're actually starting to really take off and this tank as well you see some babies there she's gorgeous to focus in on her we're back there so they're doing great and this tank as well starting to really take over in here ton of bristlenose frying here as well I'm hoping this tank will sort of just take off and turn into a bob steam fot esque breeding for-profit tank with all this hornwort in here and the Guppies and the bristlenose and the shrimp it's doing pretty well so far you see I just fed so everybody's kind of swarm in this area right here but yeah I really don't do anything special for my cherry shrimp I just feed them plenty and I keep their water clean and keep the parameter stable with the drip system and as far as what I feed these guys I feed them pretty much everything and everything I feed my fish I'll also feed to the Guppies whether that be you know flakes pellets even the green beans that I feed the bristlenose and also I will feed shrimp specific foods I feed the shrimp king complete I feed the shrimp king protein shrimp king mineral I do also feed back Turei AE for the baby shrimp so that there's plenty of biofilm and things for the babies to graze on I think that's an excellent food for shrimp 'lets and also one of my favorite things to feed these guys is just regular old spirulina powder which you can get on Amazon it's actually human food grade it's just a really fine powder that actually look it basically just dissolves into the water and it just turns the water totally green and then as it does dissolved in the water they can actually kind of filter feed a little bit and grab it out of the water and eat it but it all it ends up just settling all over everything and it just creates this nice green film all over the glass and all over the plants and the wood and the gravel and everything and that just gives them a great thing to just graze on and a really good form high protein and because it is something that they can just you know pick off of everything and graze on the film that it leaves behind it's just a great food for these guys and so here is the fantasy blue tank I did start off with 10 of these guys just about a month ago and they're doing great I've already had two females berry up and release babies and those babies are already growing very quickly it's getting harder and harder to tell the babies from the adults just waiting on females to berry up again and really hoping that it won't be too long before the babies start breeding themselves but these guys are doing great they're eating on some shrimp king mineral right now everybody's acting really good but it's looking really good I cannot wait until this tank blows up and looks like this tank like I said we're only a month into it but we've already had a couple batches of babies get this glare out of here and everybody's growing everybody's doing good I just love these shrimp these fantasy blues the blue dreams have got to be my favorite of the Neo caridina as far as their color goes love the look of these shrimp maybe that that one back there on the food just is so dark it almost looks black but that's not a black shrimp that's just a deep deep blue absolutely gorgeous alright guys shorter video this week just wanted to show you my shrimp tanks and how they're doing it's been a while since we've really looked at them here on the channel so just kind of wanted to put them in the spotlight a little bit and give you an update on the cherry shrimp and the blue dreams and I have had a ton of people asking about me selling the cherry shrimp and I have talked about recently I'm trying to move away from breeding for profit just because I've got so much going on I don't have time to focus on it and stuff but because of popular demand I am going to temporarily put the cherry shrimp on my website fish nerdstore calm so you can check out the link in the description below and that will just be a temporary thing for those that have been begging for it so I'll try to have that by the time this video goes out but if they're not out on the website yet keep checking they'll be there very soon but I am gonna try to get them out there by the time the video comes out and I do want to say thank you guys for that support and wanting to buy it from me it means a lot and thank you guys for watching this video for supporting the channel

looking at a Dutch without further ado jump to close up [Music] all right Burke heavily soiled bird mode you strap in the comment section under we take a look at the days blood they were looking at this Dutch and this is blue dream not sure what exactly the flavors gonna be um I'm thinking that it might be along the lines I like your blue game oh you but never blunts that's what I'm thinking anyway but you also even be like a blueberry or something along those lines um let's go ahead and get this out the pack so when you see these blessed with leg I perk of these are the dream fusion oh don't really give a smell on it from back here free uniform glutes let's run all of our tests marches on that one there [Music] let's bring the separate smell test a new track me the idea with the sandwich all right we're club oh I'm getting a strong presence of vanilla um what reminds me about the blue gang but it's also a slight berry or fruity kind of element to it that I'm not really able to identify um if you know what that is let me know in comment section what do you think this smell is supposed to be I'm thinking of another it made me some kind of berry but again let me know what you think in the comment section wrong go ahead get this unwrapped crank it up maybe something sweet and it took back up as you grow it smoke it see what it smokes like so he's a fire on his bank soon [Music] [Music] [Music] all right Burke hope you got this Dutchman dream fusion Road up and I was originally thinking that it's kind of like the blue game but as our voicing it to roll it it doesn't really taste the same um kind of more of like a tobacco present there's also like some fruity or elements coming through then the blue game has um we're gonna get sapphire on and see what this smoke is like that may give us a better indication of what the taste is supposed to be so I see some fire on this paint see what it do all right burn some only just recently seen these but not sure how long they've been around but a couple of days ago I seen the comment someone asked me did I see them so I've been looking for him since I finally just found oh well hey get some fire on the front of it and see the first size teams from a I was like that's an indication of what the smoke we may taste like [Music] well it has kind of that blue game essence to it was like a vanilla and tobacco mix not really getting any of the three elements that I've noticed when I was growing up but they may come in as we smokes let's take first poll to see what the blood actually tensley [Music] all right yeah that's definitely up of another blood and it's um similar to the blue gang it just has a little bit more complexities to it the blue game has a basically tobacco and vanilla this has tobacco vanilla in some underlying through the other myths that um make this taste a little bit better [Music] that vanilla is down beneath though pressing on the inhale you get a lot of the vanilla essence to exhale you another stays strong but the aftertaste is rare that fully mist starts to develop a little bit also on my lips I can taste it for you a little bit from the gut itself [Music] feeling pretty good that is don't typically have a problem unless you don't roll them correctly [Music] doesn't seem like it's gonna smoke for that long you seem like it's burning fast he's alone leave your head into ass off with this type threefold decent color Ashville dark gray [Music] even getting a little irritation from the smoke right here sometimes you'll feel hear taste them down here and get like to Depot and pull I don't fit down here just like little irritation in my throat [Music] flavor this is really good um Liana vanilla is its strong salad but there is another foodie element in here that can't identify but if you know what it is jumping in the comment section [Music] this might be one of my favorite dozens of them I like them another presence and their foodie elements to it [Music] I'd only has my throat a little irritated it's not it's not too harsh on smoke anyway as far as the up fusions go this is definitely my favorite they will probably be the Dutch Jews in didn't maybe the honey things in atomic Java that probably the order for me but let me know your order uh that's easy but don't smoke the recitation will follow me on instagram it too but Mari Twitter tullamarine Facebook at tamari live [Music] yeah even when I heard about this blunts existence I thought it would be like a blue gang it is very similar very similar to the games if you like that of another flavor vanilla tobacco flavor I'm sure you'll like this um there's a little bit of a fruitiness to it but not a lot to be looking for a fruity but this is it really the way to go again there are some fruity elements to it just not that whole bunch and if you really just like tobacco you're not gonna like this but there's a very strong taste of vanilla [Music] I'm still while smoking and we'll smoke these the other one right after this damn to the word about barefoot [Music] [Music] Oh [Music]", "gVixNJ3fjD0": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] in distance [Music] [Music] [Music] this

"DkMSeXtOoYs": "[Music] all right so it is super late right now and I just got done harvesting all these blue dreams from my blue dream tank now I've got two blue dream tanks going right now these are from Lucas but I didn't get a lot of them so I wanted to grab you know some more genetics that's why you saw me do an unboxing of these not too long ago but I've got a 10 gallon that's basically full of them so I just went ahead and I picked come on focus I picked the best ones that I could and I pulled the Siamese algae eaters out of this 40 gallon high tech tank and made sure I had a good pre-filter on that hang on back and this thing is getting co2 but it actually might disconnect it and just go with the sponge filter I'm not sure yet because I want a little bit of co2 in here but I'd rather just have this on a sponge and do away with the hang on back but there are ways around that for now I think that's good enough but if they're always feeding on that thing because of course that's collecting all that stuff I may change it up and I may remove that and just do co2 some other way or not at all and then go with a sponge but yeah this is going to be a blue dream tank now you notice this is one of the few tanks that I'll have shrimp in that doesn't have black substrate from my knowledge blue dreams and black roses you don't have to go with dark substrate now these guys lucas's I don't think are this dang dark some of mine are just straight black or very close to black it seems like on that black substrate so I think I can get away with putting them on this if I feel like it's an issue I mean there look at all that green anyways the moss is green plants are green so if that substrate is a problem I'll just you know put a quarter inch or an eighth inch of black down and blasting sand on it and that should be fine hopefully but yeah hopefully this you know hopefully it works out in that substrate doesn't become a problem I don't think it will but yeah I don't know how many that is quite a few and there's definitely way more in that tank so I may add more I just wanted to see how this worked before I put you know all of the best in here I wanted to make sure this tank was alright for him and you know I didn't just start losing shrimp but I don't think I will I move shrimp around the fish room all the time I don't have any issues I hadn't had I haven't had a shrimp die in probably six months now so yeah they're gonna live in here with the down I forest and hopefully pretty soon the flamingos Perth forest so right now for acclamation what I'm doing is I've got them in this little knot breeder box specimen container I guess is what they're called and yeah I'm just pouring in a little bit of extra water and I actually broke this and then I took little bits of the egg crate and just super glued it back together and I have not had an issue I've hung this on the outside of Tanks and it broke right there I think like right there's where it broke right yeah I know it broke right there and I've not had a single issue yeah and it broke right there and all the way across I've hung it on the outside of Tanks lots of weight on it and no issues so yeah well that one Harriette there is you see that one dead center there's yeah right there it's got a little bit of discoloration there I think I might call him out I don't think it's an issue compared to everyone else he does look a little bit different but sometimes that can just be what's in there in their you know their stomach I think that's just what he was eating occasionally what I get in these the only problems I have our Reds so I get a little bit of blue red release and those I do call and do a coal tank I think that's just food though I think that he was eating mulberry leaves someone think that's an issue but we're gonna let them sit here a little bit longer and then we'll put him in and we'll see what they do all right so I'm about to go ahead and dump them in I just added a little bit more water and it do you want to cover something real quick if your shrimp are stressed out you'll see it right now these aren't stress they're just sitting on the bottom attempting to graze if their stress they're gonna swim around kind of like he is like he's trying to swim and like see if they can get out of their situation and you'll know when if all of your shrimp are just swimming in circles and like a bucket it's because they're stressed and that'll happen to you generally when you get new shrimp in and you're dripping them sometimes if they start swimming kind of like in circles just swimming around frantically like they're trying to leave sometimes they'll even crawl up the sides out of the water that's that's a definite sign that they're stressed and you should stop or slow your drip but these ones here they're just you're just trying to graze so they're definitely good and I wouldn't suspect that they would have any any stress issues during this from the water at least but anyways we're gonna go ahead and free these and we'll just let him go out at their own pace look freedom freedom look at all that you only other tank mates in here are a few Amano shrimp and some snails just some pink ram's horns over there chowing down on a green bean oh and I'm gonna have to change a few things here I'm gonna have to fix that little siphon I'll show you how I do that - they're so beautiful come on you more and all of you get out ah good thing that did not fall in Jesus all right so they're all in how that one has a little bit of red in him all right Emma's gonna come out where is he that one there looks like he has red is it red or is it food I think it's red now that I've got him in like better light maybe it's not red it doesn't show up on the camera I don't know I'll keep an eye the real reason I wanted to put you know these shrimp into this bigger tank and I'll show you so over here on these little 10 gallons with them so heavily planted and this is the this is the blue dream tank there's a you see a coal right there see that's that's a blue really right there that one's got to get cold but don't worry about that later the issue I have with these is they're just so small they're really hard to coal out of and they're also congesting like your shrimp will hit kind of a de max capacity and I had that happen to these Reds over here not long ago I've had it happen to my snowballs so and I just haven't been able to do anything cuz I've been busy and I'm finally getting around to it but yeah it's it's hard to get a net in here it's hard to get your hand in here it's also hard to see because I keep them pretty densely planted there's no room for the plants to grow so they just crammed up against the sides and it's just it's hard to see in here and find all these little shrimp so when you do have a cold you know one little scoot in he's into the into the thick the thick leaves and you can't see him and you can't get him out so it's hard to coal and that's that's one of the main reasons I want to get them into this tank besides it being bigger and doing a split on the colony for you know better lines but yeah it looked like red on the you know from from my point of view but I didn't see it on the camera so maybe that guy's fine the shrimp look fine gosh they look better in here it looks so much better in here it's it's the light though and again those are those ebay lights from CLL Pet Supplies who I don't recommend you buying them from but they're the ones the only ones that sell them because I've gotten like two broken ones from them yeah I'm happy about that but um there's an Amana I'm on focus there we go yeah hopefully this works but yeah so this little guy here that that is sewing mesh I'll end up doing on that and I have it done over here on this shrimp tank that is just a reusable I got it from sprouts or you can get them from Whole Foods as well it is a reusable bag for like your vegetables and stuff so you don't use the little plastic ones and they're fairly cheap and I just have that stuff lying around I'm sure jabberin aquatics uses like wedding veil mesh and I'm sure that's probably even cheaper and the exact same thing so that's what I'm gonna go ahead and put on here real quick and then we'll do one final one final update on before we go all right so here is what I've got this is the little mesh stuff you can say got from sprouts a little grocery store near here and yeah it's just thin mesh probably very similar to wedding Bale stuff so yeah I just cut this up that's good enough hopefully this works I don't like regret this the helens think if it didn't him all right that's it all right that is it she's done got that put on there I'll sloppy like but hey it should work gonna have to go back over to that and try and fix it up because I kind of not like that and I don't know we'll see we'll see if this tank stay co2 because Dave that's the torgul well we'll see if this tank stays co2 or not because I've been actually accidentally hooked up the wrong co2 because I disconnected and reconnected some so I didn't have co2 to this for like the last month and it's been getting way less water changes I've been doing water changes once every 10 to 10 days to like 14 days and I haven't had any issues dosing it every day with Pro PBS like I have been of course I'm dosing less but I'm dosing on opposite days now so more nutrients are available but I'm giving less of them so yeah I don't know this may just go to a sponge and maybe some type of co2 system I'm not sure I might use one of those little discs I just don't like those I don't think they're very effective but you know hey we'll see shrimp looked to be doing good they're just moseying around grazing so and all that down a is just so so thick so they've got like normally I like to keep moss in my shrimp tanks so they have this place to bed down and really and really make like their little their little homes and or whatever little safe spots nothing can get them but that down way you can just see it's just it's super super thick and that is just all the way back that whole little thing it's like three-quarters of the tank cuz that half the tank is like right there and it creeping over so yeah they've got a lot of places to hide and graze in that down way so threw in a few katappa leaves for them those can start to deteriorate also give me some humic substances in the tank just making all-around healthier tank so yeah that is the new blue dream tank I'm super excited we'll do an update on this as time goes by and we'll see how well the breeding I didn't get a count on those if anyone wants to count them and let me know I'd appreciate it and we can see you know how long it takes for this thing to just be covered with shrimp because right now we've got enough to kind of I don't know to be present and to actually see them with all those places to hide but yeah we'll check back in here and I don't know a couple months but yeah let me know what you guys think I guess like the next time we should check in and I don't know any recommendations this is my down annoy tank so I mean there is a limit up until what I'll do with it because I need that down or to grow but I also want those shrimp to do really really good that being said I don't think down do I need co2 I do want to get those flamingos crypts growing a little bit faster so that's why I'm keeping co2 in here now so maybe one PSA's are like an adult plant which will take at least three or four more months I'll disconnect co2 but yeah we'll see how the shrimp do and if the shrimp do good shrimp will come first but yeah anyways guys thanks for watching and we'll catch you on the next one oh yeah and this thing here this twenty long black substrate is going to be for some orange shrimp that's the next thing I'm working on I've moved out 90% of the dwarf neon rainbows put them into a 75 and we're working I'm working on getting this tank ready for them I just kind of finish getting the fish out I want to Rescate it prep it for shrimp get some moss growing in it and then we'll split the orange tank and get the good ones in here so that'll be the next shrimp tank [Music] you [Music]", "0Ee5Sw_W-4U": "thanks ivy vine for 23 and today we are going to be reviewing the blue dream stream this sativa dominant hybrid is originating from California and it's a legacy status among the western coast rain cross between blueberry indica and haze sativa our system of haze blue-jean balances full body relaxation with a duration configuration we're gonna be using Phoenix because we're outside and hope everybody's having a great day its fourth of July weekend and I hope everybody's safe and not doing stupid things make smart choices cheers guys stupid the fourth of July here the they added a mission to get in this year usually it totally tastes like blueberry it's my favorite go to stream not in candy crush candy crush is like I wonder if anybody's gonna notice we actually have an intro and stuff now that's all thanks to our buddy yeah buddy we also have coming a my interns channel I have interns now so they'll be helping me like shades an intern and then my friend Morgan's an intern so we're gonna have more people helping me with my channel and it's gonna be great cuz never had like this and now it's like oh hey it's great because I don't have any of that experience didn't get it so not technologically savvy or the camera crew camera crew choose for the camera crew we went on at six mile walk today it was awesome my feet hurt but it was worth this total worth it's pokey outside there's children's cries violence my downswing gets stuck too much I need to put bring a tube of chapstick outside anyway this strain is like obviously a great sativa it makes me want to do [ __ ] like around the house like I'm automatically like after I smoke this I'll go in the room and I'll start cleaning or just put putting [ __ ] away or do the dishes makes you wanna play your game here is like Ultima games all right so that was our blue dream stream thanks to look it up because you get your hands on it ten out of ten Evans wrong well grow very well hydroponic which are those yes the best do it like I say hi", "oHjBDMMsKAk": "[Music] hello shrimp is armed idea for him shrimp stop hope everybody's doing well first off we'd like to apologize for the lack of content over the last couple of months on our channel with a growth of our online store and a destroyed hard drive with lots of footage we worked in a place where we just didn't have time left in the day to reshoot and redo videos we apologize for that and we'll try to rectify this as soon as possible by reviewing most of the videos that we had lined up so sit back and enjoy the first year back mike fossum drama but if you like drama how about subscribing and eating that bail notification to know when our next videos are uploaded now for the drama but the reason for that is that we've got so many different types and shades of blue shrimp that everybody gives it a different name and in every part of the country the ver part of the world and from reader to reader in this instance we're going to look at what we would call a blue dream shrimp now a blue dream shrimp is also known as a blue topaz some people call it blue diamonds these tons of names and from what you are seeing on your screen you might call it something else but for now I would call it a blue dream shrimp just to just to keep it as simple as possible but we will pull a blue dream shrimp is a shrimp that is a royal blue color complete from the top of its head to the bottom of its style it is completely blue there is no other shades of darker blue or lighter blue or black it is just royal blue from start to finish but the end of the day whatever you call this blue shrimp it is still a near cordeen Astra so the same rules that would apply with cherries or fire raids or tacos or oranges it all stays the same same water parameters same thang specifications same like specification say plants same everything everything just stays the same so for the people that didn't see our previous cheery video we'll do a quick rundown of what you need to keep and read these guys successfully the first thing that we would like to cover is the fact that keeping shrimp is very very addictive so be forewarned if you get one type that chances are very very good like you would end up with multiple tanks for different colors and different types of stroke so see this as your public service enhancement keeping them will probably lead to more tanks so number one tank you can basically keep Mirko Dina's in any size tank that you want or have but we would advise a tank size of at least one and a half foot and bigger generally buy or use the biggest thing that you can possibly get at that point of time we prefer our bria setups to be two foot in size approximately 60 liters and we get great success now the bigger that your tank size is the better and more stable your water conditions are so that's very important especially if you go over at some point later - harder to keep shrimp like Karadeniz they're not impossible full starter shrimp but they are much much harder now that the tank size is out of the way we can move over to what you put into your tanks now you can make this very expensive or inexpensive for yourself it depends on what you the hobbyist and keeper want to get out of the things the cheapest substrate that you would find for your shrimp tanks would probably be something like poof of descent or any sand substrate that you can either get at folders or at pizza it depends solely on what you have available to you and again on how much you want to spend now in most of our tanks we've got a da amaz\u00f4nia it is on the highest scale of substrates that you can use but in our opinion it is by far the best active substrate for keeping shrimp the results speak for themselves the amount of babies that reach adulthood is a lot more than any of the other substrates that we've even used the bonus on their Amazonia is that it is a buffering substrate which keeps your water at constant pH and you are able to grow most of the plants that you would find in the aquatic all be in it as well now the downside of course is the monetary value of the soil and as well as the fact that in time the buffering capability of the substrate goes down but knowing that we still prefer putting a DA in all of our tanks putting a ta with neo cadenas some raj say is spoiling them or going overboard because they don't need that nears are comfortable in most water conditions again you can even keep them on at bay bottom tank where they is nothing it is just the glass that they sit on it can be done now the biggest reason why we have a substrate in our tanks is to have plants in our tanks breeder setups normally don't have plants planted in the substrate especially if they're using active soil the active soil sole purpose is to buffer the water that is why it's there it is not for planting but in most tanks where people keep shrimp we've got launch blonde at Indy the general rule is match your plants to the substrate that you have or the setup that you want most shrimp tanks have got live plants in the the reason for that being it's just more than a decoration it is for the shrimp to graze on as well you would see them grazing through moss and some steam plants and stuff like that so add some live plants to your tank we prefer moss regardless of the type that you use we find a certain which is technically not a mosque to be the base type that you can add to your tank and we've got that in most of our tanks as well of the plants and substrate we move over to filtration you can get away with anything what we would advise is sponge filters preferably in our opinion double sponge filters you can use them the regular way or you can do conversions of them where you add power heads or hang on filters to them in some of our tanks we've got sponge filters as well as hang on the back filters canister filters and so on it again it depends on the type of setup and type of shrimps that we are keeping in that setup next up is heating if you can keep your temperature of your tank stable at 21 degrees during the year if it gets really cold like in Europe and America we're going to the minuses you would need to eat your tank in some form to keep the temperature above 18 degrees now generally it's cheaper to eat the room than individual tanks especially if you have more than one tanks between 21 and 24 degrees is the perfect temperature to keep near c\u00e1rdenas on now the most important part of this setup is going to be your water and shrimp's need water it might sound like a foregone conclusion but we've had people arriving with hamster cages to buy shrimp so shrimp need water people give them water let's get into a little bit more detail about the water the prescribed range for pH of near Kadena shrimp is about six point five to seven point eight but they can still if they fall out of this seat pH range pH is a measure of how acidic or basic water is the range goes from zero to 14 with seven being the most neutral a pH of less than 7 is considered acidic where the pH of greater than seven is considered as odd in our tanks we'd like to keep our pH around 7.2 but in some tanks it goes up to about 7.3 7.4 so if you keep in those ranges you will get the best results if you're unsure about what your pH of your tap water or rain water or well water is we advise you getting something like a pH pin that will test the water instantly or a test kit nowadays kids are important especially if you go over to harder to keep shrimp it is important for you to know your water conditions at any given time if you are experiencing problems next up we've got the TDS the TDS is the total dissolved solids in your water and it refers to any minerals or salt or metals that is dissolved in the water the TD is range for neo coordinates room is 150 to 250 in most of our tanks it is about 220 or they about before we try and reduce it the best way to reduce your TDS is by water changes where you add water with a low TDS to the tank that will gradually bring the TDS down something to keep in mind is that in time your TD is in your tanks will climb naturally that is because of food that you add to your tank and over time with evaporation so it's good to keep an eye on your TDS for indication of what's going on in your thank again you can use something like a TDS pin for biscuits but the actual most important port of your water to know is the G H and K H that G H is the General Orders and the KH is the carbonate hardness of your water you need to know what it is before you add any shrimp to your tanks again you can get these kits for it just to find out what it is if your ranges are way beyond the prescribed ranges which is a judge of six to eight or a KH of two to five if it is way out of these ranges you would need to look at either using RO water or rainwater and rememorize that to get to the correct ranges we cannot emphasize this more that this spot is going to be the crucial part in your water so make sure that these are within range if you don't want to go out and buy a pH or TDS pin or your GH and gauge tests or complete test kits most pet stores will taste your water for you for free when you get the results you would be able to do some things to bring your water in line for example if your pH is two I add some wood to your water or some leaf litter that will reduce the pH of your tank but with that it will increase the TDS so keep stuff like that in mind for every action there is an equal reaction please remember to cycle your tanks properly before you want to add any shrimp or fish pure tanks when we say cycle we refer to the ammonia or nitrogen cycle which converts ammonia to nitrite to nitrate that is done by the bacteria that is in your tank or in your filter that breaks down the ammonia you get products that will help you cycle your tank faster and also that will break down ammonia we use seeking Prime on all our tanks and we use it once a week regardless if we do a water change a water top-up or if we just put and ornate into our tanks it is very important that you don't get ammonia spikes because ammonia will kill off your shrimp now with the tank port covered if there's anything that I missed or you would like clarity on please put a comment down below and we will answer it don't be scared we all started somewhere in this hobby and it's better to ask than to guess so now it's time to go buy some shrimp and there's a couple of things that means we'd say that you should not win buying your first ones first off and most important is to buy them from a reputable breeder or online store or to go get them yourself at your local pet store we will advise you get at least 5 but aim to get teen because that increases your gene pool when you start off get them as small as possible but big enough for you to 6 them between males and females and that can be done when they just over 1 centimeter we will advise you get them as small as possible because shrimp only have a lifespan of about 18 to 24 months depending on water conditions so the smaller you get them the longer the lifespan in your tanks will be smaller shrimp also travel betta and acclimate better to water conditions another thing when you add your shrimp is to keep your water conditions as stable as possible I'll just spot the difference between a male and a female females are generally larger and more colorful than the males you can always look at the stomach and tail section where the females have got a bended or round stomach and the male's generally has a flat and sharp-edged stomach section now after you get your shrimps armed please trip acclimate them accordingly it takes approximately an hour to two hours to do it correctly there is no need to rush this stage now that they're in your tank you might ask what am I going to feed them well there are omnivores and will eat basically anything you give them but their main food source is produced naturally in their tank and is called biofilm note that neo cadena don't eat aquarium plants but they eat from it you will always find them actively searching through plants grazing on it going through the substrate throwing it around actively looking and eating bifel they are not like let's say a mono and narek snails that will literally eat algae so make sure you've got enough by form in your tanks for them at all times also make sure to add some leaves to they diet fresh and dried leaves are hundred percent fine we're Indian almond leaves will be on top of the list on the first side you can look at stuff like stinging nettles or spinach which you should be able to find relatively easy they will also be fine with normal fish flakes or any other processed foods on the process side there is one food that we can actively endorse which is back to AE it is by far our most favorite food and it promotes and grows bifel it's a powdered form food that covers your whole tank which makes it an excellent food not only for largest shrimps but also your babies now that everybody is feed and they are happy it's time to start reading these guys step 1 put on some very white and light the candle well it's a lot easier than that just give them some time it will happen it always does breeding usually happens of the female sheets our exoskeleton you will see the males are actively swimming around looking for the female when the happens there's a pheromone that is released into the water and they are looking for that female at that time if you're lucky enough to see the breeding happen you'll see the male jump on top of the females back where the eggs are located behind the eyes the breeding process is over relatively quickly and the eggs will then move from behind the eyes to underneath the females Billy the female is buried at this stage it's called Barry's because it looks like a bunch of berries being carried around now this pot will take approximately 30 days for the babies to be born and they are born as many replicas of the adults dependent on the water conditions they can be more male to female or the other way around keep in mind that these new babies won't move much in the first days and will stay basically in the same spot where they have been born so it is a good idea at this stage to feed a powder form of food either back to AE or pollen it will take approximately 90 days for these baby shrimp to grow to breeding size again where this whole breeding process will start over again at this stage when they are breeding keep your water conditions as stable as possible don't try and do too much let things happen naturally now if you are one of those people that go away on holidays or weekends in much stress what's going to happen with my shrimp well they are very very easy in that regard we don't have to stress too much we will advise the following steps to make sure that you don't come home with dead shrimp in your tank first off most important is remove your heater's from your tanks if something goes wrong 90 percent of the time it's usually a heater that broke and it boiled off all your water or something ridiculous as that the following thing you would want to do is before you go make sure that your filter has been cleaned or is clean and running properly and top of your tank to the maximum amount of water that it can go then add some almond leaves if it isn't in your tanks already and give them something like holiday food or feed them accordingly before you leave in the time that you're gone they'll be 100% fine and graze off of the Indian almond leave and the bio form that's in the tank so you don't have to do anything besides that well now that everything is said and done let's just watch these guys for a few minutes more in this time we'd like you to vote on our next video so one for product review a technical review or two for a shrimp tank companion what else can you put into your tank so that's one for product two for tank mate vote now okay so same old story guys remember to vote in the comments section below one or two for whichever following video you would like to see thanks for watching to the

"tCNZnYk6xMU": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from that if you couldn't tell from the title it is another cartridge video uh it's another populous herb cartridge video you know i only have i would say about one and a half videos on it i do have another video where you know we're we've just picked up pop herbs but i didn't really you know get into detail um the other flavors were pretty good um but i just had to i just had to try blue dream for myself i don't know i'm not really fond of blue dream but i rarely see it in a cartridge and i figured you know it's nine dollars you know if you didn't see my other papa herbs video it's nine dollars for a half gram cart of blue dream so you know i had to pop cop it and uh let me know you guys opinion on blue dream homie stevie says that purple punch is the new blue dream let me know your thoughts on that that's what he says but yeah it's the cartridge itself i already been smoking on it as you can tell you know they don't come this low but very very enjoyable very very candy-like uh i wouldn't say blueberry taste but i don't let's just get it handy i'm gonna put it in my tutron family so cheers like i get a slight weird taste to it like the similar taste that you would get from like i don't know it's like that weird black licorice taste i don't know if it's exactly it's like a weird taste but then you get the the the sweetness uh kind of um like a like a candy taste um but overall good it is just lit when it comes to papa herbs it is going to be distillate uh if you didn't see the back it is running at 87.60 or 87.63 percent uh packaged on packaged on august 10th of 2020 and uh it says right here manufactured by sublime so yeah uh i mean the cartridge itself very very nice but for those of you who are expecting live resin you're not going to get that for nine dollars for a half gram but overall very very good for your budget cartridge smokers you know if you have nine dollars after you purchase all this stuff and you want to get a cartridge you know i'll definitely recommend this and i'd like to say that nine dollars is the price that i pay in modesto california obviously it's going to be different where you're from even different dispensaries in same cities range different prices so just please just keep that in mind when you're like looking for this car it's not going to be nine dollars if you're not where i'm at you know i'm saying so but yeah blue dream very very good strain from them uh as of right now the probably the best strain that i've tried from papa herbs their cartridges is the gelato but i would say that maybe this is the second best out of all the ones that i've tried i've tried forbidden fruit i've tried wedding cake the consensus with my friends saying that the wedding cake is actually the best but i didn't really like it it's too i don't know i just didn't i mean it's not bad but i didn't enjoy it as much as i would say this or the forbidden fruit one which kind of added like a little pomegranate taste and you guys know like i'm not i don't prefer my cartridges to taste like fruits and all that stuff because it just i think it they don't get me as high when it tastes like fruit it has to taste like wheat to me and it might just be a thing in my brain that kind of just does it's like an anti-placebo or placebo um but yeah it just i don't i don't hate it you know obviously there's some pros to it you know like if i'm smoking this they're just going to think that i'm hitting a blueberry vape or something but yes i do prefer you know when it tastes like the butt itself cannabis derived terpenes instead of fruity terpenes but nonetheless still a really really good buy you know i still this like maybe the the second this is the second time i bought a papa herbs cartridge and it's because it's so affordable and why not you know and uh yeah like like i said in the first pop earth video when it costs nine dollars uh and it's good it's a win-win because at the end of the day it's nine dollars and it's good and even it like it's so cheap you know what i'm saying like even if you did pay nine dollars and it's shitty you just paid nine dollars you know so i'm gonna take one more hit one more no actually two more hits i'm gonna take another one and then i'm gonna show you guys how much smoke i'm actually getting or vape or whatever cheers oh you see don't have that much left but it's been getting me getting me through the week you feel me oh all right let's take start here peace out guys [Music] you", "9NrfoKftne8": "hey what's going on a shrimp keepers it is Wednesday and I wanted to do an update video just basically on the shrimp room some different things I set up a lot going on a lot going on so it's good I'm getting married not this weekend but next weekend so I'm excited about that doing a lot of work on the house a lot of things going on but got to make time for this room so let me show you some tanks and we'll just go from there all right so I always want to shoot this tank first because the Taiwan bees they move the food so quickly as you can see it's already back there but this thing's doing really good there's babies in it there's some on the glass I mean it's just doing really good this again is a good tank edging and see that guy had a hard time molting which is never a good thing you can see I was uh it would be on the left side of him it's kind of pooped out so I don't know what caused that I did do a water change yesterday so maybe the the change in parameters caused him to molt early but he probably won't make it unfortunately that's a really nice shrimp it's not showing up good on camera but a really nice flower head oh well I mean what can you do some of the tanks that I just set up sorry it's not focused I got this one this is a super super tiger tank so super Tigers just have really thick stripes opposed to the real skinny stripes these ones actually have a nice blue tint tomb which is a pretty unique I would say I've never seen it before knee of the tiger shrimp I've ever had so you get some good variation there's only about 13 in here I'm really hoping they they start taking off preying one of them gets buried soon but you know it's one of those things I got a tiger shrimp down here they're just acclimating I got a minute in order I just as I always tell you guys one drip don't tell me don't drip which I know someone comment on this and it's a whole nother conversation but the one time I don't drip is when I they're not shifting breather bags and that's because of ammonia and there's a lot that goes into that but I ought to get into that in a different video these are the oranges I got in I don't know on last week sometime I'm pretty sure yellows yellows look really great um they were imported so I ordered 30 I lost at least at least 12 so far and you know it's just one of those things if 15 of them make it that's pretty good if I get them to breed once that's even better and then I mix in some of my own in hopes that you know maybe don't pregnant one of my own yellow Neos and I can get some better genetics from there but it's one of those things that will just we'll just see what happens the rabbit's nails all in the back and you can see them they're clean the glass this tank I haven't set up yet I mean I set it up I just haven't put anything in it and then I got quite a few setup in the blue rack sit down the bucket this is the new blue dream colony I ordered a hundred of them mix of grades but so far they're doing really really good really happy with the quality and so I got real lucky with this order and uh yeah I mean as you can see like this video is not enhanced at all it's just straight off an iPhone and they're nice dark blue you can always tell after the first month or two after if you know what the quality is because sometimes people will feed them color enhancing pellets or flakes or whatever and they'll get unrealistic colors so so it's always interesting to see what you're going to get with you know after a couple months and with the first the first generation after you get them so it's always interesting I just got these in - they're not going to show up too good on camera but I assure you they're they're extremely nice this is a Konya blue Velvets again I ordered a hundred of them and uh and most of them eat it I I think I only had one death that I know of but you know I'm not going to sit there and count 100 sure him home oh I don't have that kind of time so I just take it for what it's worth and if they shoot me 100 great if they should be more great if they shoot me less and you know shame on them but uh so I just I take their word for it and I mean they look good it looks like there's quite a few and there you can see them they're all dancing around and so so that's always good I mean it's exciting to get healthy shrimp USA bred shrimp from hobbyist and yeah it's just fun that I always say we don't know what to say I always say it's just fun but it is just fun and uh but yeah so this is a really cool tank I'm really excited to see what's going to happen I know there was some huge females in here that they sent and so excited to see if those berry up pretty quickly and then from moving my bucket I apologize if that made a really nasty sound on camera another blue velvet colony there is a huge very female if I could find her I mean one of the biggest I've ever seen yeah there she is so you show come out I mean this chick is huge she's writing this end of the screen it's just the lighting is not great so you can't see her but uh let me see what I'm pulling with my finger she's right there and I just tons of eggs like I would say I would say that mom was carrying 50 eggs at least so I got unfocused but uh yeah so well I'll come back if I if she decides to come out and then I hear I got some more blue Velvets from a different source there's actually there's no bearing ones in here yet but there's some really nice saddled females that they send so that's always a bonus and then over here this is the lower grade blue dreams which I mean there's a there's some other ones and there there's also some really really nice ones and uh yeah there was uh there's quite a few buried females in here there's one right there and it's really exciting to start getting these guys going and then another colony of blue dreams that I just set up as you can see I just fed them that's why they're all congregated but there's a nice buried female so that's I mean whenever you get new shrimp and they bury up within the first month I mean that's it's a huge bonus so it's it's great I'm I'm really pleased with the quality of the shrimp that I've been getting from hobbyists and it's really good to have those connections and be able to start new colonies and and introduce their line into the Hobby make it more more accessible and uh so that's always cool and then let's see I don't have any setup over here I got one set up on the other side and then I have three more orders coming this week I got some more snowballs so I'm getting ready to show you now is uh I moved my own snowball colony to right here it just wasn't doing great um not sure why sorry again about the lighting the lighting here stinks but it would just wasn't doing great so I figured it could use a change I moved it to Iraq this rack against the wall I'm gonna do it as the misc lanius or miscellaneous just neo tank so we'll see what happens with it I'm going to do some snowballs my fiance is really excited about doing carving Riklis and so I just broke down my carving really tank to see what I had left and she's really excited to go through that let me show you I really didn't think I had too many carbon relays in there but it turned out that I had probably I mean I counted and it was it was well over a hundred not pulling out well over huh let me turn my lights but there are some really really nice ones in here but there's some not so nice ones too like these ones but there's definitely enough in there there's a very Corbin release ooh - so it's good I mean she's really gonna be excited about it I'm sure she's watching this video and a shout out to her my fiance it's gonna be cool to be married I think knock on wood she's gonna kill me for that - but uh no it's really good so I'm excited you know have someone that loves shrimp also like I'm really blessed in that aspect so it's really really cool so she's excited to work with these I'm excited that I had some for her to start working with and hopefully we can stabilize some sort of line and because carbon roads are getting harder and harder to find so it'd be really cool to get a nice colony of them going let me do an update on these tanks this is the black tiger orange eye tank I know buried ones yet but there's you know they're growing not not much die-off if any I haven't noticed any but you know there's you always get a few on this tank you got the random horns neo that was just gorgeous my fiancee begged me she's like please put him in the tank and so so she wound up in this tank again this Coney is doing really good like I said you guys killed me on the blue valve or the blue royal blue tiger sale and I barely have any left and so so this is a colony used to have a good 300 shrimp in here and now it's down to probably about 70 if that and then this one down here got pretty annihilated too so I still got enough but um you know enough to rebuild and start breeding so I'm glad that they do really well for me me it's a it's a line that I've had for a really long time and you guys know I talk about them all time so it's really cool I'm glad that a lot more people in the hobby have them I'm lucky that I was able to be a you know decent part of that to grow them and popularity make them more accessible and that's what I hope to do with the rest of the shrimp so it's exciting to get the blues going I got a whole rack of Reds going in I got some yellows hopefully I'd really get yellows and oranges going again and it's really fun to start getting into it focusing in on what I'm good at and trying to do with the excellent so it's going to be it's going to be a cool end of the year hopefully you guys are excited because I got a lot going on I got a lot of tanks were redoing and my deadline is the end year I need this full room all 96 sinks up and going with tons of shrimp and all the tanks and I just need to have it happen so it's going to be exciting to make it happen and it's going to be good to have you guys along for the journey so you guys made a great week out I look forward to showing off this week's Friday's fishroom Friday it's going to be a really cool fish room we're doing a Victorians the guy had some really rare stuff and so that'll be fun to show and then shrimp Saturday you guys request so many different videos I don't know what I'm gonna do but I'm going to do something cool my fiance's family's in town something I'm pulling them be a little busy I you know that's life right we're all busy but I'll try to get a really good one for you guys I'm excited so you guys make it a great week and I'll talk with you soon play", "ahjI-3RIaKs": "[Music] all right this week on Canadians cannabis reviews we have Aurora Blue Dream it's a sativa hybrid from the original blueberry strain created by DJ short in the 1970s or 80s and haze which has been around since the 1960s should be a good strain we look forward to trying it up everybody welcome back to another Canadian cannabis review with Dave and Gavin what's up Dave not too much buddy how about yourself well too much you're trying to have blue dream this week of course and uh yeah it looks like a very very nice strain where I picked it up on Friday at the NSL see and hopefully it uh live up to the hype that's also blue dream back there from the Instagram was using for pictures so that's gonna be excellent and so was blueberry and hey she said yeah blueberry which is a sativa created by DJ short it has a book out which is cultivating exceptional cannabis but it's at a print right now he's known as the Willy Wonka of pop producing early is quite famous buddy it's completely offline so nobody's never seen this guy and you know nobody knows what he's alive or dead or still exists or it doesn't work like a fictional character he could be yeah yeah but you never know I'm very excited to try it anyway it should be good how's your weekend been good very very good um watched you see didn't want to cooking standard things for me absolutely got me to UFC last night was very entertaining a lot of decisions but main event I think there was a not good when Jaime you're a bunch didn't it yeah yeah and in the stomach which seemed done huh no that's what kickin yeah yeah but like no one wants kicked for the heel in the ribs not gonna be a good time no yeah he got the effects yeah very quickly and then this smells delicious as well we smell some of the blueberry sweetness I know for sure it's supposed to be kind of a sweet berry and kind of a piney taste so it's C pining yeah that's what to call him I was gonna say earthy but piney works and then but I think for the rest of the character right it was mainly decision drew yeah yeah absolutely from the prelims all the way through and then I think fortunately it's finally spring like actually got out yesterday sat in the Sun like oh man it was nice and I walked around downtown a bit EF tilled markets I did get to the market yesterday morning it was fantastic it's very busy just you know walk around check things out it's been a while since I've actually been to the market so which one the one up here 21 okay yeah the Keith brewery one that people forget to open is really like the go-to it used to be all the like most of the major vendors from that one moved down to Pier 21 lace when they started that yep they've gone back the clock turn it's dolls now because they've all read on it with the Connors that are attached yet nice that's good I was like the Berk lion I mean it's kind of a like an event an adventure going through the brewery America to nuts all redone oh so that's not all right yeah it doesn't feel like I saw there will be no more nice there's actual signs and not just like handwritten notes telling you to go down this dark but down at the end of their college guys serving pancakes they're great creepiest market ever yeah well I mean it's the oldest one of the others breweries in North America yeah but if I'm a local and I'm feeling unsafe like wondering where I'm going I'm glad they redid it and put in lights and real sign that's fair yes didn't do too much else a lot of roasting and kind of chickens yeah I mean chicken stall gonna make chicken soup today what else you been doing not too much actually you just takin it easy you know what yeah we went disco show on Friday that was fun which are super nice people yeah absolutely there their office is located up on Clyde Street and Halifax across from the Clyde Street I used to be the cloud street liquor store I guess just a dedicated cannabis store now light street weed yeah so uh yeah very nice people very knowledgeable lots of lots of stuff to check out there so if you're in I think that's a Mary Jane's Affiliate store I believe so as well yeah but they sell pipes and papers and nice little selection or everything you could need super knowledgeable staff probably there mainly to educate on their products but I think they could educate on all abilities yeah very knowledgeable I would say and then got some t-shirts there so they do sell limited merchandise but the shirts are incredible quality and it's again super nice people so if you're out there those pop in and say hi doesn't ask them any question you have they'll explain anything that you don't know about the weed which right now turns out to be a lot but we're still learning about including what terpenes are and how they affect things and there's you a lot more to this and I would've ever expected yeah it's not just roll a joint and smoke it and just get high I mean there's you know of course with the different strains and whatnot that are out there now you're gonna get different effects terpenes are gonna affect you differently so this is stuff we're gonna start researching as well alright maybe just remembering a lighter maybe one down here yeah that's a great idea nice great flavor yeah yeah absolutely a little harsh with a no expected well maybe it's just a little driver friend slc well alright but yeah is look tastes a little stronger that's not bad he's got that little throat catch yeah it's not as smooth as some of the other no no for sure but you know I'll let you know anyway it's not bad it's a it doesn't taste bad it's just it's got a stronger kind of smoke hmm and the effects are starting to come on very quickly yeah I do need to remember to sativa do you say it was a hybrid or yeah but no it's locked says say it's a team of you said I read it is a hybrid well according to what I read anyway yeah I mean from blueberry and haze like both both very popular brands and restrains and both been around for decades yeah kind of staples and then DJ short got together and me this yeah yeah he's done some other strains to he's done was a vanilla luna cocoa cush as their haze blue Velvets so you know he's done quite a few other kind of I guess craft weed yeah I guess yet the strains themselves are probably endless because there's so many oh yeah starting points yeah oh very head effects already oh yeah yeah I'm definitely feeling it it's a nice smoke the other thing to consider to it is the day after daylight savings so or an hour shorter on sleep it's not my problem yeah that's exactly what's going on so even though you're losing an hour of sleep well there's no plus side to daylight savings by I I I'm not an advocate at all the shops and the merchants they get to keep their lights on the main street so people yeah you lost an hour of sleep this weekend thanks to Kaiser Wilhelm people think it's for the farmers but it's really not theirs yeah if you have a look for daylight savings from last week tonight it's a good story on YouTube what do they say about this if the farmers don't care yeah cows don't care what time it is not because they're stupid make sense it was an energy-saving measure by the Germans back in 1918 or yeah around the first world war and for some reason people adopted it and it's just carried on since for no reason cuz I thought I had to do with consumerism and lighting up the main streets no no no no because I mean the lights come on regardless it doesn't matter what time you know the Sun goes yeah you move the Sun forward so as you're moving into Christmas it's all dark gonna light off and it looks like Pleasant for people no so all energy savings and [ __ ] us all huh not even energy savings actually there's a 1% increase in energy consumption well but statistics show that what you lose and sleep you make up for in mortal danger because there are actually more accidents than Monday after daylight savings as well so because they're tired and strung out exactly nice it's terrible it is all limb back the Kaiser Wilhelm exactly first world war yep we should have beat who we did what the [ __ ] I know we couldn't repeal daylight savings time no it doesn't make any sense to me I don't know if anybody else can explain a good reason for daylight savings but there you go Jesus that is hitting me like well yeah that's a very strong sativa yeah it is a very strong sativa what is that 22 percent or so yeah twenty one point four but is it it is a heavy hitting twenty one point for or um it's gone right to my head yeah you punish that one off alright we'll see how we're doing in twenty minutes half hour make sure that we're still high oh yeah well we still be hot if we make it back we'll let you know welcome back and so what do you say Dave if I'm still pretty good stone definitely strong yeah I used to me that sounds great absolutely very heady high enjoyable great daytime weed very sativa no I believe cords more what the bottle says and less what the site said more sativa less hybrid yeah good weed it wasn't quite as harsh I'd say Nate in half does that still have any coffee and so it wasn't the best first day what's a nice hot yeah absolutely it's a not for not really for beginners I wouldn't say more experienced smokers will probably enjoy this a lot all right oma slots thank you very much for watching if you enjoy what we're doing like and subscribe if you have any comments feel free to leave them", "ezr4613fBS4": "yo what is up good boy herbalist here today letting these

again here with respect my region today we'll be doing some products from the high road their local company from my side in eastern washington up in deer park washington we got their blue dream here today nice sativa dominant hybrid uh pretty legendary strain along the west coast we got across the blueberry and haze here let's check out what we got so they're calling we got sweet and yummy berry flavor giving you a relaxed feeling that's pretty on par with what you'll hear from blue dream some people will say it's a little more energetic form but usually you'll hear it's a pretty relaxing good easy going strain very popular popular among uh medical patients and stuff like that for various reasons look at that a big old top nug right there good old christmas tree and yeah getting that real sweet berry aromas good good smell nice density too on the nugs which is always great to see especially with the sativa dominance you can sometimes get a little wifey with them um i got my bong here so let's go ahead and break some down see what we got going on [Music] yeah and definitely so i'm liking the cure good dense snugs not too dry though also not too wet easy to break down perfect for rolling up blunt joint packing the bong honestly this is really easy to work with and kind of what i like to see when i'm going for my weed [Music] not as sticky as i would you know like not super sticky but also like not not sticky like this is so far so good on this uh really would just hope for some good clean ash and a good taste so we're gonna see what we can get from the bong and then i also have a joint here to try i like to do the joints for the taste i believe you get a better profile off of those than you do really anything else unless you're smoking dab which i don't have a rosin press so we cannot do that with this all right shout out to high road for the ashtray and the lighter always need those all right we're gonna start with a big old rip see what we can get [Music] nice so super smooth hit like literally not wanting to cough at all um taste is pretty good little berry a little sweet i couldn't get it didn't get like too too much if you know like anything crazy that i haven't had tasted before um really the big thing on that is just how smooth that was that was a really really easy hit to do let's do one more before moving on to the joint see we can get a better look at the ash [Music] ash is still a little black but you know i haven't had a chance to rip it too much i do see some light gray coming on in the corner right there um but really i feel like if i were to keep smoking it it would it would start to turn that light gray white ash that we're looking for just because of how smooth that is that is really like one of the smoothest weeds that i've had hitting this bong that has like i don't want to cough at all uh really good solid in terms of that sense let's go over to our joint now um i like to get a good profile taste on joints i feel like you just get like i said earlier you just get a better overall exp um experience on that and bongs are great for feeling the high enjoy so great tasting the weed yes you can say i'm rich [Music] oh yeah like already that kind of sweeter berry yeah just yummy there's just good overall flavor really coming through on [Music] this yeah that's really nice really good smoke this like good kind of mouth feel to it it just has like the smoke it just kind of it fills your lungs it's very very full body smoke which is always nice i hate when you feel like you're puffing on a joint just to get like a what feels like a fourth of a hit this is coming in really really nice [Music] a very nice ash is graying up now i see again on this again it's so smooth this is been really nice smoking so far so with that based on everything that i've experienced now you know and taking in their packaging and all that into account i'd give this a solid 7.6 i would have to say um it's not like blowing me out of the water in terms of other blue dreams that i've had it is a strain that i'm sure like many of us i know i've smoked a lot of it i've had other cuts that i would feel are definitely maybe a little more potent on the high a little more quick sitting but in terms of the quality of the smoke the taste how smooth it was if it was flushed well i can see we're getting good gray ash on the joints so i believe it was flushed very well and their branding is cool pretty simple straight to the point which is i do like that they don't uh show off a lot on the side so it's kind of hard to tell um who they are maybe but that does allow them to show case their bud which so far we've seen nothing but big old nugs so why not want to show those off there's the top of their jar nothing crazy pretty simple so i would have to say yeah 7.6 all with everything in consideration and uh yeah that'll wrap it up i'm gonna have a few more products coming from these guys we got some other buds here we got us reviews so stay tuned and get ready to check it out go watch the full review on other reviews on the respect my region [Music] youtube", "xdYCiInyXyo": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] what is your

put the axe to them I'll try to get some pictures of them after I turn the blue light off so we can see what color they are but naturally incandescent sort of say LED lights that are incandescent

so this is another three chive delta eight vape cartridge review the last one that i did did so well that i just well i had to do another one if i release a video and it gets 800 hits or 800 views in a for like a week oh yeah i'm definitely doing another video so the one that i got is blue dream and it's a one milliliter container brand new sealed and that's how i like it and you can see right there it contains 95 percent eight delta eight th oil and then five percent of [ __ ] which you know whatever i guess you gotta i guess it can't be a hundred percent or it would probably just knock you on your ass and stuff uh the directions remove the silicone cover and screw into the battery do not over tighten take one puff and wait 20 minutes wow wait 20 minutes um usage is between one and two puffs let's see here i'm trying to focus it for you guys i can't focus it whatever uh says do not operate any machinery while using this product do not use if pregnant nursing or under the age of 21 this may cause a positive drug test well no [ __ ] oh my god uh let's see here if you need more typical usage it's one or two puffs do not operate wait a minute where's that one part at wait 20 minutes before determining if you need more oh okay 5 10 battery 100 percent hint driving contains 0.3 is that a 9 thc batch 6 out of 15 2021 batch id three chives fishery blah blah blah blah all right blue dream sweet so i have a couple other ones over here these are the fx these are delta eight fx cartridges um and i designed this little thing to keep them in the upright for me because sometimes i'll run out and these right here will be enough to get you by for a few days especially if you leave them in the upright these are this was like orange crush and like granddaddy purple if i remember correctly i didn't really care um for the granddaddy purple i do want to say one thing though there is a big difference between the ethics cartridge and the delta eight cartridges i feel like the delta eight cartridges these are put together better they just seem to be i don't know i don't have any leakage they hardly ever clog they just seem to be a better cartridge than the fx the fx are also a lot cheaper too these are like 30 something dollars and these are like 60 something dollars okay now the effects of this all right let's say you're sitting on the couch smoking a blunt there you go you're going to get high but this is great because you can be out public you could be in a mall walking around hitting this and people are just going to think that you're vaping and that's the beautiful part about it and it delivers i mean just one one good hit delivers like a serious bond grip i mean it's depending on your tolerance and how much you smoke it can get you really really really really really high um like for instance i got friends that do not smoke like me i consider myself to be a pothead meaning that i i blaze it up every day we smoke it down okay that's just me i've been like that for 20 years um but we're not talking about me this i hit it one time and i'm like whoo all right if i get somebody that doesn't smoke like me and they hit it they gotta sit down and sometimes they're out for the count like uh like i actually had one friend hit it and it ruined her whole night she felt like [ __ ] it just messed her up and then i had another buddy uh i mean it put his ass on the couch so i guess the effects is just different depending on who you are and how much you smoke but let me tell you what it's definitely worth it it's discreet nobody knows that you have it plus there's no smell like you blaze that [ __ ] up man you hit it pow pow pow you get a big old dragon's breath cloud and it don't smell like weed it's awesome you can take it to work that's the best part about it man is that there's no paraphernalia there's no weed nobody knows you have it on you the only way somebody's gonna know you have it is if they physically see it no smells man i i've been pulled over by the police and i had this on me he didn't even ask me not clean as a whistle goodbye give me my ticket leave awesome these things definitely have their benefits definitely and if you're going to have this you got to have a 510 battery okay this is an e-leaf very simple 510 battery plugs into the bottom i don't know an hour charge you're good to go all you do is you hold the button wait for it to get to about there and then you start hitting it hit it slow you're not trying to rip on it you're just trying to take a slow even deep breath and even that might be too much for you three child blue dream now one thing i did like about it was all they had so many selections for these and then they told you about what they did like this is a sativa brand um this is supposed to give you clarity um it's not supposed to make you foggy it's supposed to give you energy and make you awake and whatever whatever whatever like it claims what it is it's a um a sativa synthetic it's a blend of you know indica and this brand i mean like it tells you what they are and what they're mixed with their strands and everything so you really can't go wrong so it's not like you don't know what you're buying you know what i mean sorry if there's a little bit of an echo i'm trying to do this privately this is illegal in my state you know so you really don't want to be advertising what you're doing that's the other thing like a cop a cop knows what this is because this does not look like a typical vape that's the other thing that you need to be aware of this is very identifiable if they're a cop and they deal with this [ __ ] they've seen this before they will know exactly what you have in your hand so be aware of that uh your average person not so much you know i mean you go out for a cigarette break you hit it once or twice nobody's going to even say it or even notice it but be careful because police they they probably will know what the hell that is i mean because all vape cartridges come the same basically the same look you know all right we're actually starting to get to the meat and potatoes oh come on [ __ ] come on out now here's another thing i like is that they come with these uh get out damn it [ __ ] it's pressure treated uh is that they come with these plastic things right to keep them covered now when i transport mine for instance see like these these even have it on them when i transport them because sometimes i'll take this with me and then i'll take another flavor with me it's very important that you keep that cap on there all right because if you don't keep that cap on there lint and trash and garbage and other things that are in your pocket will get into these little holes and ports and you don't want that because that's going to mess everything up for you so it's very important that you keep these little plastic covers and if you want to even keep the mouthpiece because you know see like this mouthpiece see all the stuff that's in there that's from it being in my pocket like lint and trash and other things get up inside of that you know what i mean yeah you don't want that that's bad so definitely keep your plastic covers man you got to keep those and try to store it upright because if you laying it down you can take a good chance of it leaking and it'll this [ __ ] takes forever it's like molasses to go back in the upright um but let's let's plug it in and check it out not only that check out the quality this is the end cap that came off of the uh the new delta eight cartridge see it see how thick it is all right and then this is the end cap that comes now i ain't trying to knock the the fx vapes i'm just trying to justify the 30 something dollars more that they want for the vape you know [Music] all right and then here's theirs see what i'm saying see the difference look at the difference in the caps big difference this one's nice and meaty and this one's real thin and kind of cheesy looking but uh you know i guess that's part of the difference is that you get better coverage with it also when i bought these these just come in like kind of like this thing here uh but it doesn't have anything covering the mouthpiece the mouthpiece is wide open so but with these you get a mouthpiece covered which is nice because like i said i transport these in my pocket and stuff so yeah you know what that um this this right here it kind of it kind of sneaks up on you god damn oh my god i'm sweating look i'm sweating can you see my head look at my head look that was one hit one hit how do i look do i look like i've been like i'm high do i look high yeah one hit y'all one hit damn yeah see i can go in there right now smoke a few bowls that [ __ ] won't get me like how i am right now good god oh [ __ ] all right yes um forgot what i was saying yep don't remember now okay so back to what i don't remember i was talking about y'all need to get this i don't know what else to tell y'all three chive delta eight vapes leave me a comment subscribe to my channel check out my other videos i build computers and do all kinds of custom water cooling and technology stuff so you all need to come and check that out check out my channel i appreciate y'all for watching", "snnh2s6s6jA": "hey there welcome to the secret history living inside your aquarium and my aquarium as well this is Alexander Williamson and I am showing you a shrimp giving birth now this happens to be a neo caridina de vida shrimp also known as the Blue Dream shrimp and you're immensely lucky to catch this point of view if you can ever because this female shrimp loop there goes one baby I don't know if you caught that because she is buried up if you can see those berries a little clearer when i zoom out and she's at the perfect angle for us to see she is behind a piece of glass which is warping things a little bit but her side flank armor on that you're looking through the translucent blue there goes another little one is completely right now it's completely clear she isn't a dark blue color she's been on a lighter substrate lately or at least medium colored substrate so kind of interesting but you're watching her actively give birth to the last of her eggs and you can see she's still jostling them for oxygen and things but it almost looks like she is having a slightly tough time now there is a nother you can see a baby shrimp in there with her that is one this one walking here to the left of her that is one from probably a week ago so you can see the size difference we're talking about here between the eggs and the mother shrimp now it's it appears that she probably has maybe 20 to 30 eggs and right now she's probably get oh there goes another one I don't know if you can catch these if you're seeing them like I am as well but basically it just looks like a little floaty thing going off into the water and she's helping them undo there they're the egg casing and basically letting them out and they they either float away lightly or they still have the remainder of their shell of sorts and that shell then floats down to the bottom in between the substrate here and you know that's where they wherever they land is where they end up and then they'll lay low in the substrate for sometimes up to a week and they'll live off of some of what was inside of them and in the eggs and then they'll go searching for food all the meanwhile kind of searching for our folks and bacteria and fungi that help them help them I guess eat in the in the meanwhile as they're still in this sort a semi larval stage although neo caridina shrimps are considered a higher-order shrimp meaning they give live birth now if you have these shrimp or you're curious about them they are the exact same shrimp species wise as the cherry shrimp and they are a selective breed or or morph visual difference of the as I said neo caridina David eye as well as it's possible that parliament palma pal mata or Zhang and menses I believe it is pronounced also have some bloodlines shared in the hobby amongst some breeders although the Neo Karenina de vida is what is commonly accepted and assumed to be the majority of the blood in these blue dream shrimp now these come from the darker morph of the natural type of shrimp and they come from a chocolate shrimp which then starts putting off a blue morph but also interestingly enough neo caridina blue shrimp are probably the most common route that can be morphed to now I know that that statement sounds confusing but essentially what I'm saying is that and now you can see see she's tossing a couple eggs around which is getting the mold off of them you can see towards the back there she has a little pearl or ball that she's working right now she's just pushed it up forward again and it has it was circular now it is no longer circular and it is looking more like a baby curled up shrimp than a perfectly round ball and so she's helping undo that and it's really quite magical to watch them do this and they they can feel clearly they're not looking at it they can feel which little shrimp need help they're not just dropping these eggs to fend on their own necessarily now they do accidentally drop them from time to time and I've seen that happen also especially when they're really full or or stressed or startled really full of eggs that is but this is a proper birth happening where she was full earlier today and there should still be another female who is full to the brim but oftentimes you'll also find that groups of shrimp give birth together and also get pregnant or buried together but yeah she she's using those back Schwimmer ATS those legs on her side that are next to the armor plating on on her which is purely defensive obviously she's using those one to aerate the eggs and move them around so they don't develop any mold and then two to keep them safe and with her and three to kind of polish off the edges so to speak and and work on opening them as they're naturally hatching also and then to sort out which ones are still in there and need a little bit of help versus which ones are good to go so I'm going to try to clear away some of the over the the what do we want to call it here the the water the stuff on top of the water and oh just so happens that one of the other pregnant is making an appearance very pregnant female Bluebird Balti also right you can see her eggs are slightly different color so we've got this cool shot kind of well focus for you guys but we've got the big female all very pregnant here with the one who is just getting rid of the last few eggs as we're watching this now this process can take a matter of probably a half hour or it can take days I've seen some pregnancies last or be split up into like a week that's not as common but it does happen where they had some eggs that were probably more ready more developed and they let them go earlier so right now what she's doing is she's got to work those eggs out and it's interesting to notice in this female she's very healthy and you can tell that even though with her color you might assume is she missing some sort of nutrients or something she's very translucent part of that is the stress at night also shrimp if you turn their light the light off a lot of times they look less vivid than in the day and they have the ability either consciously or unconsciously as a reaction to change the the color in their flesh and some of them on their exoskeleton it'll have like be actually a color as well making it look even more intense when their flesh is that color on top of that now if you happen to find a passed away or deceased blue shrimp oftentimes at first they'll be a pale blue but then they'll sometimes be a pink to clear color so that's just kind of an interesting side note but as we're watching her she's got the other female now with her so this is kind of fascinating I don't know what what is going on here they're right behind the brim of this this glass which is frustrating because I would rather try to film for you guys and maybe you know what I'm going to this is just too interesting of a spectacle also another pregnant female that wants to come by and say hey she just gave birth yesterday is one of the Balti shrimp just swam by and again while we're waiting for the last of the pregnancy to clear out you can see on the walls some of the blue dream shrimp that came out last week and they already have a nice deep blue to kind of a clearish gray color which is not the same in every strain so blue dreams as I was saying before I kind of got excited myself also have the most number of routes genetically to get to their their coloration so blue dreams have been created they can happen in the wild a mutation that causes a blue shrimp not nearly as blue as these usually but just like lobsters and crabs in shellfish for some reason or another that is one of the prominent occurrences of colors that can happen okay here we go we're gonna try to move this a little and now hopefully we'll have a less obstructed view so they can either mutate from a wild state which is usually like a clear color or a striped red as the natural cherry shrimps and that's a talking very pale stripe like there is probably a a baby over here that I could show you that would look something more like a wild a wild shrimp with the red tendencies not even these are our pale enough but something along the lines of you see that little greenish one there the wild ones have that clear color and like back in here here's one they have a clearish color and some of them are brown some of them are black and others are darker brown but they all are some variation of that now from those four main phenotypes that we distinguish they usually are talking about blue dream shrimp are coming from the Shoko line whereas blue velvet shrimp come from another line possibly now this is all a little contentious in the different breeders say different things a lot of it was very proprietary when these were new and people were paying you know $100 a shrimp search for blue shrimp when they were new to the world but essentially you had some random just one-in-a-million occurrences and when people started keeping cherry shrimp cherry red shrimp like we were just looking at some of those once in a while you'd get a blue one and they'd select those and they'd bring them over and over and now we have these world-class quality like this one here which is this one is from Lucas Bratz so these are considered the truest blue Blue Dreams in the world they are supposedly and seemed to be to me as well have the most consistent blue they don't need much calling as in you see how blue this female is here she is just a beautiful regal blue and her organs inside of her are the only thing that really separates how how much blue there is whereas this is the lightest end of the scale but I must say too that as we're watching the end of this pregnancy so something spooked her there probably a Hydra or some sort of small little creature in in the in the substrate there you see that one behind over there to the left just jumped there could be some little little critter in there that's that's stinging them or you know startling them but the colors can come from the darker chocolate color shrimp and that brown is actually made up of a mixture of red and blue as well as some yellow pigments and black all together and a brown or tan and then also the dark red believe it or not the Bloody Marys within their line and it's debatable whether they had blue crossed into Radigan or whether the red just happened to cross out of the blue but a lot of the deeper reds and I'm gonna pull away here in just a moment when I make sure that she's not about to vote see she just kicked that egg back to the very back of her body there and she might be kicking it out I think we're gonna see it here I'm sorry it's grainy that she just dropped one into the substrate so that'll be a baby that she's just let's be but basically yes so she is almost done it looks like maybe there's one two three eggs left up in there in her midsection right by that dark spot in in her abdomen and her color is starting to return to now that color is lighter for several reasons one being stressed two being the time of day three being nutrients and four being that she is you know she's giving birth so right here you can see the other pregnant female who is pregnant and hers probably some of her color has left her body because she's giving that nutrients to her young she's giving that extra you know calcium or carotene I you know to be quite honest I don't know what elements go into pigmentation of the the blue pigmentation specifically but you can see the other female not quite as far along the eggs are smaller a little different color they're kind of a mustard color and I've seen these eggs be everything from a reddish brick hue to mustard - almost whitish to neon yellow and green with fuzzy green indicating a fungal bacteria where you will lose the eggs but yeah so the the blue line comes from there it also comes from pearl blue pearl Motta's and over here if we pull away for a minute let's see if any of the real dark cherry shrimp are around but here's a normal cherry shrimp nice and bright red you know typical vibrant there you go really red like just blazing red but if we take a look at let's get some other ones flushed out of here like this gal here she actually has blue pigment that allows her to look like a darker red but it's really blue pigment it doesn't turn into purple like mixing paints these darker ones are closer to a Bloody Mary which just means that the actual pigmentation within their flesh and in their skeleton in their exoskeleton actually has hues of blue in it so this process can go on all night so I won't bore you with it but I just wanted to kind of show you the actual process and it's almost interesting here that you know are these two pregnant females are they are they feeling for each other or is the other one coming to aid is there something I don't know like maybe there's some sort of afterbirth or she'll go like casing that she ends up eating from the other one I don't know but it's rather interesting and the other females have chosen to stay fairly far away and the football team who just gave birth the female just gave birth the other day are just zipping around the tank way more than usual which I don't know the reason for that but I do know that when a a shrimp has a saddle which is let's see if we've got one with a saddle that's real clear anywhere in sight but it's it's their ovaries and it's you see that yellow that looks like guts up in her head that will turn into a longer dip or what we call saddle full of eggs and then it will come it will head down her her spine so it will start up up here and it'll head down the spine and then she'll get fertilized and the eggs will drop down now I think what it is is an opening opens under the tail there and then the the male shrimp can fertilize but right now the female is in the very last process from what I've observed in the past and she is opening up the side armor she's flexing those panels that's why she shedded right before she before she buried up they often do that if you notice to your female shrimp are all getting new coats they'll hide because they're delicate for a week after that or so and then usually they'll proceed to become married and pregnant so looks like we're down to the very last maybe two or three eggs in there like I was saying and she's juggling them you can make out let's see oh there goes another one into the substrate she's got one hanging out from under her belly and she's gonna flick it out you see the yellow it's very interesting some of them have different colors come on focus blue come on focus got a of course the focus is screwed up at the last second all right but so now she's got this little yellow one and is she gonna flick it out of her body or store it back up because it's not ready it's definitely standing out and she has it internally I can tell that even though the camera can't she's probably trying to get the last little bits of the peel of the egg and then get rid of it now it could be that that one that's yellower than all the other ones inside of her it could have a mold on it and she could be determining whether she can clean that fungus off or whether it's too far gone and she just disposes of it in order to not infect the others out of habit even though there aren't really other eggs to infect at this point it's over so I'm gonna leave you here because we could be here for another hour or two for all I know but I hope you guys learned a little something I hope you enjoyed watching this and this was the miracle of life miracle of birth with blue dream neo caridina shrimp related to cherry shrimp and they're just given birth it's around midnight they tend to do it in the evening I've noticed probably when predators are less present to eat the babies usually they do it somewhere a little more hidden but clearly they feel fairly relaxed here and there comes the final eggs right there as we're closing out the video one just dropped right in between the track the cracks there's two left and one looks like it might be coming out and the other one she's definitely what she's doing with those little swimmer rats on her is she's assessing are those still good eggs or don't do I not bother so that's what's going on here there goes another little guy and let's see here that one came out white which is interesting it's already hidden but they'll hide for the first week sometimes up to three and then they'll come out now if conditions are very bad they can hide for like a month and not grow very fast but if you have good conditions like this tank the algae and the beneficial bacteria you'll get these babies who you can see are substantially smallest smaller than the adults still but they'll come out despite it being in the wide open they'll come out so now she's gonna be exhausted after she finishes here and it looks like so this wasn't I'm not thinking that this is a baby that she had walking around next to her I think that is still one of the older shrimp 'lets because usually they're a little more clear at this stage and it takes some a couple hours at least to color up but I could be wrong that could have been a large one that was stuck way up by her shoulder and in stomach and intestines but I'm gonna assume it's one of the other one of the other old ones so if you guys learn something like this if you want to help me get a better camera so I can zoom in on this really clearly and talk about the biology evolution the science the history and just you know hopefully help you guys out understanding these processes and maybe doing some troubleshooting for instance if she had gotten stuck here or had passed away I would know that I could cut her open very gently and those shrimp would probably be fine just sitting on the sponge filter for the evening since they were coming out tonight anyways but the eggs can also be placed into an egg tumbler which I can show you in another video how you can make those with just an air air hose and well an air pump I supposed to and a little container or a valve so I hope you guys are all doing well I hope your fish shrimp there doing well and hopefully this female recovers from the stress of pregnancy you can see that both of them already have new saddles forming that yellow there that can also be their gut or food in their intestines their brain and all that all packed into there although I want to say that their brain out there comes another baby right there so I don't know if you saw that but it's just gonna lay there so rather teeny tiny little shrimp late' and now we've lost her behind the Tupperware fog there comes another one if you just saw that so that's probably the last two right there so she's probably done now and she'll go find a place to hide and rest and she could be resting for several days after this and this female is next in line to have that happen now I think that this shrimp who just appeared out of nowhere right here this blue one next to the orange rock by the edge in the bottom corner of your screen that is one of the new ones and it does have that much pigment kind of just depends on how well form they are so there's no fish in this tank no fear of or anything like that and they can just focus on growing but I hope that this channel and this information has helped you guys learn something it's been interesting and you know maybe it saved you money each of these shrimp babies theoretically it could be worth you know whatever 10 bucks or five bucks depends where you live 3 bucks in your up or you know 20 bucks in the Midwest somewhere where there's no pet shops but I'd pay you know about about 9 or 10 bucks for a good quality blue dream shrimp and you know those babies coming out if they all died that's theoretically two to four hundred dollars dying on you not to mention it sad but hopefully this channel knowledge information in general is power and maybe if that helps you and you save that money you save those shrimp you feel good about it any number of things like that on my channel and it's worth it to you I really appreciate when people help me out on patreon and make a donation

selected to let you know when new material is released in the drop-down menu otherwise it doesn't automatically do that anymore so that is the half hour birth here comes the very last egg trying to come out trying to get flicked out I think this one may have mold on it because it is a bright bright green which you can't see on your screen but I'm seeing it you probably see in an orange or yellow ish color but that that happens sometimes where a few of the eggs just sit and she can't get to him and clean them all but it's really a miracle thank you for watching take care take care of the people around you the critters around you and yourself and I'll talk to you next time good night", "3jqe5KGD9lI": "what's going on everyone Tanner here and in this one we're going to finally set the blue dream shrimp free into their new home which I'm really excited about I also wanna update you on the bettas tank real quick and I'll show you some new critters that I got first things first let's get these shrimp into their new home of course that's easier said than done though if you remember from last week's video I told you that I didn't like the aquariums current location I also needed to build the second terrarium shelf to quickly accommodate both needs I finally stepped up to the plate in both the second terrarium shelf which I think turned out great [Music] before moving it though I wanted to install the light on the new rack if your call I had it zip tied on to the wire shelf previously but this time I used some sturdier hardware as such I made a few measurements screwed in two hooks and use chains to hold up the light in case you're wondering this is just an LED sharp light it was cheap it's bright it does a decent job of growing plants and overall I think it's a good budget light my only complaint with it is that while filming it has a slight LED flicker anyways I'll leave a link to it down in the video description for personal reference now on to the aquarium itself since it's only ten gallons it'll be fairly easy to move of course we'll start out by unplugging the filter after that I drained about five gallons of clean water into a bucket I say clean water because the aquarium is fairly clean and I like to keep some amount of the original water when moving my aquariums if possible [Music] next I carefully scraped the front of the glass with the razor blade to remove the biofilm and organics after doing so the rest of the water was then drained into a discharge bucket while doing so I cleaned up the sand sucked up any dead plants and removed everything that I just scraped off the glass draining the water in this order allowed me to remove excess organics and keep some of the original water since I'm using established water it's basically like I'm just doing my weekly maintenance and water change at this point the aquarium was good to be moved before setting it onto the rack though I put down two sheets of coroplast which I was using on the previous shelf to help evenly distribute the aquarium's weight I figured I might as well use them again so that I could determine exactly where I wanted to place the aquarium's I suppose they will also help distribute the weight but they're really not needed on a shelf like this with the rm2 Quarian it's also worth mentioning that throughout this process I've been spraying the plants with a mr. so that they didn't dry out anyways let's get the aquarium up and running once more I placed the dish in the aquarium to minimize disruption from the water and filled it up with the established tank water [Music] then I filled the rest up with clean dechlorinated tap water until the aquarium was completely full [Music] now we're ready for the shrimp I'm currently keeping them at room temperature which is somewhere between 74 and 76 degrees Fahrenheit the aquarium is exactly the same temperature so it's not a concern however the water parameters of their current setup are slightly more acidic than the new setup so we're going to drip acclimate I would have done this anyways though because shrimp are fairly sensitive to abrupt changes in water parameters to do so I'm using an airline tube and a valve to slowly dilute the water that they are currently in with tank water the valve will allow me to control the frequency of the drip and thus the speed at which they are acclimated I set it up for a very slow drip that took about two hours to fill up their bin I know that sounds like overkill but slow dilution of water will make for a safe transition into the new aquarium and I don't want to take any chances [Music] after that amount of time the shrimp were carefully netted and set free into their new home [Music] by the way I got these shrimp from lrb aquatics whenever he came to tour the animal room I will admit that these are from his be team but regardless they are still some pretty high quality shrimp anyways I'll leave a link to his channel down in the video description I'm really happy with how this tank is turning out and I'm glad to have finally added the shrimp I made just things down the road and I will add more inhabitants in time but right now I'm content let me know what you think about the progress of this down in the comments I also want to update you on my betta I was reading through all of the comments and a few of you dropped the name Casper I felt like it was a nice name that suited him well so I went for it Casper's tank is doing really well since I manually removed the algae didn't delight and added the Amano shrimp I also turned up the flow slightly but I didn't mention that in the previous video after doing so the shrimp thoroughly cleaned the aquarium in a matter of days and it looks very clear for my experience Amano shrimp are incredible cleaning up a tank and they'll keep it clean most of the time as well plus they're super fun to watch overall though I'm really liking the progress of the setup and I figured I'd do a quick update to tell you that I chose a name I also want to adopt hol G situation so that you can see how simple and quick it can be to fix it of course the situation will be different for every aquarium and based on the type of algae but if you can pinpoint and fix the root cause it's nothing to be afraid of understand also that everyone gets algae it's just a matter of winning the battle against it now I want to show you some new fish that I got for the fire-bellied toads pallid Arian yes you heard me right fish for this pallid areum for those of you who are observant or who follow me on instagram you already know about these I wanted to do a proper introduction though on here as well I know I said I didn't want to do this initially but I figured I owe it to myself and each of you to give it a try allow me to explain for those of you who don't know fire-bellied toads are poisonous as such keeping anything else with them is a risky practice that I didn't want to advocate but it can be done shortly after I released the video on this build I noticed that snails started to appear they are breeding and doing well so I decided to add some Malaysian trumpet snails as well as time went on they continued to thrive and reproduce along with the other snails all those snails are pretty tolerant of various conditions I got to thinking that it may be possible to keep fish or other critters in here as well eventually I made my way to a local fish store that was some feeder Whitecloud Mountain minnows for 20 cents of piece at that price I figured I'd give it a try especially since white clouds are well suited for this environment so I bought a few and gave it a try thankfully it worked out well the fish seemed to really like this setup based on their behaviors I haven't seen any casualties and I think it's difficult for the toads to eat them however I have seen them hunting here and there and I'm sure if the opportunity is right they will succeed to address this I'll get some type of floating plant to provide better coverage for the fish so this is less of an issue if you do some research online about keeping fish with fire-bellied toads you will see mixed results generally leaning toward favorable outcomes in my case I only have three toads and there's a lot of water so I suspect whatever poison could be in the water is extremely diluted regardless off to monitor this long-term and let you know how it turns out understand that I'm not advocating this behavior and that if you choose to do the same do so to your own discretion anyways I'm glad that I got them for this setup because they add a whole new dynamic as well as a lot of life to the water feature white clouds are peaceful so stick to themselves and are an attractive fish plus they have some interesting behaviors and are fun to watch more on them in a future video though expect to see a lot more of the shrimp tank the betta tank in the fire-bellied toads pallid areum in the future they're all still progressing and taking shape so there's much more to come also don't forget about that other aquarium to the right of this one that I'll be setting up very soon I have something truly unique planned for this one that I know you're going to love now that we've both terrarium shelves done we can also move on to some cool terrarium builds as always if you liked the video and haven't done so already give it a thumbs up and leave a comment down below thank you so much for tuning in and I'll see you in the next one peace", "dfzCLcajozc": "hello guys welcome to mark's shrimp tanks uh today i thought we'd do some culling in the blue dream tank because i'm doing anyway in my room i'm doing some things as i always do and you know guys i thought to myself when i see videos on youtube or the stream of my blue dreams i see them better on the stream or the video than i do in real life right so today i'm going to use this camera it's my mobile phone does it look okay this is just to give you an idea of the shrimp that's in the tank i'm going to take um a couple of little scoops of water and put it in my jug you can't see this because it's above the top you'd hear it put a couple in and then we can start to look at what we're going to take out of this tank because uh yeah i can see all kinds of different shrimp in here now and we want to try and keep this one uh true a little bit now the good thing with this camera as well guys is um it is very good with macro shots and stuff so let me give you an example if it plays ball today um i can kind of zoom in reasonably close um on the camera will allow you to see all the variations and stuff like this i mean this is quite a quite a nice little picture right but just for the beginning you can already see there's quite a few calls in here uh we're going to go back out just a tad so you can see the neck going in the water and what not and guys when i'm doing my blue dream tank um anything that isn't really blue should come out the tank race so i don't mind if it's a black shrimp that's in the tank because often what will happen is the black shrimp isn't actually black it's just a very dark blue right so those ones can stain if it's brown or it's red or if it's clear or anything that isn't blue blue will be coming out the tank right so let's get our net this one here big giant net let's get you in the tank and uh the thing that i see first off the bar here guys is brown shrimp i can see quite a lot of brown so i'm just going to skirt the pack a little bit like we do we talked about before scar the park come on wave over triplets uh the food today is a protein mix let me see god it's so hard for me to see with my eyes guys you could probably see like perfectly with the camera here ones here's one here look a little face debugger if it goes to the bottom you will see it come a little face debugger it's a brown shrimp i think come on don't want to crush these little mother efforts come on go down you can see it sounds like brown oh it's actually looks like it's red in this picture right so let's get you out of here let's see what else we can see i'm looking for uh things that look like they're carbon really's as well anything that is not like a solid blue guys it needs to come out the tank when i looked in here today before i start doing the water change i could see quite a few little red babies as well so we can spot anything that is red we'll have to take them out the tank as well i think this one here is red or brown chocolate so if we had another tank this would be perfect for you see there so this one here little chuckle they don't want to come out let me see what else is a really here oh really there now this one looks like a uh blue really or something you see it see how is the blue in the body but his head and his heels red let me see what else can we see in here i'm going to use the camera as much as i can i think this one is brown get out the net please there you go and of course these guys will be going in the call tub call container the tater salary homing center as we like to see who else is there this one's brown i think maybe a little bit blue it's not blue blue so it can come out as well let me see hey guys i'm going to start to use the camera a little bit more because uh it's very very hard for me to tell the difference with my naked eye bullocks let me see you guys are like mark that one there mark that one there oh my god guys i just cannot see a thing so everything there looks kind of blue doesn't it kind of blue i'm guys i'm looking for the red ones because i did see a couple of red ones in here today i want to get them out of the tank come on little brown burgers guys let's see if i can uh let's see if i can move this around a little bit i don't know why it's going into focus there god damn yeah there you go i think i have on on manual focus that's probably why let's see if we can have a little look around where are you that one there is very dark to see but i think it might be blue so yeah as you can see if i pick it up with the net you'll see so we me with the naked eye bollocks here for example i would think that that is why is it not focusing i would think that that is a black shrimp i think i might have it on like manual focus or something here just switch that off i do i have a manual so see that's a very nice shrimp very very nice all right maybe i should use the plus or minus button here you go learning curve guys learning curve you can see here you can see that shrimp has blue in it as well so but there's there's more brown in this shrimp than anything else see the one in the center let's get you out of here there's actually lots of shrimp in the night now three this one i can't make my mind up guys let's see i have to see it with my naked eye bollocks i'm not if i'm not sure i'm gonna remove it so we have let me see one two three four five six seven eight only eight shrimp taken at this tank where's the red ones that i saw before i just see one that looked like uh uh red really but of course it wasn't this one of me really really so small i can't tell this one looks like a choco or something doesn't it but it's so black it's very hard to tell but guys this is the life of the shrimp keeper especially with neocaridina you're um going to be culling these guys constantly if you have a call tub you'll be laughing i think this one here is brown on this side this one might be brown let's see [Music] see can i zoom in on this little bugger or auto thingamajig you'll have to get used to the this stuff i can't tell if this is grown or not you could tell that that one that's just jump in the net is blue and the one below is blue so this one might be blue i cannot tell so it's going to come out all the same even chuck it out come on shrimp get it oh it's no i'm not chucking these guys out this one looks brown that i can see it with my eyes up here more brown please there's one there this is what i was looking for before this little fella he says clearly a cull clearly so that was the one i was wanting to get out of the tank today stuck in the net let's see is there anyone else quickly looking over the tank guys let's see is there anyone else is there anyone else you see look at the barking stuff here there's there's a decent amount of shrimp everywhere in the tank i have no doubt if we kept on recording uh we'd find more but i don't know how valuable you guys find this kind of video is this one brown over here this one yeah it is brown choco i don't know how valuable you find these type of videos where i'm actually just doing something in the shrimp room and uh recording as i go along let me guys let me know in the comment section if you find this at all helpful so much weed in this time guide let's go back over here you know what this will do as well for me guys is it will allow me to more or less tell if the ones i see that are black if they're brown because when i'm looking at this tank here uh i simply just can't tell i can't tell what color it is close close unless i look at the camera like this right so see i can't really see anything that's standing out anymore in here yep nothing at all i don't think there is anything there is it would be like the old struggler let me see i'm just going to quickly have a little stir in the bark lots and lots of wheat lots and lots of baby shrimp you see the baby shrimp in the net already see i can't really see anything else i'm just looking for stuff that might save me um removing shrimp in the future because if there's a big buried female in here that's red obviously i don't want her to have her young attack yeah there you go i think that is it for now all right farm let's get these shrimp over to the tear salad rehoming center um i probably will drip these but i won't bore you with me dripping them guys what we can do though is just to see if this helps we'll put this container onto a white surface and we'll see if we can really really notice the difference in the shrimp if i use the camera to zoom in a little bit right so let's get over here um yeah you can see i can see like that one that's dead center is brown definitely now that one there is brown as well so i think this is not too bad you can see the difference in the colors and whatnot here okay shrimp farm hope you enjoyed today's show um it's not been the most spectacular video of all time but um you learn things from boring videos like this sometimes as well please like and subscribe if you haven't already guys and i love you all i'll catch you in the next one happy chunky", "KxdXfPcW2DQ": "hey guys this is chanel at wiki Lee and today we're gonna talk about Blue Dream Blue Dream is a 50/50 hybrid with THC levels maxing out at almost 26% popular for its high THC value Mersin levels an incredible blueberry flavor this strain is commonly used for pain control total body relaxation and euphoric blitz from novices to connoisseurs this strain is popular among the masses receiving a 4.7 out of 5 stars on wiki lead I personally found Blue Dream to be extremely beneficial for relaxation both body and mind it's great for either a day out or a night in I give Blue Dream 5 out of 5 stars just want me to like a snippet that's really good very good it's very like fruity but also just like a hint of thyme basically like everything that I want cannabis to smell like is just like happening right in this nug that's good it's very good", "iMnR3LjFUFs": "what's going on guys and welcome back to my fish tank vlog behind me you can see the new racking system it's looking great one side we've got shrimp at the moment and some killifish and some nano fish as well and the other side we just got some plants being stored but not forever because that would be a very expensive plant rack wouldn't it yes a quick little recap for those of you that aren't aware so in here i've got this amazing pair of killifish if it focuses which it has there you go look at that stunners absolute stunners male and female oh no the lights have gone off well that won't do i have to get them back on hang on and we're back in action so yeah we've got the liar tails and i couldn't pronounce them before but you guys said that's how it's pronounced so if it's wrong sorry liar tails in that one crystal red shrimp in this one next to it they are doing great not seen any babies yet but tons of malts going on melts are the shells that surround their body when they grow out of them they just pop them off and then they do it again until they're massive like this one here the goliath right in the middle there what a beast anyway so i haven't actually fed these guys specialist food yet because i'm waiting for some to come in but it's now arrived so let's get it in this little tray thing this guy's gonna have to come out because otherwise you're gonna get it full on your head so when i was at aquarium gardens i've got this denali shrimp king stuff i don't know if it's any good or not but it had five in one so it's got all like different kinds of things like minerals proteins complete leaf mix and snow pops whatever that is anyway i'm gonna put one of each in that little tray feeding tray and then just see what they like whoa whoa whoa what is this wizardry look at this snow pops thing it's like growing i guess that's why it pops it's getting massive never seen that before looks pretty cool i hope they like it well look the shrimp are straight on it so that's a really good sign that's the first food i put in where the shrimp would jump straight on so nice one denile i mean no my shrimp though i'll come back tomorrow morning and none of this food will be in the bowl it'll be scattered about the place or maybe it'll all be eaten i mean that'd be even even better you know i'm looking to breed these shrimp and it's important to get quality food into them because you know they are what they ate same with all of us really isn't it so hopefully this stuff's really good now currently they are the only shrimp that i've got apart from a few amano's that i've got in this one so i have got some new blue bolt or blue dream shrimp what's the difference blue bolt bluetooth anyway i've got some cool blue neocaridina shrimp that i want to put in this one and here they are over by the sink in this pot look um i took them out of the bag because i picked them up earlier on this morning didn't want to keep them in the bag so i've just put them in here with some nice clean water that looks kind of hazy but it's not so i can put this straight in i've got 10 10 blues there and a couple of babies as well which is nice i just need to drip acclimate them for a little bit to make sure that like the the water parameters are the same temperature wires are already good but you know that water is probably very different to what the stuff that i got in a different county it's the county next to me from where i got them so from where i got them i don't know what that means anyway drip hack for me click subscribe [Music] so they're all drip acclimating fine i've just looked over oh my goodness the shrimp are loving this is it attracted every single one no there's one little guy i can see back there still come on son get involved get into the party these guys look they're loving it oh that's awesome really really good nice big feed and surely this is gonna bring on some like breeding action get some eggs and everything but definitely got male and female mixes in here like that one not that one in the front the one just next to it behind that's definitely a male so you see how the way it's got that sort of curved back to it that curves downwards the one the front that's got that little bubbly roundedness to the bottom so the that's how you distinguish between the males and females but these these these shrimp are gorgeous absolutely love them i mean they are my favorite as well like you can get tons of oh no the one that i have seen that looks amazing is the blue ones that have got orange eyes i mean that's crazy i gotta get hold of those some of those at some point so my original plan was to scape all of the shrimp tanks you can see behind me but i'm having so much fun just collecting them and seeing you know the behavior learning more about them that i'm just going to keep them as they are as like a few plants and a little bit of substrate which is the tropical aqua soil i'm just going to keep it as it is for now and just just watch them and learn and try and get them breeding and get those numbers up those numbers up those are rookie numbers in this racket i just really enjoy that part i've got so many tanks i've aquascaped here and i'm actually going to be escaping all six of these ones for nanofish so and for the killifish as well getting way more involved in the killifish you guys love those you love that video i love them i've actually ordered more i've just gotta wait for them to arrive as well no prizes for guessing the ones i ordered i told you in the last killifish video it was my favorite ones i found them i've got them they're on their way not cheap either actually the fish were cheap but the shipping was like way more expensive than the fish but that's all right that's that's what you've got to do in there if you want to get specialist fish you've got to order them online it's just there's no way around it i've tried finding them in the stores pretty local to me within like an hour's distance but there doesn't seem to be any so ordering online only option some of you guys in the comments have said good things about ordering online so that's great as well well the shrimp have now been acclimated for 40 minutes in fact i'd actually forgotten about i was away editing but look it's all fine it's all good so we can now put them into their new home [Music] haha yes well they're in but it's difficult to see on this substrate i'm going to be taking this clam out by the way guys it's absolutely fine it keeps opening and closing and it's actually travelled from this spot here all the way across there so they're still alive and well i didn't actually know they moved so that's pretty cool but i'm going to be moving it into a bigger tank it's not standing here in fact i'll do that in just a second but i think i'm going to give these guys some food because these guys over here the crystals are still going absolutely nuts all of that food so i'm going to put some in here as well now there's not as many shrimp so i'll just put half the amount and also i haven't got a tray which is normal and will not trade you know a dish a feeding dish i'm going to order a few more definitely well i've got six tanks here so i need six dishes don't i [Music] well i was gonna say hopefully we'll come back in a minute and there'll be shrimp on these but there's already one on there straight away but i'd like to see all 10 on there as soon as possible i think i probably fed way too much there but you know any extras that are not eaten in the next sort of like hour or so whilst i'm here at the studio i can just suck out with a um a turkey baster so it doesn't go like foul and it doesn't cause any ammonia spikes in the water because you don't want that at all uneaten food will cause they're sensitive things these shrimp so you don't want ammonia spikes at all and the award for the most obvious thing to say goes to me of course you don't want ammonia in your tank killifish update guys the liar tails are actually doing really really well they're always coming out well they're all doing well don't get me wrong but the live tiles are brilliant because they're always out they're always at the front just fed them look you can see all that food on the surface just a little pinch look there's only two fish in there remember so you don't need like loads and loads but yeah these are brilliant they're so fun and uh this one here this male particularly he he just comes to greet me whenever i come in the room which is quite nice i wish the other ones would do the same so moving down in this one we've got the volcanoes now the female you can see there look she is always coming out which is brilliant we get to see her quite a lot the male sits right at the back there i don't know if i'm picking him up at all but he sits right in the back no i'm not picking him up where is he well now i don't even know where the mail's gone but he was here two seconds ago because i checked where they were before putting some more food in for them but the fact that she's come out because she was hiding as well so she knows that there's food in the water so that's brilliant side we need them to get eaten don't we obviously well hello though you're very friendly aren't you oh that's good to know look she she eats from the bottom which is good i was a little bit worried that if they didn't get the food it was falling that they wouldn't eat but that's not the case look i've seen her eating off the bottom and i've seen others as well the other ones at the top see there you go she grabbed that one nice spit spits it straight out very ungrateful it's not free you know you have to pay for this stop spitting it out and over to the splendid well he's just in the same spot as when i first got him well that's fine you know he's cool it does come out cause i've come in the room and he darts back that is his little cave in the back there am i making him out i think i am right next to where that sort of white ceramic bit is on the uh plant there he just sits there this is my home i like my home i'm safe i'm safe here and oh hello mr snail you're you're loving the the home though you're exploring that's good that's what we want to see some exploration of the tanks many of you noticed in the last video as well this plant right here the blitzy shiponika hanging on by one little piece of root well it's starting to root more now i mean i could replant it but it's quite fun watching the roots come to where it's not it's like watching roots grow what am i talking about [Music] now since i started making this video i actually rescaped one of the shrimp tanks the crystal reds you would have seen that probably in the build video on saturday if you haven't go look at my channel page with the list of video yeah just click click something somewhere that's not great salesman channel is it but anyway who cares they've been set up for three days now let's have a look how they're getting on hey look at this swimmer yeah doing really good oh let me turn the light off it might stop that stuff in the background is that better yeah i think that's better okay so a few of you were concerned you were saying about this uh what's it called sponge filter uh the fact that it's so close to the surface means it's gonna be less efficient well i mean the water's crystal clear and it's clearly sucking stuff in because it's already got like a haze on it and you know i think to be fair it's efficient enough for what we need for this size tank it's just you could probably go filterless with this and still do really well if you kept up on your water changes you certainly could with the other tanks because they got loads and loads of stem plants in and stem plants as we know suck out nutrients from the water column but to the shrimp so they've eaten everything that was in their little dish which is good i did take some out because it was massively full the last time i fed them i'm kind of learning as i go along how much to feed them and basically those little sticks you put in you probably just need one tiny bit broken off for the amount of shrimp i've got in here at the moment and they will just munch through that in no time so already you can see that the hydrocarbon japan which is this sort of clovery looking leaf that has already started to straighten up and start to grow upwards now some people can be like oh don't put that in your tank it's very invasive and it just grows everywhere good that's what i want you can just trim it back so easily like you can just pull one bit and it pulls the rest up so it's easy to actually look out for but i'm really looking forward to the blix of japonica in the middle there that will thicken up and get huge just like we're seeing in this tank now this is the ember tetra one and many of you seen this as well see this see the blix of japonic at the back there see how it's just doing the nice wispiness that was a tiny little plant when i put that in um and now it's like that so these are actually already a half decent size they're gonna be massive in no time i'm gonna have to keep up on the maintenance of this tank or it will just turn into a messy jungle that's the thing with the stuff with a tank like this that's like kind of wild looking it can get out of control fast so i'm not one who's been great at keeping up on maintenance in terms of trimming and things so for this one i'm gonna make sure i do betty betty where are you i don't see betty everyone where's betty you know betty the biggest one the absolute beast the monster crystal red shrimp must be at the back i mean to be fair those ones over there on the filter they they're pretty decent size betty where are you actually probably hiding so i'm actually expecting another shipment of shrimp to arrive this week and i'm hoping to come in that shipment because sometimes you don't get what you ask for just a load of the standard cherry shrimp now i want to start breeding them in obviously these aquariums but when i start getting bigger numbers i'm going to move them across and just populate all aquariums because shrimp are amazing at cleaning your tank especially breeding shrimp now amano shrimp are the king of cleaners when it comes to shrimp but they don't breed in fresh water you have to have sort of brackish water and even then it's only been done by a few i'd love to have a go at it someday but at the moment i've got loads of other things going on many of you have actually asked me to do it but i just don't have the time at the moment not with these projects and they've got some big projects coming as well but cherry shrimp on the other hand they breed in fresh water and they breed a lot the numbers tend to be exponential in terms of growth so like you'll start off with with a good amount to start off with is about 20. that starts the colony you're gonna have good females good males and before you know it you're sort of putting babies across to other tanks and they're starting their own car cherry shrimp are brilliant i did have a lot going in a few tanks in my very first shed but when i had to break down all the tanks to move into the newer studio not this one the second studio this is the fourth studio now wow this is happening fast yeah i lost a lot of the shrimp because they don't again they're not like massive parameter changes so if you just like drain a load of the tank water and fill it up again it's very difficult you do tend to get a lot of dark i didn't get the dark straight away but it happened over time and before you know it yeah the numbers dwindle but i want to give it a go again and get back onto it but that is it for this one guys if you haven't already click the like and subscribe button and i will see you on the next one [Music] me", "XhspNqUZaRY": ": This here is a hypno joint.

crayfish in it but we're gonna add some beautiful blue neo carabiners to this common Raya [Music] so it has been three weeks on the shrimp are finally here let's get them on box all right let's go we have to try and do this with one hand and I probably won't show you all this either because it's kind of boring I let's just open the box see nothing in the Cruces of the bug I'm going to cut open this bark queer but this time Jana has used breather bugs let's see take my hand more of them all the way in [Music] take the bark again roll over check the corners by always double-check these again after anyway right so how many do we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 so give me one extra money just sitting here for this and I'll show you that and then we'll jabbar hakeem in honor of yours one more and then say just hold it didn't keep some weight on it this is a good practice to do if you have shrimp in the tank as well because it stops shrimp run into the hood back over the top like this decent length of pipe here to create the suction sighting thick into a little air available in this I use little there roads and this is dripping probably two or three drips a second alright and there's the drop I have a decent drop into the bucket just to give it a little splash and ripple to the water moving by and I would imagine with the difference in TDs that this is going to take probably four five six or something like that right for this to equalize itself okay guys so this was a drip and a half is no 10 o'clock at night these shrimp have been dripping for 11 hours this is how much time I give them to acclimate and they've all done very well I do see in here as well that there is some more so some of them have multi which is a good sign we now have marching TDS in the container under the tank so now we can release the shrimp and I think it's this is probably a good spot for you to see just how much bio forms in the glass here and how much light there is right so these guys get in that tank hopefully it was sitting quite nicely because this isn't the GoPro and it's not always the best for a shoe and close-up stuff now the plant by the way is sunset hydro I thought I put some platinum there just to give them something to swim there in them we're getting a lot of the dark side of the shrimp simply because the lace on the other side right so then we'll go ahead and I'm gonna check this one and I'm second like so this is one of the ones I thought was buried come on and you go and as I said to you guys before we'll also do feedings and stuff where this is wherever I'm gonna do this next but a teeny bit different than what I would normally do well I'm not just gonna show you some music we're gonna do things a little bit different this time and the way I'm going to do guys is you would see the shrimp again where did they go they all disappeared already there was 21 shrimp I can't even see one they're all in amongst this let's see maybe you can get another pair of you over here what we will do is I want to show you these shrimp again until I have a breathing colony of them I don't know you're gonna say well mark that you may not be able to breed them well there is my confidence I'm telling you I won't show you these shrimp again until we have a breeding colony right so that will probably take me a week or two because I'm so good at doing this this is this female up here that I wasn't sure if she was bared no I can't actually see in the GoPro lens but she's not all maybe that's just a marking on the side it's pretty cool anyway very nice the confirmed right so I'll keep you guys updated fingers crossed rate the next thing you will see next is baby shrimp [Music] [Music] so let's talk a little bit about this tank briefly while I show you all these lovely beautiful baby blue dream near caridina shrimp let's start off with the basic parameters in this tank I use a buffer called salt and mineral to make my tedious war in this time to 180 parts per million for people that use GTH that means a 6 gh and a 4 cage the water is the same temperature as my room which is between 22 degrees Celsius on 25 degrees Celsius all the time this tank is filtered by a part many from aqua l and it also has the double sponge filter modification i have videos on my channel about that have you wish to see it I like to have a little bit airflow through the war and this tank is on a medium flow with this this low pump in the tank itself I like to have lots of rock cover for neo carabineers because I want as much biofilm as possible you don't get that with lots of plants you want as much biofilm and surface air as possible for biofilm and algae another little goodies to grow in a perfect example of this guys is this corner here look at the mount of a microphone and this tank if you have tons of microphone ax you will have a lot of baby shrimp the other important thing that I haven't mentioned yet where this tank is I like snails and in particular I like lots of snails when you set up the targa in the beginning here for an example is aspic sea snail  sea snails are really good in a shrimp tank because they eat leftover food and they also eat dead shrimp here are some eggs up here in the corner have you want to see what they look like they breed a little bit slow for me have had some parties of eggs but they tend to be slower than assassin snails so don't worry about them eating your shrimp they also help with the cycling of the tank as well in the beginning before you guys would have seen this tank setup I actually add a lot of Malaysian trumpet snails to the tank as well I do temperature water change on this every week or two and that is it I also like to use leaves to promote biofilm growth in my shrimp times as well before in the video I just want to say thank you for watching if you want to subscribe and see tons and tons of shrimp like I'm going to show you now then please hit the subscribe button and bail notifications so you never miss another video because I breed tons and tons of shrimp and I'm a very successful shrimp breeder thank you for watching guys not

a bet that you got a fish let's go buddy oh let's go this is awesome actually thank you dude also get wrecked it uh looks like it might be a busy day on the river today that's sunday march i 14th broke my rod tip it's 10 30 a.m and the river's already got six people right where i just parked so let's go see how the fishing goes this morning you may have noticed i have a really fun uh really nerdy fly fishing hat on that's because it's going up to 14 today and i expect i'll spend some time in the sun and i'm a ginger oh that looks fun drifting down the river this guy who's on this corner

running a bit off color it's even a bit more murky and brown than it was last week uh and a little higher i think i would say it's running a little higher so uh three weeks ago now where i caught that nice 20 inch brown trout was uh right behind this pillar maybe 5 10 meters back just chilling at 14 degrees in the sun in march fishing for trout and whitefish on the bow river 25 minutes from home i mean there's not many places you can do that you guys should let me know in the comments do you know of anyone who's ever picked up a fish on the bow river with an egg pattern i just i haven't seen it if you've seen it link the video or let me know if it's been you we have to be so grateful for what we have here now here's another guidebook hey buddy's got a nice spot over here on the rocks i've never fished that side there's three dudes up near the parking area that have uh like monster trucks like that i loved as a kid and they're just going for a walk and ripping their monster trucks this is amazing i love this all right so first things first we got to check our nets because right we got a bet we got a bet going whose net is bigger i said they're the exact same you don't need to fly

now always all right so this is our winnings oh i like the little flash on the beat dude i don't know why i remember it being all right that's fine so drowsy and i had a bet that we had a bat based on a video he sent me of this massive fishy cot that his net was bigger than mine this fish was clearly bigger i was willing to concede that but i saw his net and it's the same as mine and i was like i guarantee i'll bet you a fly that our nets are the same size and uh he just lost a bet so i get this time what is this like a size 22 oh yeah this is awesome actually thank you dude also get wrecked i

apparently is pretty strong so we'll give it a give it a go i saw it i saw the bend there's a lot of north facing wind today it's making casting east a little bit difficult keep slapping myself in the back with my flies you got a fish let's go buddy [Music] oh let's go there we go well it's not leading this is nice yeah oh it's already out it's all good man thank you though yeah get her release on

like the 9th or 10th boat we've seen yeah fly fishing bow river dot com definitely a guide boat i didn't know there were this many drift boats in all of calgary this is crazy this must be insane during the summer just absolutely insane i think buddy got a fish yeah i saw a body hook up onto a fish here and then it fell off so we're going back when you see the drift boat come back for the third time i guess you know that there's some fish here all right guys uh i haven't caught a fish today i've been had a couple bites now it's just about uh drowsy showed up though and uh he got a nice white fish yeah i'm gonna head back out fishing tomorrow i think i'm gonna go down to cranston in the morning and just check out that new area see if i can't get on some fish down there and mix it up a little bit and if it doesn't work then i'll come back here anyway thanks for watching the video take care guys good luck", "i3NuGuzqrpA": "Hello and welcome! In this video I introduce my blue dream shrimp, who I keep in my second nano-aquarium. The Blue Dream shrimp is also called blue velvet shrimp and it is a breeding variant of the Neocaridina davidi shrimp. It is colored from blue to deep blue with some darkblue to black spots. I found the shrimp on a classified ad portal and bought them from a private breeder. I do not own any osmosis plant and therefore I wanted to have animals that are already used to tap water, wich is pretty hard in the area I live in. This way you do not necessarily get the nicest Shrimp, because the seller probably keeps the best for himself and the Neocaridina\nShrimp are also known to fade over the generations. So I also have some animals here,\nthat are not colored all over, but for that they were relatively cheap. All animals survived the transport and\nat home I put them into a glass that I left stand for an hour. So the shrimp could calm down and got used to the room temperature because my aquariums are not heated. From above you can see very well that the shrimp are quite different in size and also not all colored. One day before buying them, I had made a big water change and after the temperature in the glass adjusted I\nstarted to dribble 10 milliliters of aquarium water into the glass every 5 minutes. After a total of two and a half hours the glass was almost full and the shrimp were still good. So I decided to transfer them into the aquarium. For that, I pour all the water out of the glass, which is a bit gentler than to catch the animals with a net, and then let carefully run water from the surface of the aquarium into the glass. The first shrimp hiss into the tank immediately, others need a bit of a bit of help to get out. Neocaridina shrimp are considered to be robust and easy to keep because they are not too sensitive to the water parameters. Depending on the source they can be kept at a GH and a KH of 3 to 30 and a PH of 6.5 to 8 and it is said that they survive\ntemperatures between 5 and 30 degrees celsius. They are probably feeling best \nbetween 18 and 26 degrees celsius. In most the households this is the room temperature, which is why you usually do not have to heat the aquarium. But it may be that it has to be cooled in the summer. The females grow up to 3 cm while the males stay usually a little smaller with 2.5 cm. They get 18 to 24 months old and can already be kept in aquariums of 12 liters. Recommended are tanks from 20 liters\nand more, in which they also breed faster and in larger numbers. Especially for beginners shrimp keeping in bigger tanks is easier, because the water parameters \u200b\u200bmostly remain more stable. Also, you can put in  more shrimp,\nwhich is also better for their wellbeing. 10 animals should be kept as minimum, but more are better, so that it is also guaranteed that the gender ratio is right so that they breed soon! Breeding Neocaridinas in fresh water is\neasily possible. The females form the eggs under the carapace on their back. When the eggs are mature, the females release attractants into the water and as soon as the males weather them they whiz through the aquarium like mad to find the mating female. After mating, the female moves the\nEggs under the belly and hatch then fully developed but very small shrimps after about 4 to 6 weeks. That is why it is very important that the filter is protected with a tight mesh or fine-pored sponge, so that the babies do not get in there. In the beginning the small shrimp shed their skin very often. So it is important to provide many hiding places for them in the aquarium if possible. The intense color expression is not guaranteed for the offspring and so a selection may be necessary to receive it. If you keep different color variants of Neocaridina shrimp together in the same tank they will mix and after some generations the colorless natural form comes back. So if you attach importance to the color of your shrimp keep them separate. To keep the shrimp with fish that do not harm the animals is easily possible. But just in this case there should be enough hiding space fore the shrimp. In addition, the neocaridinas do not have\nspecial demands on the set up of the aquarium. You can set it up just how you like it. A bit of Moss and root wood is usually already enough for them. If you put in some leaves of beech or oak,\nfrom the sea almond tree or from the mulberry tree and a few alder cones, the shrimp are often\nalready happy. Once a biofilm has formed on the leaves\nthe shrimp will start to graze it, and when the foliage decomposes, it is eroded down to the skeleton by them. If you do not have too many animals in the tank and if you do not want to breed, you do not have to feed them, because the shrimp are\ngrowth eater and usually provide themselves. But if the animals are often very restless\nand do not sit in one spot for longer, then it may be that they do not find enough food in the aquarium and might be hungry. In this case, from time to time special food can be fed to the shrimp. But not too much, because shrimp do not eat very fast and uneaten food can affect the water quality. The shrimp also often split the food\nin very small pieces, which then sinks into the soil and starts to rot. I therefore use a food bowl made of glass, in where I let sink the food. You can buy special tubes for this purpose, but I use the intake pipe from my Dennerle\u00ae Nano siphon, for that. I've also made a video about the siphon before. So I can put the food exactly there,\nwhere I want it. Here I feed the shrimp natural shrimp food from Sera\u00ae, which I linked in the video description. My shrimps are happy if I put 3 to 4 grains of the food in the aquarium every couple of days. When they all rush to the first grain\nI know that the shrimp are hungry and add a few more. If the first grain is unnoticed, I do not put in any more and the first one will be then mostly eaten by the slugs. These shrimp here were kept in a species pool by the breeder, which is why they were not very shy from the beginning and \nlike to show up. It's a lot of fun to watch how they crawl through the aquarium and stop here and there to eat something. I hope I could arouse your interest for these beautiful shrimp with this video. But before you buy them, please inform\nyourself about the housing conditions, because this video is only for general information and I make no claim that everything is correct and complete.

simple controls alright let me get out of light there with the camera we got just simply bass middle treble volume and gain those set pretty much straight up and then we'll just control the gain and volume to just get the ever so slight as touch a break up and that way when you back off your volume knob you got it clean that's the way we like to do two amps around here and the shure sm7b which just happens to be one of my favorite guitar recording amp microphones guitar amp recording microphones so that gives you an idea where the tones coming from simple 5 watt all tube okay no frills i've got the big marshall down here but um you know that kind of adds its own character and this is pretty neutral but good sounding amp alright thanks for tuning in JDM pedals review here we've got the illustrious stefan hendrix helping us out today so that i can twist knobs while he plays the guitar he's gonna play a little bit of rhythm stuff in a and then we're gonna flip on the pedal and go from there so give us a little rhythm there stefan with the dream unlike a usual - screamer this one's based more on st-9 rather rare version that has adjustable control all the way down your - typical tube screamer kind of sounds so kind of without Dennis behind the st-9 the tone controls the passive tone control so generally it only cuts your not boosting sigh here is the dream dream switch the dream and scream result and dream mode you're gonna get a lot more transparency I'm still getting that fullness alright thanks Stefan so and a quick and easy review here we've gone through the features we've got our gain which is gonna give you about double as much gain when you're in the screen mode as opposed to the dream mode dream is great for rhythm stuff scream of course for leads we've got adjustable base mids and treble it is a passive tone control which kind of gives you the purest smoothest kind of sound so generally speaking you'll start with it all the way up and then adjust back if your pickups are a little bright alright and then a volume with the volume of course you can even just drive your amplifier let's try that stuff on play a little bit more lead stuff for me we've got a lot of volume on tap fire I'm offering in the distance all right thanks for tuning in thanks for checking out this pedal is available at Joe doc music.com on the JDM pedals and there's

something sprinkled oh my glasses okay so today we are reviewing blue dream um from nature's medicine um again it's in one of those collectors jars didn't open it or nothing until just now and we're gonna open this bad boy up oh i got the sticker i like getting the sticker on some of these because as i have it in my journals i can put them around however because they do track a lot of what this does so this gives me the actual tag as to what this blue dream is where i got it from batch numbers all of that stuff so i keep a lot of that stuff in my my review journals just so that way i have more reference i've reviewed over 500 different strains of cannabis to date um i think i've done the entire arizona state of arizona as far as dispensaries go i do want to start getting in touch with some caregivers and working with some of them to get some education out and get you know everything going that way especially because prop 207 passed and we have um recreational marijuana so let's see what we got here so this is blue dream by nature's medicine it's a little lemony sweet a little dank so not bad let's take a look at what we got here here are the buds nice little green gold i need a couple different greens and then gold but that's very interesting so yes all right so one of the reasons why i do that especially with my camera this way is because if there's anything like molds or sand or heaven forbid glass put any of those things once you have it in the light and you're turning it especially if you zoom in on your camera um your camera mode it does detect a lot of that stuff so that's a grander upping go to good cute [Music] so my grinder was getting a bit sticky and hard to turn earlier to get it cleaned out so i cleaned it up and re it um i grease ours with coconut oil it does help make it a little bit easier to get through to not having your buds and that that sticky ooey gooey yumminess clogging up so let's see what we got yeah i guess there's some pinks in here but mostly greens and golds with a little a little light dusting of pink or it's just a reflection off my grinder it's a little dry well it's a little lot dry as always guys foot cancer [ __ ] anxiety [ __ ] depression [ __ ] face diapers it was a good and out the bad i don't know if any of y'all have heard or noticed anything out there um but i hear they're starting to close down the marijuana borders and starting to charge a double tax and i can't remember what they called the tax it's under the same type of a premise that here in arizona we have the blm tax it's the that same general idea so uh yeah if you notice it your bills start getting a little bit more or even at the medical dispensary that your your you know whatever you normally buy is now more expensive that would be why definitely need a water bomb that burns the throat so blue dream it is a cross between blueberry and hate and haze haze strains she is a 60 40 sativa hybrid um she has a 17 to 24 thc level and about a two percent cbd level and a one percent cbn level which is always nice so this is one of the most famous strains the blue dream high as having an immediate onset of an uplifting cerebral head high that leaves you completely motivated and focused with waves of creative energy the effects of this are creative energizing euphoria and happy medicinally to treat add adhd anxiety autism bipolar disorder chronic pain depression headaches inflammation nausea ptsd and stress so good stuff as always overall nature's medicine if i can't breathe it sounds like god's father now uh great job awesome job tastes amazing looks good effects we will see but i am more of a dab girl so um i feel more i don't feel too many effects off of flower anymore um but thank you guys for joining me today i will be back tomorrow i believe with actually concentrate and i have not decided if it's going to be nature's best um or nature's medicine concentrate or one of the others so as always have a great day stay safe out there mad love and i'll see you back tomorrow bye guys", "ckq8rG5yUfg": "Hey Florida medical marijuana patients what's happening this is Florida medical marijuana reviews again with another Liberty Health Sciences flower this strain being Blue Dream it is a sativa dominant strain it's still a hybrid like every other strain as though and all aspects of the word I cannot stand that we even pick a dominance at all seeing as they are all absolute hybrids but that's just one tokers take if you will this strain comes from crossing an indica blueberry with a sativa haze and this strain definitely has the look of a haze dominant strain these have tightly packed nugs bright orange ii fiery tips of hairs but it also has this wild trim all over it I mean it's like devilish horns covering covering all these flowers here and I think that's why they had such a hard time parting with all the trim on this plant and that's why they left it it is just so frosty it's almost a crying shame to have probably trimmed what they even did trim off of these nugs but again these aren't fully developed turbines these are almost like sticks like frosty hairy sticks all over it you won't see many of the beaded heads of trichomes or terpenes across this flower at all but it is still a beautiful flower they've got going on here at $28 an eighth I mean how can you truly complain about that at all that is a flower that I will be going back for for sure medically speaking I felt like it was a great feeling throughout the entire experience but it wasn't very long-lasting my head felt great I felt like it almost even tackled a little bit of my pains I was a little sore from the day before before I tried this strain and I think that it very much tackled that issue as well it's a very light smoke it's not harsh they cured it very well there's nothing about that that shouldn't be smoked it's fantastic right here's where you kind of see we focus on what looks like a little bit of purple on the trim and that was like our only part of the plan that we really saw it on not many of the other nugs in the whole quarter that we scooped do we see much purple there was a little bit Sears in there it was a great flower I'll truly be coming back to Liberty Health Sciences for this strain again I thoroughly enjoyed it I think it's definitely worth the money at $28 an eighth again you cannot go wrong my friends my only hang-up of course being that the closest Liberty Health Sciences is all the way in Tallahassee and they no longer deliver their flour anymore they'll deliver everything else for free statewide but they stopped delivering flour I don't know if it's because of demand they can't meet they don't know how to organize it or whatever I hope to update otherwise

gonna just pick up where i left off last time we're really kind of it just the whole rhythm of the music change during the solo are we gonna pick up there so that is this part we're still in standard tuning alright so what's going on there we are just just try out here just across the B G and the D string of the third fret he's really focusing on the two middle strings though and then he keeps rotating it between just kind of holding this thumb here on the low E string and grabbing that third fret there we have that move up to press there then back and you go three to five again but this time you slice and we slide there hit it again and then we have this that's you playing the fifth fret across the D G and the B camera on the sixth fret 3 on the B take it again and back to the C major plan out there alright next phrase all right so that's the fifth fret there on the G seventh fret Bend and back to the fifth fret slide in now to 14 on the D / 12 on the g and 13 on the B and then now replace that third 13th right there with your first finger now then a couple of Bin's there at the 15th fret then back to the 13th alright next phrase alright so that's a bin there at the 15th fret on the beat then 12 13 14 15 you just work your way all the way up photos then half step Bend at the 17th fret 3 of them and then Bend the release of the 15th on the B over 270 on the G then 1517 of you all right next phrase all right so that's a half step in release at the 14th fret a few times on the g3 then and then we had that's 12 on the G 13 on the D and then he hits a pinch harmonic through the 13th fret on the a-string and bends it up a whole-step all right then then slide into the 10th fret on the D and then you have a double stop here at the eighth fret on the G and the B together did that a couple times and then back to the 10th fret on the D alright and now we have this fun little pentatonic bass lick sounds like this all right so we had so that's a bin there at the 11th throughout whole step Bend on the beam and then roll from the 8th on the high e to the 8th on the beat then pull off 12 to 8 on the high E strings for this and then 11 to 8 on the beat you can pick those two notes and then we have 10 9 on the G and that has that been in release when you get to that 9 on the G square this altogether and then we're gonna play a 10-8 on the deed just slight pause there so we all together all right from now that's just playing 10 on the a to the 8 on the beat a D string sorry and you just little slight bins when you hit the eighth fret there on the deep and it would attempt threat there and then we go into that long ligado look which sounds like this all right so just as in the first video when you get to that kind of signature Satriani legato stuff first just get the notes the the patterns of the notes down first and then it's just a pretty much the same the same legato you know kind of style pattern that goes through it so you just got to follow the scale so let's learn the three know groupings that these patterns are built from so we have five fifteen seventeen eighteen in the high e then 13 15 17 then 12 13 15 and then 10 12 13 so we have this so far I'm just kind of pretty much taking the same leg and just do it on all three set all little three no groups now that's not going to be consistent he's not consistent with the pattern as he goes down either like I said it's more of just a feel it was kind of doing a kind of a cooler guy look all the way through the scale he probably doesn't do it the same way twice himself but he does use the same three no groups so we have so from there we go over to the B string now and we're playing the three notes will be doing the legato looked with it's going to be the 10 11 and 13 then over to the g-string the 9 10 and 12 staying on the g-string seven nine ten and then we're down to the the last note group which is ten to a seven eight and ten on the D string now what he likes to do is first on top it ends with that top notes we have this and what we did there is we do a band at the 6th fret kind of a big bin kind of a slope in the six final OE up a whole step and then just release it all right so that's it for the soloing then he gets back to the same kind of phrase we did or did earlier in the first video it's just slightly altered but if you know the notes and you know the song well enough is pretty easy to go I've seen live videos have been doing this and he actually doesn't play that melody phrase at the exact same way it doesn't really twice so it's kind of like you do your own things of those knows it's the same exact notes as before the same and it's a little harmonized there but that's still the main line there that's played that you did in the first video and so we still had this now he actually does it twice here and there's a one of where he hits a pitch harmonic on the string and then just died bars just kind of that kind of thing he reaches over and just you know you can hit on the B or the g string there I like that there's nothing very consistent about that either and then we have back to the same melody and then there's a rhythm guitar part that ends it after you get there to kind of that close up the song of the keys repeating resounded this so this requires a bit of a stretch you're gonna be playing a C major chord here with these fingers here so you can just grab the bar up here at the fifth fret of the D G and the B there from the a and you're gonna reach up with your pinky and you're gonna grab the seventh fret on the B and the G together they'd the four middle strings root note first and then for those strings a few times and then resolve it to the seat so from there he has this you're just working on these to the fifth string and the fourth string together three five there and then push it to the fourth fret there on the D string and then back to the fifth fret so we have this all together and it really uh accenting that whole the Lydian notes there alright so I hope you guys enjoyed it this has got some really cool guitar stuff in it it's a rave melodic and fun song to play so it will keep you busy for a while I'll be enjoyed it I'll see you again soon you", "ieHb9El1ZeY": "hey friends abs here with Gen sense and today I've got one of those haul unboxing first impression videos and this one is centered around niche and indie fragrances so I've got four to go over with you here today - nice - indie I've got pin Halligan's portraits collection roaring Radcliffe or Mon Jane or Mon man and two fragrances from Zarina which is a house that I low-key really love so one of those fragrances is this one blue dream and the other mask so without further ado let's crack into these check them out see how good they are so I'm gonna do this I render fragrances first just because I like as I rented that much if you're not aware of zai Rena they're a really really quirky indie house their fragrances come packaged in these sick sick boxes they look like VHS boxes so for those of you who were around back in the day back in the day you'll remember VCRs and VHS tapes that is exactly what these look like I'll bring these in for a closer look here in a second but you've got the name of the fragrance right here it looks like basically a cheesy kind of poster for an action film at least for this one mask which is short from masculine this is supposed to be their take on people-pleasing versatile masculine kind of scent maybe a blue fragrance if you will and then on the spine of the box here this irena logo looks like a blockbuster logo you remember a blockbuster some of you do some of you don't and then on the back a write up on the fragrance open it up your fragrance sits inside like so because these look so cool let me show it to you a little closer up so here you can see the front of the box here this guy looks like the absolute ultimate douche bro I mean he has it all going on he's got the six tribal showing off the abs douchey face and then he's showing a little bit of uh what do you want to call that junk root we'll say junk root because I don't want to get demonetised for saying something else and here is the spine of the box again mask and it's an action fragrance and here is the back of the box here a lot of information there I mean if you really wanted to I guess you could pause this video and read that but we'll just leave it at that I guess I'll read just a little bit from right here so you know exactly what they're going for with this fragrance so they basically say that as irenna as a house that doesn't believe in genders with fragrances they think basically wear whatever you want which I believe that too for the most part and this fragrance they say is the first fragrance that they've made that maybe is intentionally trying to lean one direction more than another instead of being unisex this is unisex leaning masculine basically they're saying that this fragrance is a timeless woodsy signature scent that will instantly tell people I'm a dude with just one whiff then in the words of 80s rock band survivor the search is over so they've taken some other favor of masculine notes and created a sexy crisp clean versatile scent that can easily be worn both day and night for any occasion top notes include mandarin red berries and fresh peppery basil with the heart of our bassist woody florals over a base of rich musk and cedar we can't promise mask will turn you into an action star but it'll definitely increase your odds of getting some then this is the standard as I ran a bottle actually I've got a few of them I'll bust out here to show you and you just have a sticker right over the front there that says mask so there is a good look at the bottle and the fragrance inside as you can see there is a nice blue coloration so I grabbed some of the others I ran a fragrances that I own I've got sneakerhead here I've got dark ride Sinha maniac and basic b-word well I get to monetize if I say that I don't know you can see it right there feel like such an idiot to basic B word and then there's siren s 66 which comes in this style of bottle and I've got to say between these - bottle Styles I much prefer this one I'm not going to talk about those that'll take too much time let me just go ahead and spray this one on see you all smells all right moment of truth it's a little bit alcohol II off the top so there's a blast of alcohol kind of once it first hits your skin here so I'm gonna let that settle for a second so I don't get overwhelmed by that at this point here right in the very initial opening it's giving off kind of a shower gel kind of vibe it does come across like a blue fragrance on the more basic side of things to me it doesn't smell bad but it's not really impressing me at this point a lot of zionists other fragrances are like themed fragrances almost so Cinna maniac is supposed to smell like going into a movie theater it smells like popcorn it smells like licorice pretzel soda stuff like that when you smell it you really get the popcorn like bowel so that one you know a lot of people are gonna say is not wearable but it's neat to smell and then dark riot is supposed to smell like what it says it is a dark ride so a theme park water ride essentially it smells like chlorinated water with like fog that you'll find and like Pirates of the Caribbean at Disney World something like that or a log flume ride so they have a lot of fragrances like that sneaker head is supposed to smell like a new pair of sneakers so a lot of times they're not necessarily things that you would think oh that's wearable but you smell and you go that is really neat though it's almost like a conversation piece or something like that mask here though supposed to be more of just a wearable versatile blue fragrance and it's not super impressive to me I love Cyrene oh and as Irina is basically a one-man show so when you order these if you ever order them it could take a while to get to you these took like four and a half weeks from when I ordered it and when I actually got them it's most pleasant but it's just a basic blue fragrance and at the price that this cost there are a lot of better things out there I'm gonna let it continue drying down though maybe it gets better next up let's take this out blue dream so this is from their reefer madness action will test three fragrances each one of them based off of a different strain of marijuana now I gotta let you guys know I am not familiar with how marijuana is supposed to smell so I'm gonna come off like the lamest person on the face of the planet a general idea but I never got into that not when I was younger not now and not ever I don't have anything against it I mean if you want to do that you know knock yourself out I don't care but this seemed really cool so that's why I got it though here you can see it blue dream then on the back it's got some stills from reefer madness which is pretty cool and then a quick ride up on the fragrance open it up and there it is so here's a better look at the front of the box here and the spine of the box and the back of the box I said it before I'll say it again I love the presentations so awesome and let me go ahead and give this one a spray oh okay that's strong that is way stronger than masks I can smell that immediately wow that's interesting and kind of cool and it's got blueberry it's got a cannabis note and then I think soil as well and it says on the back here to achieve a true-to-life interpretation of blue dream the formula combines both synthetic fragrance oils with natural terpenes found in cannabis did I say that correctly including alpha and beta app I mean Linda Lou and Carol Faline I said that incorrectly I apologize try not to flame me too hard so you do pick up the blueberry but it's kind of an earthy green blueberry it does have a little bit of that sweetness but not an overload and again I'm probably not the best on earth to give you a is this hyper realistic smelling to cannabis or not rating I apologize for that but it does come across a bit like cannabis at least from what I can remember smelling from other people am i coming across like the lamest person on the internet right now I probably am there is a little bit of that soil feeling like I saddle like has a soil vibe sometimes with fragrances that have a soil note or an earthy note it kind of hits you like on the back of your palate almost if that makes any sense like you'll breathe it in and it will be the last thing that lingers in your nose after you smell the fragrance that that earthy tinge and that's what happens here when you first breathe it in you get that little bit of cannabis note and the blueberry that's slightly green blueberry and and then after that's gone you pick up that earthiness not to the same extent but sometimes like if you're outside and you breathe in like dust or or dirt a little bit it doesn't choke you necessarily but then if you start to speak right after you've breathed that in you'll kind of do like this kind of thing it's like that that's what it feels like and you breathe this Sam when you get a good whiff of it that slight earthiness kind of lingers that way this is more interesting I do think it's pretty cool and I'll have to ask my wife she's probably a little more familiar from her younger years of how this should smell and then I'll let you know if it smells a little similar to cannabis or not and I'm smelling mask here again it's pleasant it does smell nice it's got a little bit of sweetness in there ultimately though it does come across like a shower gel kind of scent next up let's open up this one or mon man by or Mont Jane so this one I have smelled before but it's been a while I bought a D Kant years back and I put this on my list of fragrances that I wanted to pick up and just never did until now presentation here is quite nice it has this slipcover then the box is inside of there you've got the ingredient information on the back of the box and then the Box opens up like so there's a little card there the bottle sits right in there and here is the bottle it is quite nice looking got a nice heavy metal cap and I'll go ahead and just spray this one on that way we don't have this video run too long yeah that's really nice it's a nice woodsy fresh dry spicy kind of scent so there's juniper pink pepper it almost comes off a little bit like Cypress initially though Cypress isn't and no I think hemlock is a note yeah pink pepper cedar basically like I said fresh spicy a little bit dry woody very classy masculine gentlemanly kind of fragrance with a good amount of versatility yeah this is the type of fragrance you wear day/night casual formal doesn't really matter you can pull this off in almost any situation quality quite good everything from the presentation to the way the fragrance is coming across here is thumbs up for me like I said I had smelled this years past I bought a decant of it used that decant up and had put this on a list of fragrances that I wanted to buy so super psyched to get this one in my collection yeah that smells freaking great it's got like a green woody feel to it that's one especially in the spring and fall I'll get use out of in the winter time I might wear it here and here and again you know now and again but especially this upcoming spring I'll be busting that out now let's open up this last one pin Halligan's roaring Ratcliffe this is the first one from the portraits collection that I own pin Halligan's is a house that I really like in general for their barbershop kind of fragrances those are the ones that I prefer the most and they're actually pretty affordable as far as their their standard line of fragrances go from discounters this one is like I said from their portraits collection and these have very cool caps on them which you can see right here they are considerably more expensive though than their other fragrances so here's a good look at the front of the box and then the back of the box there for you I'll read this for you I'll try to put everything I have into it being the son of Lord George certainly explains Radcliffe sweetness for the flesh but being illegitimate he's unburdened by expectations and indulges himself with fast cars and faster girls oh he lives for parties and provocation sexy and rebellious every well-bred girl succumbs to his leathery and tobacco fragrance so this one has honey tobacco beeswax other sweet type notes there's a good look of that bottle and it's got this cool metal cap here this one being a lion each one of these fragrances in the portraits collection has a different animal cap and let's give this one a spray okay so this one I think got compared or gets compared to tobacco veiny by Tom Ford I don't really get that off the top I've got to say I mean maybe a little similarity because it's a sweet tobacco type scent but not the same there's a tarragon note in the opening and it's not overriding the notes in the top but what it is doing is giving this kind of nuance like this like this green nuance sort of and it's taking things in a different direction from tobacco vanadium which is something that when you spray it on you get that rich deep sweetness there's also a boozy note and the opening rum I believe it is so you've got honey beeswax rum tobacco kind of thing going on there's also rose in here cinnamon and tonka and that tarragon note pretty quickly does kind of fade away so it's most prominent there initially just in the first few minutes and then that starts to fade away it's kind of on the edge the periphery initially and then it starts to to dissipate and more of that sweetness comes in let's say I'm gonna go ask Chelsea about this fragrance so I went upstairs talked to my wife and got her opinions on all four of these fragrances her favorite one or Mon man which probably my favorite one also will say though roaring Radcliffe the longer it rides down the nicer this smells it's a really pleasant honey tobacco sort of fragrance and it is quite nice the two side Rinna fragrances mask actually smells better as it dries down in the initial opening when you first spray it on it's got that alcohol blast going on then it smells like a generic shower gel the longer it goes it starts to sweeten up and becomes more pleasant for the guys out there who are hard or into fragrance as art even though this is in a way fragrances art it's kind of taking shots at blue fragrances while at the same time being blue fragrance they still might dislike it because it is a blue fragrance that is though absolutely a wearable versatile fragrance that could pull you complements so even though they're taking shots at blue fragrances and people that like blue fragrances it's a decent blue fragrance and then Blue Dream my wife Chelsea she gave this to smell she said it does not smell like any cannabis that she's ever smelled in her life and that it smells earthy and sweet at the same time which is exactly what I think about it as well she did like it though she did say it smelled really cool because it does have that contrast of being sweet and at the same time earthy I think though for people who are not into indie fragrances not into fragrances as art stuff like that it could be hard to pull off because it's not something that's what you would think of as a fragrance that you would wear out on the town or wear casually or to the office overall not let down by any of these I like all of them my favorite is going to be warm on man but all the other three blue dream masks roaring Radcliff solid in their own ways so really really happy with this one or this haul I should say if you've smelled any of these fragrances below let me know what you think about them in the comments and if you want me to review any of these feature them a little more in-depth let me know that as well as always guys thank you so much for watching thanks so much for all of your support I'll see you guys again tomorrow with another fragrance video see you guys [Music]", "owVXY6usDbk": "like and subscribe I'm gonna tie this girl down today a little bit we'll see what it looks like when I'm done all right now she's tied back down so the way here we go this is the north side of the plant you see in the shadow and it doesn't really grow that good you always kind of have a weak side and it'll be the north side so as you grow in your area year after year you'll know what side the weak side is you'll know it's way to face your plant and you'll it'll kind of fill in but it'll never be as good as the south side right the south side of the plant that is obviously pushing the hardest without much help so the way I do this and the way I did it this year is a little different than I've done in previous years but I used the tomato cage and the inside when I planted the plant I would really you know what I'm gonna cut a hole so I can grab that stem and feel big okay so it's getting pretty big definitely wants to be a tree get it cut access holes in the bottom of these and I actually got to cut this one bigger but I just wanted to cut it real quick so we can get in cuz I'm gonna want to start defoliating inside here but yeah so the style of girl that I have been did this summer was obviously did these mounds and I'm trying to grow up grow clover on them but later anyway that being said so I took the tomato cages planted it in the tomato cage so I would have support then I put this wire trellis on the outside and I've been slowly pulling the branches through and now I'm low stress training with green tape looks like electrical tape there's no stickiness to it I get it at a Johnson farm and garden but you can get it on Amazon or probably any pretty fairly decent grow shop but yeah you just tie to the branch and you pull it down so it's flat or not you don't want to pull it down so it's like sagging down you want to pull it more or less level and then all the little side nodes that would be branches become tops and you just keep pulling the branches out and then I'm gonna put a cage on here in the next couple days and these will go into the next cage and once everything is basically through that cage but you can go in start stripping the bottoms out my plan is not really to have much width in this cage you won't see it because the canopy will be covering the other cage but that'll help with a good airflow see this branch here I just kind of pulled down that's the beginning of the training pull it it may or may not stay tonight I'll pull it back through in a couple days and then with this girl home 3 I've been super cropping this so this is a a different style I'll keep super cropping these over so what you do to super trap is I'll skip you if you want to get your arm rend you just kind of pinch one way in the other way and your arm just fit but what you do is you just take a branch see if I can get focused in good enough you pinch it till it squishes bend it one way and it's the other way a couple times and you can lay it down ok and then the side branches will grow up and you do this to all the upper stuff that's sticking up above the other stuff so like and last year I did this to a plan at my buddy's house and I was helping him grow new grower and we kept it like knee-high till the middle of July and it's July and by the end of the season when it flowered it Jack straight vertically so I don't know if that was the strain or if that was the super comp in training style into a cage so we're gonna try that with this one and with this one obviously we're just gonna do the low stress training and trellis work oh yeah that's it everybody thank you for watching like and subscribe I hit me up in the comments or try to comment back to everybody but it seems like I'm not getting notifications of my comments or they're like hiding I have to go to both my just regular YouTube and to YouTube studios to kind of find both all the comments so but I am pretty responsive and I'll answer any questions and or take any vice honestly she's something weird I will correct it but anyway everybody be safe and have fun till next time", "Pqo-vDtNaao": "you hey guys it's Carl brown from guitar lessons 365.com today we're going to begin our look at flying in a Blue Dream by Joe Satriani so we're going to take care of just the first lead guitar section that is in this video we'll take a look at the chords I'm going to do a separate video just kind of let you know what's going on in the tuning in the rhythm guitar parts behind it but I'm going to go ahead and jump into the main solo parts of the song first so this is part one of that so we're going to do the main melody what I just played and the first half of the main guitar solo alright so let's go through it here we're in standard tuning and we're going to start with a little bit the phrasing is a bit odd so you got to really listen to the melody a lot you slide into the first note so you kind of slide down into the fifth row there on the B string gets out a few times and then slide into the seventh fret I didn't slide into seven again and then hammer on seven to eight then slide eight to ten and then back at eight so we kind of have this all right from there we have the second half of that phrase all right so we're basically sliding into the fifth fret from above again and then sliding into the seventh fret basically three times and then one more time going into that hammer on over to seventh front of the beast on the high E string then back to the eighth fret on the B string there now I'm going to move up all right so we're gonna slide into the 7th 13th fret there on the beat then pick it again and then same thing at the 50 and then 16 just pick it no slides over to 15 on the high E over to 18 on the B string back to 18 this time on the high E string and then you do a quick little Oh godoh leg from that top so you're going to pull off 18 to 15 hammer on 18 on the B string pull off 15 ever on 17 on the G a while 15 and the same thing there on the D so you don't really need any picking it so all right from there all right so we're picking 17th fret there a couple times still in the B string and then slide in the 19th fret twice then pick to a hammer over to 19 on the high E then 20 back on the beam while you let that sustain you're really going to want to keep the you know everything kind of moving muted that is so you know the tone setting that I'm using has a lot of sustain on it so you know I'll write down the tone settings for you guys that I'm using with my fractal audio and I'll make sure that it's on the website so you can know just at least see the settings that I'm using alright so we're gonna start here now the top so that's just 21 twice in the high e then up to 22 little by brother bar slide down to the 19 move it up to 20 and let it sustain and the feedback really just kind of takes over with a lot of feedback use in this song and then we have and grab the third fret there on the Asian and as start adding some pinch harmonics to it as you starts building into the solo so now that we've made it to the solo let me play through the first half of it for you and then we'll check it out phrase by phrase you you all right so that's as far as where to get with this one so and this this video at least but it's kind of the halfway point of that solo a lot of crazy legato licks as is the case always with Joe Satriani so let's start here with this first kind of phrase now for anybody who's ever learned to so trying to stop before he has this legato technique which he calls his rolling ball mercury it's the patterns aren't really that set in stone he's really kind of just kind of say be had a little pattern like that go like pull off all the way down come back up and pull off just the mill note so that's what he'll do he'll take that shape and then he'll just move it around the scale form just through the scale so getting this down individually each note for note it's really about the vibe of what he's doing and when he holds it goes down to a note so he's doing a legato lick between those three notes the start with the sole and they slide it down to the second frustrated this alright from there he does goes back to the legato lick between three five and seven and you can see where he's pausing on certain notes so you see that comes over to that you're still doing seven five three let me string play play that step and then that we gotta look again then back to the into the fifth fret on the beach where this I'm slow down song Oh from there he did now he's going between let me show you the notes real quick so we have he does it oh my golly between three five seven on the B then four or five seven on the G then they'll jump up between five seven and nine so this then you're back of four or five seven and then to five four so we gotta had this actually go over I'd be doing four five seven on the G go over to four five seven on the D so we have this and then do this and look down here at two four and five Lindy all right so we're taking that kind of legato concept and just take it through the scale all right so then slide it to the forum back the two on the D alright now we had this longer phrase all right so crazy stuff a balance but like I said he's never going to play the same way twice anyway but he does use the same scale patterns where he's doing his legato licks so you want to just kind of focus on getting your ligado looks going and then you can do the same legato effect he's doing now he's using two three five on the low E two two three five on the a and three five seven for this firstly so we're kind of doing this he starts on the fifth fret pull off the - hammer 3/5 then to three-mile-long ba and info walk 7 by 3 on the witness all right so after doing that three times he started going through the same legato lick like I said it's kind of just a legato effect it's not a set pattern but you need to know where he's putting this more he's planted them so after you hear the three five seven you go to four five seven on the D and four five seven on G and then do the same thing five seven nine the D and five seven nine on the G we have this all the way up to five seven eight ten on the B and seven a ten on the height and then he does the same link between eight ten and twelve on the high E and the B so we have this all together when you get to that top note that the 12th fret on the high E you're gonna you do it tap your pick at the 14th fret on the high E slide up to 15 pull back up to let me slide back down to 14 and it didn't do ligaw look between us with like I said if these legato licks are very confusing to you or this effect then it's probably not a song it should be tackling this kind of concept should be pretty easy to you by just practicing legato and knowing just kind of how it works this is really just kind of telling you where to put your fingers out so as you work your way up and we had that we end it with just kind of this birth tapping and that little got a lick all right and now we have the next phrase which is a little bit more easy to get note for note something Oh you all right so we're going to start with a big step and a half band at the 13th fret of the B string and release then we so we go that's eleven of the high e 15 on the be back to the 11 then pull off 15 to 11 and slide down to 10 really cool leg then you slide into that 12th fret on the G then down to 7/8 on the D string 10 on the a and then you have been to the six right there on the a-string all right seven eight ten on the G stand at the tempura and pull off 10 8 and then now you're doing a bar dive as you play this 15th fret on the G you really don't pick anything Bar dive release and pull off to the 12 then it resolved there to the 16th fret there and when you get to the sixth grade you're going to be pulling off to 12 over to 16 on the D string and then that what the last little leg you're going to pull off 16 to 12 on a D slide down to 7 on the a sorry on the D strings the a note just lied to and and you get a hammer nine ten go back to nine seven vini release and you play this there's just five three two on the a-string we've been there on the two and then want to set your Annie's signature things just hit an open string with a little harmonic on it or a pinch harmonic alright and then he goes into this rage really cool son alright so that starts here at the ninth fret on the a-string goes nine ten nine and then we go thirteen fourteen on the a there's a little quick mutes between each group of notes we'll click down up on a muted so we have three thirteen fourteen ba then 13 14 on the D so we're going to we have this support all right move it up to 16th and 17th on the d-string 1516 on the G back to 1617 for the B string then up to 19 and 20 on that B string whole stead been there at the 20 20 second Fred you play nineteen bending releases the 19th I'm sorry 21st fret on the g-string alright next phrase alright so this was a fun one you're going to pull off you can play 19 on the high E string pull off the 15 and then hammer on the 19th fret on the B and pull off to the 15 on the baby so really the only note your grant you're picking is the very top note and this pause hold it slightly before you do the full of gotta lick into the twentieth fret Bend all right and then we have 17 19 20 on the B string back to 17 on the high e been in release half a step been release at the 19 3 on the B string there and then the f-sharp here the ninth fret on the a-string slight Bend releases all right now we have this ascending lick which is a little bit awkward it is not like a uniform pattern to it so it's going to sound like this I don't live past it a little bit so you know where it's at in the solo alright so we're going to kind of really heavily palm mute this especially on the low strings we're going to have down up on the 11th fret on the a and 1311 then we're going to have 10 12 I'm gonna play the 12 twice then 13 twice then play 1012 on the G so so probably at this then 13 twice and a G 15 on the G - 13 on the B each one of those was just once and then 15 twice on the B 16 twice then 18 once 15 once on the high e 16 twice and then 18 so we have this real slow all right from there we had that next phrase all right that was a cool one so we have bended the 20th fret there high E string then pick it well without dent  being bit twice then half

makeup tutorial on the look I'm wearing right now this is the look I was wearing in my best of colour-pop video which I'm about to film right now but you would have already seen it so this is the look I was wearing in that video only I have on a different lip because I'm about to change it for that video but anyway this is the look and I am using my dream Street palette I've gotten so many requests from you guys to use more of the blue shades in the palette I have like a full matte teal smokey eye using this color up on my channel but I wanted to play around with the more shimmery blues and they seize the look I came up with I messed up a little bit on the eyeliner but you know it isn't a kathleenlights video unless I F up my eyeliner but besides that I love how this look turned out it's so bold and colorful but it was so easy to do and I hope it inspires you to use the Blues in the dream Street palette it's fun to play around with color sometimes and I love that this palette can do both for you so I hope you guys are enjoying all of my dream Street tutorials I wanted to make it a point to really upload tutorials using my palette so those of you who bought it can follow along to some of my tutorials so I hope you are enjoying these videos but anyway I just dropped my phone anyway if you want to see how to get this blue look and just keep watching okay so my eyes are already primed and I'm just gonna jump into the dream Street palette I'm gonna take the shade shooting star and I'm just gonna start buffing this color into my crease just working this in a little by little building up the color this look takes a lot of crease work a lot of blending in the beginning so just bear with me here now I'm gonna go back into the pallet and I'm gonna take the dark brown it's called elfish and I'm gonna be doing the same thing kind of but I'm not really taking this past my crease with shooting star was kind of putting that everywhere but with this shade I'm really really focusing this on the outer corners and I'm dragging it into my crease I'm being a little bit more precise with this shade and just slowly building up that color little by little lots of building now I'm going to take water-bearer and I'm gonna do the exact same thing I did with elfish focusing this on the outer corners and dragging it into the crease building up the color a little by little [Music] so I'm gonna create a cut crease effect but I'm not gonna take it all the way like I usually do or like how I've done in the past I'm just gonna do like a halfway cup crease so I took my color pop concealer and I'm just carving out my lid you see here what I'm doing I'm not passing the crease and I'm not really taking it all the way towards the end and then I'm just gonna fill in my little fill my linen with concealer and then everywhere I applied the concealer I'm gonna go in with the shade kaleidoscope so on a flat brush I'm just going to apply this wherever the concealer is [Music] so to blend the outer corner with the Kaleidoscope shade I went in with the shade mermaid boy and I'm kind of using this to sandwich the outer corner in with kaleidoscope does that make sense well you see it goes from like a gradient it goes from kaleidoscope to a mermaid boy - then water-bearer and I think it looks so pretty so I went back into water-bearer just to intensify the blue because a lot of it did get blended away while we were blending all that eye shadow so I'm just adding some more blue to the outer corners and then to clean up the crease and just you know to blend everything make sure it's nice and seamless I went back into shooting star so that I can get rid of these harsh little lines YZ okay so I'm gonna hop into Moonie and I'm gonna use this to hop into Moonie that was weird I'm gonna use this to highlight my brow bone and then I took a makeup wipe to clean out the to clean up the fallout and to create kind of like a cat eye effect to the eyeshadow so I just made the edges really sharp so I'm gonna move on to the rest of my face before I finish up the eyes you know the drill I went in with my dr. Brandt Luminizer primer and then I went in with two foundations the first one is the hourglass vanish Foundation stick I just pop this on everywhere and then I mixed in a little bit of my Giorgio Armani luminous silk foundation I still don't like the luminous silk on its own but I love it mixed in with other foundations so this is the little cocktail and I'm using today buffing that out with my love is the foundation brush and then for a concealer I went in with my color pop no filter concealer this is the shade light neutral and I'm just buffing that in with a brush I like doing one side first and then going into the other side because this I don't know I've recently I've been doing that with my concealer and I feel like it just it's better because the other side won't dry so quickly and it just looks a little bit more seamless and flawless and not as dry if I do one eye first but anyway I'm just highlighting the rest of my face with the concealer as well and then to set everything down I'm using Patrick's powder I'm so excited I love prep trick I think he's awesome this is a great great powder I think especially if you have oily because it is very mattifying but even with my dry skin I don't think it looked dry under my eyes so I liked it to finish up the eyes I'm going in with the Urban Decay 24/7 glide on pencil in the shade main line I love this eyeliner I use it all the time it's like the perfect teal blue it looks so nice with other blue eyeshadows so I put that on my waterline and I tight line with that as well and then for my lower lash line it's very quick I just didn't I just went in with some shooting star then some elf inch and then I went in with water-bearer as well kind of mimicking what I put in my crease I'm just smudging that on my lower lash line [Music] for my inner corners I went in with a little bit of Moony but since this look is so intense I wanted to go in with something even more intense than that so I took the colour-pop highlighter in flexitarian and I just pop that right on my inner corners to give me that bub I am intense inner corner highlight and then for mascara I'm using the Thrive cosmetics liquid lash extensions mascara I'm only applying a little bit of this because I'm going in with some falsies these are the kamil number 16 ez lash falsies they're just falsies that go on the outer corners of your eyes so I'm here I'm just like brushing out the mascara I'm making sure nothing is clumpy or goopy and then I went in with my em cosmetics Illustrated eyeliner in the felt tip and I created a very thin line just to hide the lash glue and so that everything looks nice and seamless but anyway I applied some lower lash mascara and then I went in with some bronzer this is the Thrive cosmetics Sun tracer bronzer andraia I love to contour with this it's such a smooth creamy bronzer I love it and then to warm up the skin just a little bit more and give myself a little bit more of like a bronzy glow I went in with the colour-pop bronzer in the shade private party this has a little bit of a sheen to it versus the real one that's matte so I just wanted a little bit more of a glow for a blush I'm mixing these two together this is the jus a blush duo in a door and I'm just gonna mix them both together and pop them on my cheeks I love this blush combo it's like the perfect peachy pinky nude so so pretty and then to highlight the tops of my cheeks I'm taking one of my favorite color pop highlighters this is the here kitty-kitty highlighter it's a really pretty like pearly shade and I'm just popping that on my cheeks like I said and then I'm just gonna melt everything into the skin by setting everything down this is the Milani make it last setting spray and then I'm gonna pop on my lip combo this is the nude sticks lip and cheek pencil in the shade whisper one of my favorite nude colors ever and then I'm gonna pop on some gloss on top this is the pop over glossy lip in the shade moonchild and that completes this video guys thank you so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye", "KktxcKrJfkI": "[Music] [Music] [Music]

"dYAQQCDqDd0": "hey guys welcome to the secret history living inside your aquarium whoa so today what we are going to be talking about is how to take one line of shrimp and how to breed that into another line or color variant now people do this for all sorts of reasons a lot of times people will just call shrimp calling means to separate to shrimp to get rid of undesired traits or sickness phenotypes which is how a shrimp looks versus genotypes which is how a shrimp is genetically and so maybe the shrimp don't live as long so that would be a genotype you would select to get rid of whereas the phenotype would be how they look so like this one for my colony is far too dark so this is a blue dream shrimp from Lucas Brett's and I wanted to show you another interesting phenomena and that is what happens when you mix two different blue shrimp neo caridina from different sources so originally all my blue dream shrimp looked something like let's see here like this color blue this was as dark as they get and the body there is the lighter blue the head is a little darker just because of the angle with the light but that was the color and that is the color that's sought-after so if we if we hop down here the sought-after colors you can see are in the brighter blues and so if we if we stir up get out some of these these shrimp you can see the brighter blues right you guys can all see that so what I've done here is I've been breeding the Blue Dream shrimp alright you see them eating there's a shrimp eating a tiny planaria don't see that every day I always hear people complaining about the other way interesting and in this tank over here I have been I got some blue dream shrimp from aquatic arts they looked the exact same as these blue dream shrimp sorry guys you see how dirty the glass is when you when you have a shrimp tank where they eat the algae off the glass but I took and a blue dream and they look almost identical to these guys I can't show them to you right now because they don't exist anymore that generation is gone and now they are this generation so in here you see this guy here this guy right on the piece of green lettuce now he's right in front of it so while certain it actually he has translucent qualities now he is turning into a really or Riley blue shrimp now he came from a mutation there's a plan area in there maybe they'll eat it no they probably won't that's way too big now also you can see what's going on here this is that really or Riley we're gonna go with Riley or actually let's go with really this video will go with really so that really coloration is actually blue and that is a translucent flesh with a little bit of a mutation that causes a blue look so that's not so much the shell on these ones as it is the actual flesh color of the shrimp it has a translucent blue kind of it really just scatters light it's not a blue flesh it's a clear flesh but just like a the sky scatters blue light more so than the other colors and reflects it that it's it's something more akin to that so the other day in another video let's hop over here I told you guys that blue dream shrimp came from several well blue shrimp in general came from several different sources so in the wild these are all neo caridina and you've also got Neil Carradine Appel Matta and that's where you get your blue pearls so those ones have that clear color gene that we're talking about they also have the white clear so that's really really clear where there's no light reflective property to it that just shows you the blue now these can interbreed with any of the others and down in here people have bred things like the they've bred the white pearls and the blue pearls or yellow pearls they've interbred those with various different shrimp so most of the shrimp that you guys are familiar with would be the Neo caridina Davy died and that would be a red mutation originally in the wild they had this rusty red orange red brown mutation and carefully over time people selected for more and more solid red brighter and brighter red and got rid of every shrimp that wasn't super bright you know his brightest female and the brightest male you could have color wise together let's see can we get this color to be more true that was the goal and does it get better if I do this guys or worse probably worse all right we'll just let it be all right so then over here we have Shoko shrimp which are also neo caridina Davy died the ndnd but in the wild instead of being rusty red these ones actually are black or charcoal gray and they weren't a super super dark wild color they were more just kind of translucent gray spotted speckled and they actually had a mutation to turn into Shoko which is chocolate in Japanese and so I don't know if that's an exact translation but we call those chocolate so they the Shoko people bred to become solid brown so they ten and then they had darker colors and then all of a sudden there is a mutation from dark brown to blue diamond which is dark dark blue with a light spot in the middle so it's getting close to a really or Riley however it's not translucent so it's not actually scattering light it actually has blue pigment so this blue pigment transfers down from a blue diamond to a blue dream now blue diamond is a very unstable line you're not gonna have tons of those breeding it's kind of an intermediate between chocolate or we also have carbon that should be here so all the black shrimp are actually either super red or super super blue but they're not actually black that's not a natural pigment color that they have so what you see here is the blue dreams they can kind of branch off here and they can make the black rose or carbon whatever you want to call them but there's a clearer version which is a carbon really and then there's the blue carbon and that is when it keeps the blue that it had from the blue diamond that slight blue pigment also there's been interbreeding all the way across the line where people have bred these into there and if you look here these are all cherry shrimp here they're just different grades different qualities of red cherry shrimp all stemming from the really mutation you can also get the mutation of blue with red and and that's just because the red is actually blue with another like red pigment and some yellow pigment there's only like four colors in the shrimp's skin that's actual pigment and when you get rid of the yellowish colored one the it's like an orange or a yellow depending on the while then you're left with a blue which and if you don't have that yellowish and fiery red these colors don't mix like you'd mix the color pallette they mix genetically and very differently but what your end up you will end up with is a blue jelly so that is a blue jelly that would be genetically different completely you see how far off these are to the blue dream and then from the blue dream supposedly now this this gets fishy about this chart which I didn't make this chart I must say but they say a blue jelly could turn into a blue carbon really which just means that it would start getting darker tips which that can happen to any of these shrimp like all these shrimp they have the potential to start getting dark colors or light spots or speckles it just happens and while breeding we try to get rid of those so that a line is pure or true so that each generation kind of comes out the same and you know what you're gonna get so over here the Bloody Mary shrimp that I've talked to you guys about and in the last video where I showed you the the blue dream that it died and its body was actually like this pink salmon color right underneath the blue that's that's an effect of that light scattering thing that I was talking about so the flesh underneath that all blue dream shrimp is actually gonna be this pink salmon color and it's kind of like when you cook the shrimp it changes color when they die it has a different color and when the outside pigment of their shell is no longer being updated with electrical little impulses and chemical signals that keep those pigments in place what they do is they suck all the nutrients out of those shells before they mutate before they're ready to shed their their skin so they pull all those pigments that they can back in and they'll put that into the new shell now if they dye those those compounds just break down rather quickly water soluble type thing you just see the flesh underneath so even though it looks like a translucent blue one it'll look like a translucent pink one and the difference in a true Bloody Mary is it will stay blood red underneath so that flesh has turned and the same thing is going on with these really dark ones with the carbons and things when you find their body it's usually a dark red so you have a blue over it and that's actually a layer of light red or pink under the blue makes it look darker it's kind of funky it's kind of like stacking clear colors of glass on top of each other but what I've done in this tank here let's scoot this to the side because I've actually selected four let's see if this works I've actually selected for the shrimp with the qualities that I want to make real ease and so I took shrimp from aquatic arts which were just fine blue dream shrimp and I mix them with the ones from Lucas breads and now you can see let's zoom it a bit more now you can see that some of them are showing signs of pigmentation changes and let's get that there we go so some of them are very light you see this one over here very light this one very dark but if you look ever so carefully there's a light spot in it so this is going to have the really O'Riley tendency right here this one as does this one has the tendency for lightness but I don't want just light and this one has exactly the opposite of what I want it has dark in the center a light spot and then dark on half of its tail so these ones are all my quote unquote calls and this happens because they weren't all bred together they were different lines and they grew up differently so this shrimp right here that just started pushing through see this one I was saying it has multiple stripes since it's not a crystal shrimp that's not a desirable pattern if I could get a bunch of shrimp to have that pattern right there that would be quite something blue with two stripes but it's just not a pattern that seems to be passed down very often in the shrimp world so right here you can really see the different colors that are all coming from the same two parents which is supposedly two blue dream strains that were clearly made some different some different ways some some path from this chart was was deviated from and maybe somebody crossed a blue pearl which is Appel Mota in all the way here or maybe they did it up here or maybe you know one it followed this path blue dream blue velvet blue velvet is a clear but very bright blue whereas the blue dream is more of like a like solid blue like a like dark glass only slightly translucent and the blue jelly is completely translucent so all those things considered they still have that urge to for some reason mutate into having the little line but what you have to do is you have to select one to make sure that your line stays pure when you're breeding shrimp but two to make sure you're getting the traits you want so these shrimp if they just kept breeding with each other they might just divert divert right back or revert right back to the same old wild-type shrimp that you know cherry shrimps are from originally but because I'm carefully taking care of them and separating them we're gonna give these certain ones that have the traits I want that look like right like blue realese or blue Riley's and we're gonna let them live together and hopefully breed together so the ones with those stripes are living up here here you can see another one and I know that light is so different but this one has a dark head and a light to Aaron in a dark tale with a light midsection so then I'll let these breed then I'll take their babies and if I was very serious about this I would get rid of all fish just so you know get rid of all fish and I would let those babies breed however they however they ended up breeding and take the most extreme cases of the really gene and then I would breed those together and then I would also probably keep a line just doing whatever it does here for the next generation or two and I would breed this back with these ones once they were reliably breeding several generations down as blue release and that would strengthen the diversity so they're not all just coming from a couple of one and one female one male so they have a line that's diverse but right now they're just hanging out and you can see some have more mutations than others and I've also keeping an eye out for just interesting mutations like I said like this one right here that just has a crazy blue pattern I mean have you guys seen much like that in in the stores so it'd be nice if we could figure out how to stabilize that pattern possibly but I don't know that will happen so in the meantime I just wanted to show you guys how this goes and then how I'm picking out what I'll selectively breed and from what we know which sometimes is changing because a lot of companies that bred these shrimp were they were proprietary they didn't want other companies to know what they mixed to get these colors of blue dream shrimp or crystal shrimp or really or Riley shrimp you know they didn't want people to know that and so they lied or they you know just casually said oh I mixed this in this and we get a lot of untrue or just unknown provenance of how this so that's what I wanted to show you we're gonna loosely follow these charts in assuming that if I keep breeding more blue jellies you know or blue carbon blues like if they get blood super dark and they still have a light spot we're just gonna keep doing that we're gonna look for the light spot as the tray now some may throw that are super dark well then I'll put them to the side and hopefully in another tank we can start doing carbons or if they're doing the dark so dark that it looks black with the what light spot will probably separate those from the blue carbon release just to keep them so they're not too many traits being played with at once but ideally I'd like to have as close to clear white with a very nice blue you know a very bright blue velvet or blue dream color shrimp so that's what's going on here I gotta separate these guys back down in here this is the mothership as it were and you can see this is the dark the dark side the the the darker blues and they're just doing their thing and you know and they're living with the Panda loaches and so forth some of them do have slight coloration changes here like where you see that that that head is darker quite a bit than the body you have to kind of decide what your cutoff is gonna be if you have all the room in the world go ahead and take that and say that it might be a really but for me that is as long as it makes mixes with another shrimp that's like a solid blue like these ones it'll be okay and sometimes those colors change just because of diet nutrition the color of the substrate below and all sorts of things like that so I hope you guys learned a little something I hope that clarifies a little something it doesn't confuse things more and I'm sorry about the camerawork it's just a little rough to do this on my own year balancing the flashlight the camera and the computers and all these shrimp this guy is actually flexing this gal trying to get rid of her exoskeleton in her shell so she could shed which then she she will probably become buried and have babies and be breeding they always shed right before they're gonna have babies because their shells don't grow so they have to get the biggest one possible so they get rid of the old small one they swell their flesh with water and then they get the shell built around it and once that starts then they can kind of Unseld and that shell they have some space to grow even with babies but here you can really see there are a couple like this guy that are definite really or Riley this gal right here - shrimp contenders and we're gonna put them together then take their babies away so there's no confusion which generation and go from there so I'll see you in the funny pages and see how this turns out with all the fish and things going on it's gonna take a lot longer it's a lot more work and it's hard to find any oddballs like you should really do a very stark tank with hardly anything it except maybe some pail yes to a certain something you can take out an emotion like one hand fall because that way you don't find the babies hiding and carry your trait you don't want later so I hope you guys take care of your animals the the critters you have the plants you have and the people around you and also take care of yourselves because you know that's important too so that you can keep doing all the rest if you want to take care of the channel you can always help feed and get front of the line for when you want plants or something to breed a shrimp fish so on and so forth or help guidance one on

relative humidity hovers around 60% this caused her to develop a nasty case of powdery mildew in the seventh week a flower that I've been fighting ever since I decided to cut her down early but anyway on to the actual review Blue Dream is the popular sativa dominant eye of the virgin I've seen a lot of descriptions of its origins online I honestly don't know enough about the stray to actually comment on that from what I understand it is for the most part considered to be a cross between DJ shorts blueberry and a haze plant in my experience the sweet produce a bit similar to blueberry that finishes the hidden spice and it has a slightly sweet for me Blue Dream has been absolute joy to grow she's a high yielding class produces very large flowers and despite the problems that I had a powdery mildew on this room she's rather disease resistant she's quick to grow but not too quick and responds very well to fruiting because of this you can maintain her at a pretty decent height because of how easy it is to brothers Freddie I highly recommend and because of its popular in the end this plant managed to yield 2 grams up to three ounces pretty decent my opinion if you've been

that haven't been following along and haven't really updated this garden in a while I think last time I updated it was when we flipped this garden to flower actually but you can see where we far surpassed that or actually I'm thinking around the sixth week in this garden now but for those guys that have not followed along this is a 6000 watt adjusting garden it's in approximately like a 10 by 20 space and there's 25 plants in here only intended to have 24 but I gave him one snare and he actually just threw it in the middle and she's got the biggest [ __ ] butt out of all of them which is hilarious but yeah there's 25 plants in here and you know things have just been looking really great you know the buds are getting big they're getting nice and frosty see I think I kind of briefly touched on the nutrients that we were running last time but I'll just kind of go roaming in really quick is we've got we're running the house and garden AME base with the bud candy at one point another we ran all of these the roots accelerator the budding so top booster don't think we're using shooting power this time we are using the overdrive but he also is running a liquid karma and hikers I'm you know but should get good stuff and you know with the addition of you know the three additional lights this grow I'm doing a mono crop style grow with all the same strain you know a little bit of updated on the the nutrients you know we definitely converted this grow to 100% cocoa like I've done in my rooms and it's made all the difference in the world for the success of this garden you know I've been really happy with the way this canopy has turned out you know it's really even and believe it or not guys this is only my buddy's second grow the last grow that I showed you with the Blue Dream in the purple cushion here under a few thousand watts was his first grow and that was really just with me helping him set up the garden kind of showing him what you need to do and you know do it himself and this time I haven't been here at all since the last video you know so he's done all six weeks by himself and yeah guys I mean it just looks great some of these buds are even bigger than ones I've done without co2 if you look at this big fattie thing definitely got some time to go looking great so basically what I extracted to do if you wanted me to see how far away they were from being finished and in my opinion there I think there are news that they're on bad day 43 or 44 in the moment so he's going to actually give these plants for one more feeding of the overdrive and after a couple days is gonna start diluting that solution down into just kind of reduce the concentration a little bit as we wind towards the end of this grow and yes so we are basically shooting for about a 60 to 63 day harvest in this room which is going to put it right on line with a lot of my other blue Dreamgirls in the past so you know I'm really excited to see the bro you know I think it's definitely more successful growth in the past so I think that's pretty much it you know he has added a couple small things you know we've got another fan of here on this wall now isolating you got another fan up there on that wall back there oscillating we also added in let's get back here got it in a an intake right here so all the we've got a the 8 inch exhaust back here in this corner and any negative pressure that's created is brought in through this fresh air duct here from the garage and then all of the air Kushner's and heaters are set on opposing schedules and what that means is you know that this small 12,000 BTU wall not on this side is keep that it keeps it cool when it's running or when the lights are on and during the winter time we've got this guy which is a 24,000 I think and that works as a heater to keep the room nice about 65 68 degrees during the lights-off cycle which is about exactly where you want it that helps keep the the blood density really nice and tight so that's basically you know all we've got going on in this grow you know it's gonna be a couple more weeks and then we should be looking at harvest and once we get the numbers and everything we will keep you guys all updated and I'm not sure exactly we're gonna grow in here next it's probably gonna be a company either of another round of you dream or the the Green crack I'm not exactly sure yet it's gonna really depend on my clone numbers cuz I just don't know what the hell I'm gonna do yet so yeah guys I think that's basically it oh yeah one other addition was I got a little diamond fire right here in the back just to keep things in check but the conditions in this room geysers awesome never emitting spike or temperature spike so these blue jeans are definitely doing very well very very happy with this garden right now so if you guys have any questions please let me know other than that we will see you guys next time you", "pP55GfFSkHY": "well here's my secret for getting

[Music]", "U8cNDf6RoWE": "so today is the day shrim have arrived I don't want this to be melodramatic okay the shrimp have arrived they're over there on the table we'll get to the unboxing in a little bit what I do want to talk about is if you saw my last video I basically went over a current my current situation a co-worker of mine bought shrimp Forrest tank recycled so I helped I tried to help out by preparing one of my tanks with my old filter media instead of putting it in my 55 which is fish that'll actually eat these little dudes my three options are put them in the 55 put them inside the fry cage right there or put them in my 6 gallon which isn't cycled yet I'm really just disappointed I was hoping it would be cycled by now but with such short warning it just it wasn't possible I tried everything I add back I added back to back to back through ayyy I added seek hims is instability the one that adds the bacterial cultures and stuff like that I added that I used my old filter media nothing doing the one thing I never considered was option D this is option D option D this is a external hob aquarium add-on by Phenix and it's something that I saw online and I just had to go try and find luckily there was a store that had one in stock essentially all it really is is like a quarantine / a hospital tank that you might be able to keep Guppies and stuff like that in but for my purpose it has its own filtration and I'll be able to put that on the the 55 gallon what what I'm probably gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and set this up off camera and have this ready for for when I actually do put the shrimp inside as you can see here all it really is is a few plastic pieces these are little plastic separators that you can put you know in between the tank this looks like just a basic cover it comes with a air return valve I'll have to look through this stuff oh actually it comes with a little uh that's pretty cool so we'll be able to put it I'll put all this stuff together you don't really need to see that part and hopefully I can have this set up and ready to go for the tank I am back I just finished installing the finnex hang on the back filter as you can see all this really is is a basic plastic box with a little pump right there so what you see here in the back is my blue net this is a little small one that I use for little things and I had to use this because it was really hard to tell but right here between the waterline and the top of the plastic line is very small super small you there's no room no them at all and because of that if this thing is tilted anymore back this way then it almost looked like water is on the edge if I were to put a single shrimp in there water will come out finally before we go deal with the shrimp one last thing I like to do is put in my sub water tank I don't know if I'm pronouncing that correctly at all inside this tank now I've had it here inside my little fry container or I don't know two days now and I'm just going to let the shrimp deal with this it actually started to brown just a little bit prior once I got the shipment but since then it's actually started turning green pretty well I do have plans on attaching it to half a coconut that I've got I've got two two halves or a whole I guess and they will be able to play with this now I really you know I don't want okay hold on hold on I know I don't really want the sub water tank to be right in the the flow so they came with these fancy dividers that I was talking about earlier man I did not plan this well at all hey hey hey no move out of the way good nope yes I'm talking to aquatic plants is wrong with me I just got off work I'm super tired okay it's not going down all the way I don't know if I have this in the right way there's little notches on the bottom that it should be able to groove with but this should be good I'll deal with this for now we've got our plants we've got a little bit of substrate we don't have direct flow on to it but we've got enough and this should be good so without further ado let's get to the shrimp what I wanted to do and this is kind of in twofold reasons one just in case there are any issues with these shrimp recording it always helps with the dead on arrival process I just hope that's not the case and second of all I just want to record the the unboxing [Music] yep I'm cutting towards myself deal with it Oh God dust everywhere oh okay well you know look at all this stuff I'm so I put my cat in the other room because I just couldn't handle the meowing while I was work well I was doing this and this stuff would drive him absolutely crazy I mean a plus on the packaging yeah you can't really see us you can actually see it in the camera oh god I really should get a mask for this okay what is this we typically send a 20% extra livestock on top of what you order just in case there are problems okay there should be 15 I'm real quick this is David and Krystal with aquatic arts definitely check them out their customer service was really on point so let us go ahead and I'll read this later myself just so we know there were there are supposed to be 15 dream blue velvet neo Kara Deena's in here so let's kind of begin oh this stuff just falls apart good job on the packaging seriously oh yeah there are some other stuff in here this is what I so here's here's object number one believe this is a chola would chew Allah would I'm probably pronouncing that incorrectly man these pieces are awesome look at these got like you know curved angles I just assumed that there would be straight pieces but this is this is some good stuff all right well we'll look at this stuff later I'll put this aside let's be honest we're all here for one particular reason okay we've got okay this is a heating pad you can feel it it's actually still warm I'm kind of surprised okay I can't handle this dust there's so much stuff that we got to get in and get out okay so the shrimp were kind of pushed up oh wait no this isn't shrimp I guess there's a plant in here too he didn't tell me about this this looks like a what like a wisteria got some browning on it but okay guys we have some what I believe is wisteria I could be wrong anyone uh let me know if you can take a look it looks pretty nice to be honest I'm pretty excited but I wasn't expecting to be doing a bleach dip here soon but we'll get to that later let's actually find what we're here for Oh God I really should have worn a mask seriously this isn't even a joke okay we have the bag got it by the rubber band right here okay let's remove some of this dust very gently and let's push this oh god some fall on the floor let's push this back you'll want to knock something off the table and we'll set this down okay we are back I grab myself a nice pair of scissors because I figured cutting with a cheap-ass knife like this was a bad idea let's go ahead and start opening up this package I actually saw a glimpse on the side I did see some life she's good how do you want to take this out okay let's let's get this stuff out first just little bit of paper towel do you see movement oh boy all right so it looks like there are multiple packages here is the first one it's gonna be really hard to tell you can see right here some little shrimps I can't really get a good shot we'll get some later but it looks like they're doing okay there's a little bit of this gelatin type material in there a little bit of what looks like a kind of moss but let me do a quick count we've got one two three four five six six shrimp they all look in great condition and they're very pretty and all right let's set these guys over here there are more and again these are blue dream Velvets honestly I don't really know what the difference is between blue dream velvet blue you know like all those kind of depictions let's turn this over okay so again we've got some live and well looking shrimp three four five six again six so we have about well shrimp thus far these guys have such a cool color of blue there's some that have a lighter color let me see this okay good one looked like he was stuck underneath a little material but he should be fine let's go lay this out flat they have a little bit of room to maneuver and it looks like we have one more because again there should be 15 total they said they had about what is it twenty percent more just in case of dead-on-arrival x' which would be unfortunate okay well these guys are moving oh man we've got one two three four five six six four six they're all moving there are two in here though that look a little bit odd so if you look I'll try to get a shot later on but there's two in here that are brown rather than blue I don't think it's the difference between male and female but in any case we have three bags six each based on my elementary math that is 18 little shrimps and so that being said let's go ahead and do a drip acclimation so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna put these shrimp inside the bucket we'll start the process and we should be good to go [Music] [Music] are doing their thing I feel a little bit self-conscious about putting my camera right in here but hopefully you can get a somewhat decent look we're going to go ahead and start the drip acclimation right now okay so I've got the top input in the tank I've got the end so let's go ahead and begin mmm there we go okay so we've got the things started now unfortunately I have absolutely no hands to be able to tie this off so I'm gonna do a quick Bend stop the flow and be slightly insightful and add this in one hand okay we're good so we've got the flow right so now what we want to do is go ahead and tie this and it just a little knot okay so we what I'm looking for is about like maybe two to three drips a second let's do a little bit looser okay so this is about what I'm looking for you can kind of see it right there that's that's what I made it aiming for so I'm gonna go ahead and leave this here this is gonna acclimate probably for a good hour just until at least some of the parameters inside this water which I did take down prior to this are the same as my tank that's what I want to do and this will help with temperature this will help with water parameter shock you know that kind of stuff and so I will see you guys in a little bit hey guys welcome back so I've just let the shrimps acclimate for about an hour actually a little bit over an hour and if you take a look you can see what level has risen actually quite a bit if you compare between the original shot and this one they seem to be doing okay so what we're gonna do now is we are going to take them from the bucket and put them inside my little hang on the back tank so let's go ahead and do that right now [Music] well guys that's pretty much it so what have we done today we've assembled a fourth option that hopefully will keep the shrimp alive I'm really hoping that's the case that's basically what my goal is gonna be for the next week or two hopefully until the six gallon is completely cycled until it's ready to go and won't be a deathtrap is basically what I'm trying to get at but they look like they're doing good they're starting to eat a little bit they're probably stressed so they're not gonna eat a whole lot I put a little food in there because typically breeders will starve animals for a day or two prior for their own good they do it because they don't want them to poop in the water they don't want ammonia to be released they don't want them to basically kill themselves via poop I'll give you constant updates there's some stuff that came in that package like the coconut half shells the Chola what actually the coconuts didn't come there and that was something else the Chola would I don't if I'm pronouncing that right um Aloha I don't want a cholo would it's like a Mexican gangster wrote wood I don't know but we'll go from there we'll do what's right for these shrimp will hopefully get them set up so my coworker can take them I don't know when maybe a month from now three weeks whenever his tank is cycled that would be ideal and then my project starts with the 220 gallons so I hope you guys really enjoyed this video I enjoy making it if you enjoyed this video hit that subscribe button follow me follow along on my adventure of hopefully not committing trip

Our soul-healing goddess, Park Kiyoung. (Number 2 - Park Kiyoung) You must've really said that. - It used to be really bad. / - I had no idea. You've been a singer for so long yet you suffered from stage fright? I never would've guessed. There's no way someone who suffers from stage fright could hold her pitch for that long.

say that this chart has come from petrol source that I've tracked down somewhat breeder distributor and hobbyists so there have been a lot of charts floating around out there I had another chart it wasn't quite as clear the direction in which we have selectively bred shrimp and this is stemming everything from you know blue velvet shrimp Sakura yellow Sakura shrimp green jade shrimp blue really black rose carbon bloody marys chocolate choclo orange red really painted fire Bloody Mary you name it so all those neo caridina shrimp that you know and love are in this chart and the chart has been changing so I posted a video a few months back and that chart was a little bit confusing in that it had arrows kind of coming and going and kind of maybes and ifs this one is laid out a little more clear there's still a bit of I guess questionable lineage going on but geneticists and hobbyists are trying to figure out what's what exactly is what because this selective breeding process is actually relatively new in the cherry shrimp or neo caridina shrimp project so to speak as humans have undertaken so throughout the history of this we only have a short time since the mid-90s that people were intensively selectively breeding these for the hobby so in the wild you have basically pal Mata and David I that have come to be part of what we usually see in pet stores and online in forums and things as neo caridina shrimp now cherry shrimp were the first to hit the market later followed by really shrimp and blue shrimp and so this chart kind of shows that transition but there are several wild types so there's the rusty red wild type then there's the wild Shoko which is like a darker coloration type and then there's also a lighter orange like yellowish wild type that you find in the wild and then there are also the PAL Mata variations which give you all your pearls blue pearls white pearls and then there are also hybrids of those mixed in with any given other Davey dye selection of shrimp so let me go through this a little bit in 1997 in Taiwan breeders were starting to play with this line here they got shrimp down into Sakura rhetta's hobbyists 1999 was the first time that really all of Asia Japan started really getting serious about breeding these before people had neo caridina shrimp basically in their aquariums and things as a filter cleaner shrimp kind of thing and kind of The Naturalist look inside of nature style tanks but they weren't bred for the bright colors intentionally anyhow although many hobbyists did see that you could select for certain traits like stripes or solid patches or clear patches and from there it really exploded and because they reproduce so quickly you know they can get pregnant every 30 to 45 days in theory and even though that's not generally how it works for each female but and then they can have you know anywhere from 15 to 30 babies easily and then those grow up within it maybe three months there at reproduction age so in a given year you can one hobbyist if they have enough tanks can actually get pretty far in this as shown by how far the variants have come in the last since well since last 20 years really is what we're talking about 1998 being even earlier so that they hit the scene in 2002 November they were brought into the country and from their 2003 red cherry shrimp were available they weren't really graded in a coherent system until a little later on but now we have all these other variants so let's go through some of these variants if you're just getting into shrimp this chart should help you if you're a hardcore breeder you may have information that I do not have and keep in mind that a lot of people sourced their shrimp and they may have a Bloody Mary that's a low caliber assuming it's a red and then it throws a chocolate which throws a blue two generations later and then reverts back to a chocolate looking one and so while you're seeing these arrows pointing in one direction they also work the other way so anywhere down this line it can revert back to these wild source types and they're not different species but they're different phenotypes fino meaning how it looks on the outside and genotype being what it's made of genetically in its DNA and those two things could differ pretty wildly you can have a red shrimp that is from this lineage or you could have a red shrimp that is from this one so the information is a little confusing because some people may have thought that they had you know cherry shrimp and it turns out that they had Bloody Marys and then they're using that information to say that they bred blue Velvets or something along those lines so and as you can see here they all have the same genetics as a species this part of the chart these are separate slightly from a common ancestor but there's a path here to blue velvet which kind of is blue dream or blue velvet depending on who you ask kind of the pinnacle of the blue series topaz also being another name and also some people argue that there are blew pearls crossed with blue dreams which make a blue topaz I don't know the truth on that and I haven't gotten it sorted out but hopefully genetics will get this sorted out soon and let's talk about it from this big old mess that I've just said is impossible to sort out for sure and talk about what we do know so this chart here start with the wilds that are rusty selectively breed them redder and redder until you see that their legs are growing actual red on them and then their shells other exoskeletons are becoming less and less see-through so they're becoming opaque as we say and at a certain point painted red fire red you've got this bright bright red but a deep red and you can't even see through to see a saddle or eggs being carried and that's kind of the highest grade within that it splits off into two more based on body style and a few other details but we won't go into here with ease and s's being grade systems within the pinnacles of each of these shrimp you see on the list so basically we do know that the wild cherry shrimp or the wild neo caridina debut dye that we have turned into cherry shrimp it got redder and redder and at any point in time here it's also thrown red really shrimp and that is a shrimp with the clear spot since normally they have little stripes of clear they through these and so that was another early shrimp that came out onto the scene and people selectively bred for more and more of that clear spot less and less of red until it was divided into two so from there that clear spot began to show signs of blue as that red gets deeper the pigment actually has blue in it too to make the red appear as more of a royal red or a blood red it has a little bit of blue mixed in with the color in the pigmentation so from there people got rid of the red and created blue jellies now some people will argue that blue jellies also have a lineage in pal Mata I don't know the answer to that but I do know that this path is one that is possible and so from the painted fire Reds we also have such dark Reds that they start to look black but that occurs more in my experience with the blue shrimp so when you have a blue dream shrimp or a blue diamond they're coming from a brown chocolate shrimp and some people will say the Shoko or wild choco is chocolate shrimp but they're they're selectively bred so they're either a dark brown bronze or a dark dark chocolate color or a light chocolate color and then from there you go down and they start showing blue and then they start showing more and more blue as the red is weeded out from back here wild-type wise and as they're selectively bred you end up down here with blue velvet on the far end and blue dream being the apex of this lineage strip here and you lose the yellow and you gain the red from the game the blue from the brown coloration that is in their pigmentation from there at any point really this chart is a bit deceiving you can also get really shrimp splitting off so the realese can happen anywhere and a lot of times they look weakly colored like the pigment on the other ends of the shrimp will be weakly colored but you'll get that Center strip with either clear as a carbon really is or as blue as the blue carbon really czar and I think I love both of those but they're a bit interchangeable and often times your blue shrimp if they're not a super pure line can throw kind of odd really combinations or Riley combinations from now let's talk quickly about the difference between a painted fire which is the dark royal red and Bloody Mary which actually has some flesh underneath the exoskeleton that's red and just a deeper more of a lobster like a cooked lobster red or something that not that bright cooked but the the dark red that you can see in some lobsters in the wild lobsters also happen to throw blue as do crayfish and that's because to get that deep brown it needs color combinations under its skin of yellow green blue and red and so that blue is kind of a variant similar to almost albino ISM a little different than that but similar if you want to play along so Bloody Mary's are basically the brown type that once in a while will throw the chocolates that have more of a red tint which is kind of close to the wild of these but with less translucent spots and then from there you got a striped wild shrimp and that turned into what we know is the Bloody Mary now people have crossed Bloody Marys and painted fires and muddled that all up and that's why it's tricky because when you see a lineage that ends here essentially this is the apex of the coloration being all the other colors removed you don't have the blue in there underneath the red necessarily it's just red you end up with a lot more of an intense color and so when you cross that back with something that could have blue somewhere in the line because this is not always a progression so I've been asked several times you know well if it works this way how come my blue really had a you know sakura red style shrimp baby well those genes are hidden in in there in their history in their bodies and so it can revert anywhere along with scale although most likely when you cross color types that have been kind of purified into colors that we recognize such as yellow green red blue black or white snowball or white pearl - then you end up getting a wild type and that I think that's just almost like the genes express themselves in a way that it reverts back to what's easiest when it can't figure out what's nothing it is a thinking system of genes but when there's not a completely clear dominance the genes revert so from those cherry shrimp also you get a lighter color shrimp that turned into orange realese or Riley's just like the red so you get an orange and red from that rusty color that clear spot then turns blue on this side whereas it turns more yellow on this side and starts to throw more of like a greenish yellow or a golden color and I can show you that at the very end of the video here which we're getting to but I just wanted to explain how this kind of works and then heat from here Orange throw green which is unexpected right you wouldn't think that necessarily but orange shrimp can throw green and they can also revert back to cherry or wild rusty color or wild yellow color so it's kind of an interesting little tidbit that they can do that Sakura yellow being the most intense yellow of these and kind of where that line ends there's also stripes down the back and things like that other variations that people have added to the line but that's the end of the line essentially and then from here you could also throw you can skip this step around and you can actually get from here to the green or green jade and greens are very notorious for throwing brown or yellow or you know they're not the most stable line now people are starting to get green Jade's that are more and more stable but it doesn't work like mixing paints you can't just mix red and yellow and get orange you know that's clearly not how this works down here the darkest shrimp it's assumed I've also seen that there are wild shrimps that are dark enough that they were just selectively bred straight away instead of chocolates into the Black Rose style shrimp but under this chart they're coming from either painted fire or blue dream and then they are essentially one of several variants you get either the clear or the blue in the center just as you see here with that progression of the blue jellies now blue jellies often look like weak blue dreams or blue Velvets which throw off color blue as well but I just wanted to kind of show you the breakdown of how it goes and just know that if you put a bunch of shrimp and a tank together that are a different neo caridina colors they will not mix the way you think logically as the the rest of the world works in as far as color theory goes so now let's take you real quick over to the actual shrimp pardon the shaky camera maybe we'll cover it so that y'all don't have to get dizzy but so down here we have some shrimp and I've set aside a couple for you guys to look at and so essentially these are wild types in here you can see here that this one could be considered part Shoko with that chocolate color and then in here we have red Riklis also of a low lower grade but you can see that blue being thrown and these all came from these red cherry shrimp this this brood here happened to be throws from these Reds that I've been working with for some time now you can see that some of the young ones are going to be once I select them out and grade them they're going to be lower grade because they're striped but none of these are Bloody Marys they're just very intensely colored painted fire or fire shrimp so up here let's find some more examples here we have a yellow you can see some of the yellow in there their guts up in their head essentially but you can see the black striping rather than rather than the brown striping and so that can be selected for overtime with more of those so that you're getting black and you can make a carbon shrimp also so it's a little confusing obviously here you can see one that has kind of a green brown color and so that is something along the lines of a native wild shrimp also you know from there you can select and sometimes you'll end up with something back in the cherry room right here's a prime example of the more yellowish shrimp even though that's its guts that have color and somewhat of the ovaries of the shrimp there is an actual golden Sheen to that head and stuff when you look at it closely back up in here we've got let's see if we can see from above a little clearer you can see that blue really well in this female adult red really and whereas some of the young ones that she has birthed and these guys are set aside because they're going to a pet store as low grades but some of them have very nice clear markings in between the red rather than blueish ones like this one here selectively you could take two of those and select for less and less color so it's clear and so on and so forth so that's kind of what's going on in this little mini breeder box over here we have cherry shrimp that didn't make the cut so to speak and are also going to the pet store as just plain old sherry shrimp this is probably as close like this one here as in the wild you would see to a cherry shrimp which sparks the idea of having cherry shrimp but they can easily be selected if you take the brightest of them and you can select for these now here's another interesting one which is it is technically a Blue Dream from Lucas Bret's line that I acquired and some of the babies in this brood they're all from one blue dream female all the blue babies that are in this tank and I pull the babies as soon as they start to get about yay big but they have actually because of the darker substrate here they've darkened up so that is part of their epigenetic code and that is the part of their genes that get expressed that can show later in life almost like when you go through puberty these these shrimp can change according to their environment through different hormone responses they can lighten up or darken up and so here you see more of the classic blue very young these ones are two weeks old or so sorry about the focus and you have some really good quality blues in here and then you also have some that are so dark that they're probably black and then you can see that you've got more of a wild type revert from the red colony that's an older group so up here let's take a look real quick and see if we can find any of the adult blues that I keep separate they tend to hide in the day in this tank but in any case I just wanted to try to find you one and I don't think I will be successful at this point in time so that is the the essential breakdown of the chart with the information we have today it is subject to change and if you know something different about the chart and you have selectively bred and figured out that something is a revert of something and then cross back for instance feel free to let me know I keep my adult shrimp in separate tanks by color and then I let the females hatch in this tank which has no fish it's just shrimp and snails and then in this tank once they're about half inch or maybe a third of an inch I'll throw them in this tank so I hope this helps some of you newer understand a little bit the basics of it I don't want to say that this is gospel because the issue is changing and it was also a very proprietary thing that that the shrimp were bred by different distributors and companies for different traits and so sometimes it was not divulged where they came from and that lineage was protected so just remember that if you learn something here if you like this video please give it a thumbs up think about subscribing or maybe just checking out some of my older videos and have a great day take care of your critters feel free to message me with any questions comments or changes to this I'll probably be coming out with another video as currently genetic testing is underway to figure out what's what about this snails are great in your shrimp tank by the way they eat the extra food that the shrimp don't get to this one would be a grade below painted fire she's got all red but you can still see through her in the light so I'll be getting rid of these other shrimp today they have the size too close to an adult that I don't want them to mix and ruin my line so this isn't the professional way to do it you'd want to keep every color and strain separate but I am not necessarily a professional obviously shrimp breeder I'm a hobbyist and I like to mix it up a little bit and see what I get and I don't have a million tanks I have five tanks to work with for practically so I have a blue tank a red tank a yellow tank and a wild-type tank that mixes however random hodgepodge mixes end up so these will not intermix also with caridina if everybody's wondering the PAL Mata they can and there are also some other new variants of neo caridina that people are arguing whether or not they are actual different species like the the rusty red Wilde's versus the yeah the darker Wilde's is that a whole new species I don't know we'll find out sometime so I hope you guys have a great day take here and keep on swimming talk to you next time bye", "EtzaH3AEk4M": "[Music] [Music] [Music] syndra [Music] I dream that I'm sitting on all gently float scenery like a real fast nobody niandra see we're blowing this was for smokey from the [Music]", "LMJ4ubWGWoY": "hello everybody welcome to the secret history living inside your aquarium today we're looking at my aquarium and we're gonna be talking a little bit about grading blue shrimp and blue shrimp genetics specifically neo caridina the other prominent blue shrimp in the hobby would be the blue bolt caridina shrimp and we are not looking at those today today these are neo caridina now this one while I have it while you guys can kind of see it wherever it went so you can see it's coming through quickly eating out Fuchs or biofilm little critters off of algae and so forth but you can see that its body is a bit patchy so if you were gonna grade this and this is a Blue Dream by the way it almost looks a little bit more like a blue velvet now blue Velvets tend to have a lighter tail that is translucent and there is no blue on that the part of this guy's tail which is clear or gal's tail would be a light blue ideally and the legs would also be a light blue and the head would have a little more darkness to it so as we're looking here down in the algae where all the shrimp hang out and all that you can see one that's a little more consistently blue but you might call it a blue velvet now a particular problem has developed in this hobby and that problem is that people are calling they're basically just deciding whatever they want to name a shrimp out of the popular names and they're they're calling their shrimp that whereas a blue dream technically if we take a look over here a blue dream should be from the Shoko line so wild Shoko i know you can't see a color very well on this but that is a black or brown dark brown chocolate color wild shrimp that then gets bred into a nice chocolate or golden brown neo caridina then into a blue diamond which is like it's got blue on its shoulders and blue on its tail that are really dark like almost a black and that gets bred out until it's a more solid blue just a nice navy or sapphire blue so the names sapphire blue shrimp blue dream and blue velvet have all become a little bit synonymous with the blue dream now another confusing one that sometimes people mislabeled are you have blue Riley's and some people mean that by a shrimp like this with red head and tail and a clear to blue center that descended from a line of really or Riley shrimp that basically you have a clear spot on a red shrimp and then that spot gets darker in turns to a blue from that clear and you breed for more and more of the clear spot and it gets bluer and bluer because it has those wild genes shared with the since all these shrimp are genetically related it still does have the same genes that allow the darkness in this strain here so it will use some of the coloration to darken up its clearness in some of the mutations and you'll progressively get a more and more instead of clear you'll get a more and more blue shrimp if you select for that now this can take 10 20 30 generations and it did to get to the consumer and so that's why these names are a little bit important now traditionally a blue jelly which you don't see around too much anymore is just a blue really or Riley shrimp be it a red headed and tailed Riley or blue tail and head Riley and it is just it just means a light blue translucent shrimp and we generally grade all blue shrimp in America with just a standard a or B or you know private stock or different breeders do at different ways but usually it's your a class your beat class sometimes a C class and your a class is going to be consistent and consistency and big strong shrimp is what we're looking for both the males and females exhibiting the same color be it a light color or a dark color both are worth money and people will pay 14 bucks for a really good blue jelly or a really good blue dream more realistically they're gonna be paying like at a pet shop and not from a breeder at or at a contest more realistically they're probably going to be paying something along the lines of you know five to ten dollars with me buying from Lucas Brett's for my blue dreams Jane and here you can see that blue velvet according to this chart supposedly means a lighter cross of the Blue Dream and the blue carbon really which says it can come from any of these places and that's that way on here because they don't really know there's there's David I neo caridina wild types and there's Paul Mata and then there's xanga Genesis know I might be butchering that and they're all interchangeable reproductively but they all have different traits physically so in the PAL Mata column that is a legitimate term and you those ones are clear wild like and you can get blue pearls which then turn into white pearls or snowball shrimp if you select for them to get clearer and clearer so you see here it's the same as over here the default is not necessarily a clear white color when people are trying to make really shrimp it's actually a blue translucent color which makes sense if you're trying to blend in with water and sky if you're looking up and so forth in nature but we're looking at this in spectrum here and really your blue dream is going to be a solid blue your blue velvet is going to be a solid translucent but still like sky2 classic true blue on a crayon color let's see if we can find something so this would be your blue dream blue you don't want to see any transparency you want to see that glow around the edges definitely and then let's see here if we can find another guy that's a little more ok so then we've got this one here which according to the chart this would be inching towards a blue velvet in the color tone and that being said this is a blue dream line no new shrimp lines have been been introduced and really what this is is a low-grade blue dream in my mind because of those stripes you see it doesn't have a consistent color and so I sell those wholesale for you know three bucks or two bucks and I sell them to customers usually for five to seven dollars if if I'm like trading credit or whatnot and that's just because those colors don't match the tail and the head and the body now the closer I can get to a perfect shrimp the better the other thing that I want to say real quick on here is that say for instance in this tank I've got really different color substrates there's a mix of substrates and that really throws the shrimp off to know what your shrimp truly look like you need to give them a consistent diet not let them scrounge just for whatever in a fish tank and you need to also give them you know all the vitamins and minerals they need which should be in the food if you select a good food but you also need to give them a substrate that they can feel comfortable choosing to blend in with see this one's a little higher grade just because it's more consistent we're gonna hop downstairs in one sec and we're gonna take a look at some higher grade shrimp so this guy even though he's a young baby and it's organs or what is causing the irregularity they're in between on the bend this shrimp would be a higher grade close to a grade-a because it's a nice bright blue its tail has blue on it its legs are blue its eyes are blue its antennas are blue its feelers its rostrum or its nose are blue anything that's clear on any of these types of shrimp is gonna count against for its worth but everybody has different preferences so sometimes somebody wants a blue dream somebody wants a blue pearl so it being dark or light doesn't mean that much anymore whereas it used to because the darker it was and the more consistent it was it showed that you had spent time and energy refining that line whereas now this the cats out of the bag the secrets kind of over and we have shrimp of all different sorts all over the place so let's hop downstairs real quick so I can show you a couple examples of a higher-end shrimp and that'll conclude it so let's see one sec all right guys we're back downstairs and this is a very high grade shrimp you see this it almost looks metallic this blue is a sky-blue she looks great she's got a metallic gunmetal gray to her on her tail and her legs her rostrum her antennas everything is blue it all matches it reflects the light gray and she would be a specimen that you know honestly I wouldn't even let go of her I will not let go of her you can see as she turns sideways she's just flawless on on color there it's lights reflecting from above that you're seeing on her so down here this is more of your blue velvet grade but it's really coming out of a blue dream strain and that's why you have people calling them different names and being deceitful so even though he has consistency throughout his tale pretty much he's got blue rostrum dark blue eyes you can see through his body and he's basically or she's basically I'm saying that as the shrimp is super pregnant I couldn't see it actually have a bend in it come on focus because I thought it was that skinny looking just through my camera okay so she is full of eggs right now and those eggs will have the genes of the blue dream shrimp shrimp that are in the tank so I'd be wrong of me in my opinion to sell her as a light-colored blue like a blue to call her a blue jelly or to call her a blue velvet would be wrong because she's gonna have blue jean babies that was hard to say and basically you see the Balti shrimp in here with them and there's a little bit algae on the side of a shrimp tank because that's how they like it but here are some babies that also are showing really good traits super solid blue you can see they're eating away at some little teeny tiny pellets there's some like day-old babies you can already tell that they're gonna have great color same with up there so this is like kind of my height my high-end tank and yes I'll pull that blue jelly female up but I'm gonna wait and see how her babies are before I pull him away see there I go I'm calling her blue jelly but she's really just a be class blue dream whereas that's an a class blue dream nice Navy solid blue a little bit of transparency to give it light for me it's it's balancing that equation and just getting it perfect so up here in darker light you just don't see through much of anything except for that lower part of the armor it's upside down so now it looks like the upper part but it's bellied the armor that she has there and same with the one over there so that kind of concludes and here we have another pregnant shrimp and that is a higher grade blue dream and basically if your substrate is dark they will try to become darker navy blue if your substrate is light they'll try to become light so what I do possibly foolishly because I could sell more shrimp as blue dream gray day is I put a mix I have a lot of dark substrate back in there but I have white gravel up towards the front half and some gray logs and can topple leaves and what that does is that gives me the idea of how light they can go in theory so when they're stressed in the bag when someone looks at them they're gonna see already I'll know what the lightest they go is so I'm not pulling one over on anybody you don't have to prime that shrimp under just dark substrate it's not gonna look like that in your fish tank because your fish tank has multi textures and so forth so that's kind of how the grading works guys and I hope that helps please message me if you have any questions up at the top tank here I have a few more shrimp that are low grade shrimp will see if we can even find one yeah there's one so these are grade B to me and I and as you can see it looks like a jelly again I could lie and call it a jelly but it's babies might have dark babies so basically I put them in a separate tank I monitor them and I see what kind of genes they throw there's another one that didn't make the cut he's in this tank for being too dark he's like black on his top even with a clear bottom this thing so that's the far opposite end of the spectrum of why I would keep them out of there and you know when you grade red cherry shrimp neo caridina it's a little different there's different grades and stuff but here you can see where that that defect or genetic mutation which a lot of people like that clearness is in that shrimp there and so it would be a lower grade for now but for somebody looking to breed really O'Riley shrimp they would really want that sure because it's got some clearness to it unlike the rest of these super bright red other shrimp so that is how the blue shrimp work very different than the Sakura firered all that sort of stuff that gets thrown around for red shrimp or even yellow shrimp but that's how it goes I didn't make up these rules they just seem to be the ones that were playing by so I hope that helps and thanks for asking the question to the viewer who did I don't want to out you if you don't want to be mentioned but you know who you are and thanks a lot talk to you guys

welcome to Bamber TV cart reviews a brand new segment on the channel where we review the best carts around now we normally do we'd review x' and we will have a playlist of that in the description we are also going to make a brand new playlist for these cart reviews so very exciting stuff here our first cart review is none other than blue dreams so very excited Dave what you have to say about Blue Dream Blue Dream is a west coast legend amongst weed it is a crossbreed between blue berry indica and a sativa known as haze and this dream child amongst these two makes it a very potent hybrid and of course when you think about blue dream automatically the flavor comes to mind it's one of the most flavorful strains around so I was really excited to taste this and it really stays true to the bud it's very flavorful the oil has a night nice light golden color to it so very appealing as well now the main difference between the strain and the oil is well the oil is a concentrated version of the weed itself so this oil right here is about 78 percent THC by volume and it has a couple of other good cannabinoids and high amounts in there but then the rest of the oil is known as terpenes and that's the flavor profile but all natural flavors that are in the bud itself now blue dream is known for having a lot of stress relieving properties to it as well as depression fighting and nausea preventing busts so that makes it a very good medicinal weed alright so normally I just cut to the score but Dave I have a two-part question for you today I want to know which one you prefer in terms of the weed strain or the oil strain and also of course the Bama rating me personally Pat I really enjoy the flour from Blue Dream it's been a little bit since I've smoked it however I do remember all those beautiful floral notes especially when you use it so it's one of my favorite strains to smoke as far as my Bimmer rating for this cart I mean we started off with a really really good one so we asked her to make it known that this is a really good kart right off the bat I'm gonna give this one a four out of five okay so there you go a legendary strain translating very well to a legendary oil so that is our first cart review guys if you like this video smash the like button think about subscribing and for everything else and weed and weed related keep it here on Bammer TV [Music]", "c3wRCZPDypE": "[Music] come on guys let's go EMP continuing my video series for the Blue Room a 4000 watt blue Dreamgirl which is going to consist of 16 blue dream plants let's see I've got them all right here this is again going down eight plants around what I normally do to the via 24 plants so we're definitely cutting the numbers down significantly giving these plants a lot more space to fill out I've been really aggressive on topping these plants so you can see that the canopy is extremely even all these plants are really bushy multiple heads on all these plants you know the stalks are nice and thick already and the drip system in this room again is working awesome so the today is going to mark they wanna flower these plants have been sitting in just about exactly 48 hours just a little shy of that actually of darkness so you can see that the new growth is really light because they've been sitting in darkness for two days growing with no sunlight so it just got fed for the first time in two days with the beat one of bloom newts so they should Green right back up here the next day or so and they should really started to take off now I plan for this grow on the nutrients is to run a combination of the X nutrients and the psycho and what that's going to compile is the X nutrients full line which is going to be the grow bloom micro the amino blast and the bloom FX and and then I'm gonna be running pretty much all these of psychos additives so we're gonna be running the uptake thes I'm the doctor repair and the potash right now and I gonna run pretty much all of those except for the potash all the way through and then when we get to you know probably up the fifth week or so we'll probably switch over to these swell and see how this works compared to what I've done with blue gem in the past this would be like the third nutrient line that I'm running blues dream on so I think I should have a pretty good ability to gauge you know its its results and growth rates and stuff in comparison to what I've seen in the past I have to admit that I'm really looking forward to this grow having less plants in it I think in the end it'll work out to be less work around harvest time and it also gives me the ability to really have a lot of space to walk around and check out the veins and you know just really spend a lot more out close to personal time with the plants we'll have to see how this yield holds up holds up to when I run six points the light instead of four points the light but either way you know this thing's off to a good start and I'm really looking forward to you know the results of those things so I would say that from now on it's going to be cruise control just maintaining the the reservoir and the nutrients right now for the the first week or two up flower I'm gonna keep the ppm s for the co2 down to about 800 and I want to get past about that second week I'm just going to bump the PBMs up to probably about 13 14 hundred and that's pretty much the only modification I think I'm gonna have to make I'm not sure how much light adjustment I'm gonna have to do you can see there's still probably close to two feet between the the lights and the canopy right now and you know they do obviously stretch quite a bit but I don't know how dramatic it's going to be since I was really really aggressive on topping these plants they haven't been chopped in about a week so you can clear just now starting to recover and looking really awesome so we'll have to just see how this thing goes but I plan to just throw hopefully only one layer of trellis setting and here to support this canopy and I think that's all the only thing I'm pretty much gonna have to do so yeah I think that's pretty much it we will see you guys at the next video update what's going on guys let's go MD and here making the next video for the room a 4000 watt blue dream grow and again this is the you know room that we have now taken our numbers down to 16 plants in here although it might be hard to tell because these plants are just [ __ ] huge I mean you look at them from the side and yeah they're just extremely bushy lots of main notes on all these plants and I can just tell that you know the thickness of these stems means they're just going to be donkey dick colas and I am really really happy with the way that the canopy has just naturally filled in I really like the fact that I have less numbers in here because it was you know obviously a little bit easier to manage the pre veg you know I took a little bit less resources I would say with the blue dream strain in particular a didn't take really hinder my time by having to get these planes extra because these plants just grow really really fast anyway I would say that I really like the fact that I can walk around really easily in this screw you know the canopy is really maintained and due to the fact students the thickness of these stems and these stocks already I don't think I'm really gonna need to do much trellis netting here until we start getting into the budding weeks you know which should be happening over the next two you know they're starting basically after the end of next week it'll really start getting into the heavy budding at least at this strain so I think you know once I once I kind of start noticing that these you know coalesced are waving a little bit more than they do now in the wind then I'll probably throw up the trellis net and I think one layer should do it just the extensive amount of topping has really helped these plants just get really nice and sturdy so I think that with this strain particularly I will probably repeat this method only doing for plants perlite and I might even experiment trying this with a couple of my other strains but that's yet to be determined so yesterday the reservoir pretty much started to run out and I filled the reservoir up with fresh water gave them one quick feeding you know fresh water and then you know made them made up at new rez and what that basically compiled is for this run I don't know if I mentioned it on the percent but I'm going to be running the pull X nutrients line along with all of the psycho additives so what this week calls for is eleven hundred milliliters of the X bloom 825 of the X micro and the it's amin oblast and and then on the psycho side we have 250 milliliters of potash 200 milliliters of uptake design and dr. repair we also added 250 milliliters of silica blast and 500 milliliters of sweet raw and it's pretty much gonna do it for this week and the Blue Dream I know it can really take some pretty heavy feedings I'm not gonna really be topping off my reservoir right now I'm feeding them in line with what I I'm running on the green cracks right now and depending on how they look if they still look you know just as green and healthy and no burn and then everything as they do right now then I might up my PBMs from a little bit more than what it already calls for cuz it calls for a steady increase in the bloom for the first three weeks so I will probably do a little bit experimenting with that but as always I'll let you guys know what I end up throwing in the reservoir so this room is on cruise control the drip system has made all the difference in the world for me in terms of my management of these gardens the automation has made all of my room my firearms pretty much hands-free - filling up the reservoir which I'll have to do is turn this started hooked up to a flow valve and then I add the nutrients and then you know every other week I take that whole thing out clean it so but other than that you know the controller maintaining all my levels exactly where I need them I think I have my temp threshold set at about 80 to 83 degrees which is usually kicks a little bit lower than that it just runs a little bit harder because these sensors a little bit closer to the light but either way we're running the PPM's all the way up at 1350 right now yeah running with my 1350 just let them have it and I'll probably bump that up to about 1500 next week or so I'd say but controller keeping all my temperature humidity and everything in check and yeah that's basically it for now so not a whole lot going on in terms of development I can see they're just now getting ready to start you know popping out with pistols so I think by the next video we should have a little bit more interesting and interesting setup to look at and I have a 100% decided if I'm gonna go back in here and remove more of this undergrowth you know a lot of this stuff even though it's on the it's on the sides it's getting a lot of light but on some of them you know where it's interfacing it's not so I might pull these plants out of here and give them a nice you know lolli popping probably at the end of next week you know as usual when manigott I got through my second week of flower I typically come through one more time and clean them all up and just really try to get as much of the shrubbery and what would ultimately become those popcorn buds and those big major families that aren't gonna get any light and just kind of fall off anyway because we lacked nitrogen and that would really help you know promote all the growth upwards so that'll probably be the next step that'll probably be the net only change between now the next videos I'll pull this plants out one last time lollipop boom put them back in give them a little time to recover throw up a trellis net and it's rocky roll for the rest of the cycle it's not gonna be a problem and the thing that's really awesome about the drip system is that because I'm not using those emitters that actually puncture into the pot the tubing just kind of sits on it and then I have just one little small metal hook to just kind of hold the clip or the hold up to in place I can pull these plants out in here really easily and I don't have to [ __ ] with my drip system all that much or you know risk pulling the emitters out of the pots and pull it you know that can damage the root zone stuff too so this is kind of a hands hands off you know version of my drip system compared to what the roots I've had to deal with in the past so yeah so far so good guys we'll be we'll be back probably next week - next time alright guys what's going on back with the next video update here from 4000 watt room a which is the blue dream group featuring an ex and psycho nutrients together what I feel will be very very successful growth today we're getting the videos back on track putting today at 8:15 the first day of week three or the conclusion of week two however you want to look at it but we have three flowers and websites starting to come in not a whole lot of you know bras or anything really showing it to day 15 but you can definitely see that it's gonna be a nice full canopy he's got a lot of bad side strolling out looking really [ __ ] awesome really liking the way this room is looking at least with this particular string using for plants for light I think that the plains definitely respond better they spread out and allowed a lot more room for each of these colas and these buds is going to be massive I know last video I promised I would probably have the trellis netting up by now but I haven't really needed to do any are having needed to worry about the canopy moving at all because these stems on these colas was so thick you look at that compared to my thumb all the way here that's super thick so these blood sites are not really moving at all granted I do think that when they start to get real heavy we start having these big you know donkey dick colas here on the on these buds then I probably will need to build up a trellis net so I would imagine within the next week couldn't go much more than one or two more weeks max before they'll really really needed that so today is reservoir change day we ran out yesterday and I cleaned it out replaced it with a fresh one gave him one feeding of fresh water and today came in topped him off one more time and he went ahead and added the next few nutrients and what I did is put in twelve hundred milliliters of the X bloom 825 milliliters of the X micro and the amino blast and then I also put in 275 milliliters boom effect so we're starting that here you know about the third week at the recommendation of X nutrients you know their test grower that's his recommendation so we're starting that and we're also now going to continue off with the rest of our cycle additives which when we stepped up the potash or this week started in three hundred milliliters of potash 250 milliliters of silica blast 500 milliliters of sweet raw and then 200 milliliters of uptake as I'm and doctor pair so like I said the full X line and every out of it from psycho with the actually I'm the only one I'm not using this b-1b that's because I don't have enough to run it all the way through so anyway but yeah you know so far everything is just looking outstanding of no complaints jerk system is working fantastic not having to do any top offs this new version with one inch has definitely made all of the difference in the world getting rid of all that quarter-inch all my plant sites are getting the exact amount of water that I want now and the plants are just really loving the consistency of the feedings and the quantities really healthy garden right now really happy I am writing this thing at 1350 ppm still right now will probably step the co2 up to 1500 or 1450 in the next week or so when they really really start heavy budding but for now we're just going to let them get finished with the rest of their stretch I have been kind of adjusting the lights they're out there about 18 inches I would say above above the canopy and we're just gonna kind of keep it at that height in relevance to the canopy from you know as they continue to finish off their stretch I don't imagine that from here on out they'll stretch a whole lot more since they are starting to kind of sit down and develop their bud sites pretty nice I think additionally stretch you know another few inches or so so yeah that's pretty much it for this video the next video should be relatively interesting with a lot more bud development and we will be back next week to update you on the progress so till next time guys what's going on guys back with the next video update here from the room a 4000 watt blue dream grow featuring 16 blue dream plants running X nutrients and psycho additives so yeah you guys might notice that the trail set is up now in the script in this video and I just want to talk about that for a second here because one thing that I've pretty much always tried to preach to people is don't be the don't be the you know stereotype and what [ __ ] needs to get done don't put it off just get it done and your gardens will thank you for it and that's always basically been my style throughout this grow though I was kind of hesitant on putting up the the net for a little bit because I wanted to make sure that they can are stretching this planet back here [ __ ] stretch this [ __ ] ton more than the rest of these and so I wasn't sure they were so much eat up or what and since these branches were so thick I mean the stems are just ridiculously think of the top agiza I was like ah there's the thing they're good worry about it and I was planning on putting it up this Sunday and I got down here and I'm I was trying to finish my drip system and Home Depot ran out of the parts and didn't get it done I was driving all over the place trying to get you know some stuff and I was like I'll be good I'll do it on Monday when I get in and I get in yesterday and [ __ ] basically this whole front of my garden just was like laying on the floor basically these branches guys I let these plans get so pushy they eventually just pulled everything down with suicide heavy it just was making a mess you know put up the trellis man basically went in here and did a full-on volleyball session [ __ ] in there and I didn't see now step out of here there's a huge pile of brought down some huge branches too but I also lost a couple of big branches and in the process as they they came to UM Kings so far over that they snapped office then basically it was karma kicking me in the ass because I put it off so don't push it off that's the only thing that today's lesson will the plaintiff still looking good they're starting to offer back the child's name gentlemen some of these branches are still a little stunned see this guy right here he was falling over probably laying on the ground for a little while he's all over her some like these right here are I'm hoping they'll recover and I'm hoping that the net it's a promise it should provide us support checking along I don't know if I mentioned it but today is day 23 of flowering you just starting the four feet the reservoirs just topped off I've been running him out of fresh water for the last two days in the next couple days now Christel production on already pretty happy with the budget looking just pissed off that I I know what keeps me making sure I do anyway you can see that something next few weeks this garden comes so I'm just going to hit him up with the next week in nutrients and the next day or two I'm just gonna kind of flush them out like I said that's gonna let see I think I step up 1375 of the S bloom a 25 of them you know accidentally and then we're going to with a psycho evidence which is dr. hare to millions for all of these doctor repair design of tea right now we're still running the - the potash is at 300 milliliters we're also running 500 milliliters of sweet raw and it's 250 million silikal glass that's pretty much it for this video we'll be back at the next one you", "g73PDy83_PU": "The silence reminds me of when I died.

boat cool man slammer Jack all right buzz open your bail up that way you don't have to follow Steve around there you go here you go swim here and just like and just like captain Scott said just like captain Scott said uh when you catch him just what I like to do is leave oh I don't like reeling him up any more than about that right so what that'll do is that means so there's your fish right you got in the top when you lift like that he'll swing right to you another amberjack what do they call those actually they're like those are bandage runners yeah thought they were I call them a

going right in the box here we're have to catch some values here in a little bit God has a big book not have to be can't catch fish without the mate beautiful cast Stevie these nice green backs coming off the grass Everglades the green grass nice whoo you into the blue presented by yellowfin is brought to you by Yeti coolers wildly stronger keep ice longer by Simrad and the new NSS sport touchscreen display and by marine formulas stable I la mirada tail Walker charters and play no walk right on back here in the corner and I'm gonna throw it in the water there it is see it but everybody I'll use are at keep it right up on the top they're coming to get it no one's eating it let him eat that just keep your eye on it hold it up a little higher they like it right off the top oh

though these brailles aren't twisted or the netting turned it all you want to make sure it's just perfectly straight come down and get our arm length grab another arm lake about where here's your waist is and then very important to go through it all make sure the sinkers aren't tangled this is gonna be good buzz those valleys don't know what's gonna hit them captain Steve's get ready drop the bomb on them that's how you do it buzz those baits would be good for about four hours yeah may last a little on but a lot of stress on them right now you catch the pilchard a jogger sing yeah I'm gonna be got in there all right Walker give me just one second here coming beautiful casts TV these nice green backs coming off the grass Everglades computing grasp nice whoo nice cast let's go catch it snapping man all right buzzy will fly by you buddy put this up I make my living on the water but from time to time we like to travel whether it be deer hunting or just taking a family vacation I always add the stay bill to my fuel system you know for me it's only going to be a month but some of you guys are gonna be away from your boat winterizing them for four months this product ensures that when you come back to your boat to your lung or whatever it is and you hit the key it's gonna run and perform exactly the way you left it day in and day out use chartering every day ethanol treatment my marina does not have ethanol free fuel and I don't have the time to run around and find it what I do is I purchase this product a very inexpensive product add it to the fuel system day in day out and it'll help stop all the issues with ethanol fuel this product will allow you to run a better mile per gallon you'll get a better fuel burn and you will have all the residual effects of the ethanol so whether you're putting your boat up or whether your Charter and day in and day out stable has a product that will help you protect your investment kinda like this maybe you're gonna like this a lot whoa goodbye it barely hooked you into the blue presented by yellowfin is brought to you by bass pro shops your adventure starts here by Seaguar always the best fishing line and by marathon King sailfish mounts spear one charters and frabill fishing gear you don't see them back home do you buzz what do you think pretty cool not too many of them well you got white-tailed deer but you don't have porpoise those are some well-fed porpoise right no they're going to the traps you notice that are they checking them out yeah they're going right down we're just starting to cool down the ballyhoo are everywhere I mean you saw it on the patch reef mm-hmm and you know we caught some ballyhoo they're deep a tree then we shot offshore to your mutt hole oh yeah you're gonna like this baby you're gonna like this a lot whoo goodbye barely hooked there's a big old box that yeah feel it bellies he is tight tight tight tight at least 12 pounds maybe 14 feels stomach there's something inside of him your bat it's your ballyhoo yeah he's ready for the Yeti busted up that nice mutton caught a couple of Benitez caught some skipjacks we were coming in and we're like I'm like yeah check those frigate no the last hour of the day was a call bonus stuff I was having more fun feeding the jack crevalle watching you unload our live wells I couldn't take my eyes off him any bait that swim bar boat had a 15 to 25 pound Jack about chasing it until it caught it yeah and there was a million there the water was yellow and it was froth and there was frigate birds diving there was values running for their lives and there were tens of thousands of Jack or Alice's you're fighting a fish were feeding the fish and there's quite a show watch it oh my God look at a ballot box the other stud there's so many fish swimming underneath those what so far mata machine look like right now look at these big boys yeah you can hear the pitch you hear that buzz listen to the ocean and we just sit there and just watch them for a while of course we're gonna catch one we sled some bait well then just catch one one fun up we unloads are put up leftover for our live wells and that I was jacked up I was I was not anything visual is cool you know it's like those redfish just like Amy anytime you're doing a visual deal oh that's cool thing to do man I mean those go Jack our mouths are a neat animal to watch they'll wipe out your ballyhoo school like you love to go down he'll do that along I'll have to go down to like conky next week cuz they're gonna eat them all the jack crevalle the cool fish that dot and actuality that Jack of I'll beat him up harder than anything else today yeah we had done everything we could do we used every bait in the boat - Chum up for a visual show and then catch one I mean he buzz would have caught five them or he would caught them all all night long well you know yeah sometimes you got to come home you got a really sharp thing on ya know some people grab him by the tail ya gotta be real careful man see that yeah razor sharp great fish though cool well he got the pliers but from there my we had we had done everything we could do we used every bait in the boat - Chum him up for a visual show mm-hmm and then catch one I mean buzz would have caught final or he'd caught him all up all night long so you know yeah sometimes you got to come home everything just turned out perfect I think I mean it couldn't have gone better said husband did you like you like decent fish he's like hot love seafood so we got him some fish here - for him to have cooked up here at hawks cay the restaurant and he's gonna be feeding his family tonight we had a great time a lot of catching tell you what some fishing it was it turned out to be kick just catch him had the famous Scott Walker freaking turn into Yellin turn it up man hey you know what it's a days over and at the end of the day you were my deckhand today I was that was pretty spent that's pretty darn special I pulled the anchor I fine", "bmuz2FRRAps": "hello guys and welcome back to deck doctor this week we are gonna cover sin elegans dream control deck a greedy heart the playlist which will challenge you as a player so this isn't for the faint-hearted this is gonna take a lot of figuring out while your opponent student and how you're gonna respond to that and it does run a lot of legendary cards so keep that in mind so this deck is based around Aurora's dream I use cards to a cellar a turf area like storm spawn and windfall and then you are able to combo stuff off like yak attack with Aurora se and get tremendous amounts of value off that dream it's not the only way you can win our Gabrielle outcomes are very powerful and you can use Aurora's creation to copy our cons and generate a lot of six sixes on board with a lot of mobility with that charge too so it has a lot of ways it can win but the dream win condition is obviously the more fun one and can be very effective if you can pull it off like I said this deck is quite difficult to pilot I have been playing it myself and I've been hit or miss for me because sometimes I've made some mistakes other times I've played it quite well and it will take some getting used to a versus deck kind of seemed like it was a bit of a fun deck but Cinelli and actually hit rank 1 god with this deck and held it for a day so he has been used in this deck at the highest level and getting results so let's get into the deck guys and we'll start off by talking about the creatures so to start things off we have law is gonna be one of our main theory of harvesters but also gives us that card draw we need to get to those a cards like windfall and storm spawn a very valuable asset in this game card draw and especially with control decks so yeah pretty self-explanatory there collect Ferrier draw some cards Aurora is one of the one of the many legendaries in this deck is gonna turn the attack of one of our creatures into a six six and this had plenty of uses you know could turn that law thief from a warm 1/1 into a six six and make it fight on board but also has great combos of yak attack you know these yaks have haste so gonna be able to have a sticks with haste if you have enough area but also you can copy it with Aurora's creation a very powerful use of that card is to copy Aurora and be able to power up some of your smaller creatures next up is gabrielle an arc on a keycard and Annie flew control deck as there's a lot of high-cost cards in this deck and it's gonna be able to trigger into a six six or four theory with charge two very powerful start line and very powerful card in general and also has fantastic synergies with the Aurora's creation because you can make multiple six-six-six is I can zip around the board collect FIRREA and fend off any aggression and last but not least it's not exactly a creature but it does make creatures and that is yak attack summon spree - - yaks with haste these guys can collect very few so you may even get a cost reduction based on when you play them you want to be playing around wells ideally if you can and of course that interaction with Aurora is fantastic and also if they do survive after clearing a bunch of creatures you can aurora say them and make them higher cost creatures for the following turn or on the turn that they play dependent if you need a bit of board presence so let's move on to some of your barrier acceleration cars so at first we have Baron vulgar which is a six cusp or five last word both of you and your opponent draw a card and it costs zero now this may seem like a double-edged sword at first but you have so many amazing cards you can hit with this windfall for one storm spawn for another but imagine if you got Aurora's dream costing zero that is some crazy stuff right now and Aurora's dream which we'll cover a bit later on allows you to draw until you have nine cards in your hand and it all costs zero as well so some amazing value can be found from the baron storm spawn up next a four five body that has a last word that gives you ten FIRREA this is a great card to fight on board with against colors like red and green because they don't have very effective ways to remove it red it's not too bad actually you know they do have the damage based removal but green is going to straw a lot more and you can get some value maybe get some clears or some damage then on to their creatures against blue you're not gonna want to play this without I'm failed at experiment failed experiment combo with this allows you to play this card and then it dies and then you gain a free fairy advantage so keep that in mind same with kind of yellow as well I don't this to get last nightmare do you know you it if you don't wanna use it a fight on boarding it's those two colors specifically so most of the time going to be using this to fail decks we've failed experiment but against red and green you might want to use it fight on board windfall is the last of the ramp cards code the Big Daddy of ranked cards we've seen this card a lot in blue and keep in mind that windfall and storms form both activate your archons which are a key card in your early game and of course in your late game as well when you combined it with Aurora's creation to fight on board so these are gonna help you again Aurora's green quicker and once you get a Roy's dream down usually you're gonna be very far ahead because all those cards you draw are gonna cost 0 so now you have all this FIRREA what type of creatures are you gonna be something we're gonna cover some of the Big Daddies in this deck so first up we have Aurora say stick a 10 Ferrier 6 6 that transforms all your creatures on board to to cost higher so a law thief becomes a 5 cast an Archon becomes a 6 cast you get the idea to know kind of the range of creatures that you can get from a row so it's gonna take a little bit of research kind of looking a collection and see what you can get so sometimes you may need to Aurora say to make your small creatures bigger to be able to trade and stuff but having a good idea of what you can get I will help you Lew did do a chart for it for unbanned evolution when it existed but it's a bit outdated so there's definitely something we'd like to see in the future char the cover Aurora so if this deck does get popular and next up is radiant so this is one of your major combat cards and this oh man this card has amazing potential in this deck you draw a lot of cards anyway your control deck you're trying to build up to this dream but not only that radience can give you a comeback from healin it can put an aggressive 10/10 on your opponent but you can also Aurora's creation it to get another agent so heal yourself again if you get in trouble a very powerful card in this deck so keep an eye on what you can do with this Aurora's creation is a fantastic combo last up is the king himself Magnus 10 FIRREA for 8 with charge free and combat draw a card it cost zero and again I discussed how a baron fogger as I mentioned the synergies of this deck the King is exactly the same and against red and green this guy is not going to get transformed or hard removed like blue and yellow it's gonna have to be dealt with the old-fashioned way so the more hit to get him this card the better is gonna be so let's talk about some of the utility cards which I've already talked at talked about in the previous parts such as failed experiment and Aurora's creation so what first will talk about failed experiment and I've already mentioned how this card is great with storm spawn it's gonna be one of the main uses a failed experiment but keep in mind as well lower fee fits a card you could use uses this Aurora in a tight spot a low fee is good with this kind of playing it's red coz low fees are very easy to for red to remove especially green red war storm as well another use of this card as well if you if you have an Aurora's dream ready to go off and you have a couple of these in your hand it might be worth just using them so you get them out of your hands you can draw more important stuff with your roars dream so just keep that in mind when you're playing with failed experiment and next up we have frog off I so this is the premium transform effect for blue right now transform a creature into a 2/2 and it just helps you manage some of those big frets like zealous Crusaders for example and it helps you gain the board back with archons because our cons are a weight the way you're going to be keeping on board so if you need can transform I'm big and you can keep our Khan alive it's probably worth it speaking of archons a rose creation combined with Archon is very powerful just because you create very cheap six sixes with charge - which have a lot of mobility on board but you can also use this card with say storm spawn if you want extra FIRREA aurora aurora herself you know to get cheap power-ups radiance which i talked about previously is a very good combo with this card if you need some health so you can get quite creative for Rose creation try a few combinations in the right situations and see what results you get so before we wrap up all the cars let's talk about Aurora's dream so Aurora's dream brings this deck together as you can see there you draw until you have nine cards in your hand and reduce the cost of all cards in hand to zero the 24 FIRREA very pricey card but has an incredible effect against other control decks you're gonna be able to get this off quite a lot against more aggressive decks you might not be able to but this deck can still fight against those decks with all its various celebration in the Gabrielle archons and yak attacks so your primary goal is to get Aurora's creation if it's reliable you know you don't don't stop taking don't stop taking control the board to try and save up for auras creation if it's like two turns away because that might give your opponent enough time to win the game you have to kind of time it quite well and that's kind of what makes this deck so complex because a lot of the time you're gonna be reacting to how your opponent plays and sometimes that's gonna allow you to play a roars dream quite easily other times you're gonna have to just ignore it and just fight on board and win the old-fashioned way so it's gonna take some practice to get used to this day but keep at it it is very rewarding so let's talk about the Morgan next so the primary cards you want in your Mulligan are barrier collectors law thief is great half star which I've said but alternative cards are con is the same as charge too so we can get around the farrier Wells very quickly the Baron is also a great favorite collector but on the other hand when its last words go off you might be able to get that windfall or that aurora's dream on the cheap and you're gonna be in a fantastic position so these guys are all great keeps the next two cards I'm going to talk about could also be good keeps as well windfall is also a fantastic keep in this deck and if you keep windfall and also have the option to keep Magnus I definitely recommend it especially if you know your opponent are playing red or green because it can be very hard for than to remove it without getting its combat ability off so windfall is definitely a keeper in combination with a gatherer and if you can keep Magnus as well I definitely recommend it so before we move on to land placement let me talk about some of the changes you can make to this deck to help you against more aggressive decks so as I was preparing this deck dr. cianelli was still testing the deck and one of the changes he made was adding plague barons because I have such good synergies with failed experiment and can lead to massive board wipes as you can see here we have minus one baron minus one yak attack and minus one Aurora's creation but plus free play ver so if you find that your opponents are more aggressive this may be a good switch for you to help fight those aggressive creatures of low howl for use the nose failed experiments using plague Birds collectors could be quite awkward for your opponents at the aggro players because their creatures have such low health and this was a recommendation by Cinelli in himself so he has tried and tested and he and he said that this change helps against yellow quite a lot so just keep that in mind so let's talk about some long line placements for this deck all right we have a lot to cover for land placement first off I want to say straight away that you are responding to your opponent and so it's going to be taking you're going to need to play the stick quite a bit to get an idea of how you need to react to your opponent and how to do it correctly now the one thing I can say straight off the bat is a lake in the center is great because this opens at what we call the Archon o because your archons have charged to and can move around the farrier Wells very effectively so what I mean by this is if you look at these lake placements here now you don't need all of these but these are great spots for Lakes because once you summon your Archon on one of them they can double collect and they can move around the board in the oh and I'll show you an example of this oh right now so if you do have the land set up in this way you are able to move your archons freely collect FIRREA and help defend on the board your primary goal is to collect various so you can use your auras dream so against more aggressive opponents you're gonna have to build a more control style from the side of your orb whereas against a more mid-range deck you can build on the opposite side of them so if your opponent for example is going down this way you're gonna want to build your land around it so you can collect more FIRREA and then defend later on to give you more chance to get your win falls off and your storm spawns now I've played this deck quite a bit recently and I'm still figuring things out so I'm just giving you the basics with this guide it's gonna take a bit of practice but I can promise you that if all the different lines are plays you can make for this deck makes it so rewarding and I can see this becoming a popular direction for blue to go and especially with aggro not being as strong as it used to be decks can be greedier and the more greedier decks we get this is probably going to be the king of them because it has that aurora's dream so that wraps up this episode of deck doctor thank

it's Alexandra Williamson and I am talking to you on the channel the secret history living inside of your aquarium so recently I put in some algae which is just kind of a shrimp update on the population you can see we've got a wild-type it may have been a Jade shrimp or it could have been a chocolate shrimp that just kind of reverted I don't know that it's fully neo caridina I think it may have something else in it I don't know how they interbreed but it is a big big guy or girl should I say there are also brand new shrimp that were born last night clearly you can see them there they're about the size of a shrimps I almost and then there's the blue one there that was born within the week and you can see some really teeny ones up in here that have no color yet and then there's the one that was born two or three weeks ago right here so in this in this little frame right now we've got every stage of development pretty much from the shrimp adult that is our shrimp juvenile that is not quite ready to have it its young yet - the shrimp blitz which are only going to be filter feeding and then the the intermediate size where they start to show what their colors gonna be now we've got the albino ram's horn snails here we've got the pond snails here I put in some crab food like specifically for crabs and they seem to like that I hadn't fed them in a couple days they'd just been eating algae and fish food that was left over in the tank from a while back but this is a great way don't feed them for a couple days and then give them food and they'll all come to the wherever you put the food and if you establish a spot where that food is then you can kind of get a quell and I was gonna try to count the babies but I see one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve there's over 30 right in this area on this rock but they're just hard to see but it's a good way to do it also you can see if you missed any calls so this one this striped shrimp will probably be called out although I do really like its patterns it's just it's gonna throw the line off and we'll have some funky shrimp this is a blue shrimp this dark black one actually in it is let's see if she's still pregnant yes she is still pregnant this other blue shrimp which is a true blue dream not a blue velvet but a blue tree she's clearly like ready to have babies any second now so that's also good news I don't see a single shrimp elsewhere in the tank out other than right here so yeah I don't think I do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 okay so we've got like 16 shrimp in the tank right now which is a good number and you can see how much red are these shrimp are getting now that we've gotten we sold the Cole shrimp at to the local fish store and then we've been keeping the lesser grade shrimp separate and there's gonna be some mixing going on but right now we've got females the two blue females have only been with blue males before they were bearing eggs so as soon as they are not carrying eggs anymore they will go back up into this tank with the other blue dreams and blue Velvets I have decided to start mixing those strains because people know where they can get blue dreams and blue velvet strains online but I want to make cut of my own strain with some different traits and so we'll be doing that in the future but I just wanted to show you some really healthy shrimp these ones are doing great we've also got a soul tangerine in this Tay and we need to get some mates for for her yeah for her and we'll see how that goes we've also got back here now I'm seeing a almost translucent shrimp which is definitely not one I want in the population they color up with age a little bit as you'll see but once they reach about a quarter of an inch they don't get a ton they don't change their pattern a ton and so you can kind of tell what you want to pull out of the population but you know caridina shrimp are great for raising in a community tank as long as you're diligent and can definitely make sure there's not even one male in the tank that is not what you want and so as long as you're keeping track like like I have been I can keep track of the fact that there are only two blue females in here so I need to get them both out keep checking on them and then I also need to start culturing more in this tank and getting different different micro fauna and flora living in the tank so just an update right here we've got the ideal that the fire painted red you'd probably call that shrimp there this one's getting ready to molt but she is also a very strong colored shrimp the Blues are so blue that they're black and we've talked about that and then the albino ram's horn we've got one that's not quite as good and then we've got one that is the ideal that I'd like to see in this tank this tank also we're gonna start growing sea monkeys as they're known but brine shrimp if you want the official wording and also probably some more copepods and things because I need to feed by my other fish with those because we're gonna be breeding some new fish on the channel so you see you couldn't even tell that she was pregnant until she just swam upside down so I'm really excited to see her babies as I said it takes them six months to reach maturity so you have time to pull them out of the tank and you know by three months or so exactly what they're gonna look like and my local pet shop has no problem selling even like the lightest colored shrimp some people want them just as a natural kind of look like something like this or even the brown ones so I let them hang out in the tank but it's I just have to be very diligent on pulling out the calls as I go whereas this would hopefully she'll breed true she's only been with Sakura fires and she will go back being that her and him on the left there those two are the only Sakura's in the tank at this time and it's fine if he impregnates other females so it's fine if if good shrimp mate with lesser quality shrimp the males but it's not okay if the women are lesser quality and the men are lesser quality because you're just gonna go downhill and dilute the gene pool whereas I'm fine with working upwards with a nice male in the tank and then just to make sure to get those colors out so you really got to get rid of the blues before it's too late so to speak and also I thought it was kind of interesting you know you think of snails as these slow things but some of these snails actually move really quickly and do some funky weird stuff but yeah so there's the sakura male or female I should say you can't tell this occurs Sakura painted fires are pregnant unless you see their undercarriage and the males that's about as red as they'll get usually you can still see a little bit of ribbing on him but he's not completely like blood-red all the way through so the goal is to have more shrimp like her the one up top there and hopefully if he keeps mating with these ones will it will get that outcome closer and closer but just need to stay on top of the calling so that's the update from the shrimp tank here the shrimp tank up here we've got the tiger end lers or leopard end lers we've got some Cory cats and their shrimp in here somewhere there's rainbow fish neon rainbow fish in here now - hopefully we can get them breeding and the end lers will keep breeding we looks like we have a pregnant female endler right up front here and then this is now a shrimp tank also in that we've got the electric blues in here which are the blue dream and the blue velvet cross and if you look at my old video on shrimp genetics you'll know that blue dream in blue velvet even though they looked the same often they are from different lines of genetic morphing and so I think it'll make a stronger shrimp and I actually like the brighter blue some of that has to do with the substrate they're living on but I like that brighter blue so in the upcoming videos we're gonna be talking about some of what's dominant versus what's recessive we're gonna be talking about these Australian rainbow fish we're gonna be discussing the tank and the history of these rainbow fish and why people don't keep them very often because they think they're not that colorful but they're full of personality and they do get colorful as they spawn or as they become adults and this tank has really settled in with you know everybody's looking healthy and happy so I'm glad that this one's up and running now this is one that I'm having a debate about because she only stands to gain from the strong blue shrimp in this in this tank but she is technically a a inferior blue jelly and I don't know if she should stay in this tank if I put her in the other tank she'll be diluted ideally I should probably just get rid of her but yeah so she's kind of like oh she almost looks like a Pinto caridina but she's definitely neo caridina and she could maybe produce offspring that are inferior but they still have this blue color that I want so it's kind of like do I let them be with the dark blues or do I ain't come out and just let them be whatever as you can see the rainbow fish are ripping up my landscape so I need to rearrange some plants and pick some different things I think we're gonna go with all Australian and Papua New Guinean plants so we'll be doing more plant profiles will be talking mating and genetics and then we're gonna talk about the history of these species coming up as well and also how weather climate and some of the climate change has been impacting some of these fish it's kind of interesting what they've gone through and what some of the things are built in into their genetics for them to survive so I hope that you're enjoying this process watching our little shrimp family grow and you know now I've been I've made 150 dollars in a month off of these shrimp and I've bought more fish than I'm hopefully gonna raise and make money to keep up the hobby of basically you just keep selling and ask for store credit rather than the cash they're gonna give you way less cash so I've got 150 in store credit then you get you know start at your different stores you start buying expensive fish and that are easier to mate or get breeding and then those sell those for cash down the road so you're really kind of a three-tiered process to make money off of the breeding rather than that instant gratification of making fifteen to forty bucks here and there with you know your cold shrimp so I thought upon further inspection I have no idea what kind of shrimp that is it was probably blue where I wouldn't have put it in the tank but that is an oddball shrimp and I don't know where she came from but she's gonna go into the mixed tank because she may produce some weird offspring or some natural offspring and there is a also a big market for that in Seattle so if you like this if you're learning anything if you've enjoyed the channel the shrimp stuff or the crib

strain of you on the blue dream so without much further ado let's just get right into it here's some dope shots of the nugs we can get to smoke in this joint so blue Dreams is sativa dominant hybrid coming out of California and it's definitely one of those like legendary West Coast strains everybody's heard of it essentially the genetics are a blueberry plant with a Hays plant and it really gives you like a full kind of relaxed feeling and not too heavy the smokes a little harsh not as smooth as some of the other leaves up reviewed but it's got a real good taste to it just the right amount of bite and the taste on the exhale is actually quite excellent it tastes a lot more like the blueberry plant smell definitely reflects the haze plant this meat is one for you guys out there who don't like those mind rape indicas you know who you are this is gonna be a good potent strain if you're into the sativa is you but it's gonna be an active high you're gonna be able to go around and do [ __ ] after this variety that I picked up is definitely one of the more indica heavy phenotypes just from the way that the buds are grown into sort of like a thick sticky column so the flavor profile on this weed is very very heavy and tastes and smells very sweet even once it's lit doesn't really have that cush smell that a lot of people find mandatory in their weed but personally I find it to be quite quite a nice break from the constant indica you know purple death bucker or whatever the hell you know these crazy strains are called essentially this weed is is it's a good daytime smoke I say that a lot about various weeds and I think this one really sets the bar at a new level because the blue dream is a an especially tasty smoke that's not gonna get you fry mind you I am still feeling pretty good off of this little joint I feel very settled in calm relaxed happy yeah I mean the blue dream itself the weed is great the flower is just there just perfect but another great thing about this weed is the way that it looks while it's growing it's actually a beautiful beautiful plant so if you are gonna grow some blue dream you should know that it tends to grow pretty tall and it tends to have a pretty high yield although it's a moderately difficult strain to grow because I believe it's kind of susceptible to lots of pests and things plus it stretches while it's flowering so there's a couple of things you should know before you go and try to grow the blue dream but if you do get a chance to smoke the blue dream I highly recommend it you should definitely pick up a big bag if you can anyways I think that's it for me on the stringer view of the Blue Dream thanks for watching guys don't forget to like if you like what you see comment if you have something to say send it to your friends share it on your Facebook each of vegetables all that good [ __ ] and and yeah peace out guys thanks for watching", "dtVRR6nTDD0": "what up to my left is Brewer here I just wanted to give you

rid of the flickering watch what happens it's almost like there's just not enough light so that is bright but I suppose it's better to look at this than flickering as now the latent level is already probably pretty low that the light level is like only five watts above this time my god they're gone quickly where they do at the meeting hey what the hell what's happening there did you see that that was Live Meeting on camera I'm just gonna see what that was there because it don't look like that one attacked it look what's happening is it trying to more maybe it is being mated with me seven look you guys want to show us to your practice no I was strange that may have been meeting but the female didn't look like you see the girl they're coming back across that was pretty cool to see this is probably acceptable isn't it guys it's acceptable to Luca look at that lovely girl right in the middle the big buried mama hello creepy shrimpers would you take also should have a built-in they do but it actually doesn't do anything I know what you mean there's actually a thing you're paralleling frequency on a flicker let me try another sin looks exactly the same is to do with it with the exposure risk to law that flickers more this is acceptable I think maybe we could zoom Anna Todd maybe that is it assume then let's focus on my god I fixed it I didn't do the wrong stuff today oh that's probably as good as it's gonna get my vision is so bad I'm just gonna go by this snail the snail looks okay doesn't it let me see snail where are you yeah let's go by just listening I'm gonna focus in this Neil alright so if I need to adjust after this we will hello guys hello all the new people that I haven't mentioned yet hello kia how you doing yeah I don't know what is with blue shrimp but they're very hard to take pictures of it's almost like the camera can't see them almost like that I mean I you guys um I can't remember if I should you me calling these shrimp gear that's how far I'm behind in the video making I actually have made a video of me calling this shrimp I don't think I have I shown it yet or was that live on camera my memory is so good hello Tim by the way hello Dave are we doing sir Dave from I says hello here comes the snail this is a sea snail best one the snail is huge it's beautiful isn't it these guys have really nice little babies as well Andy Ashley how you doing oh that's a nice cup of coffee so hope you don't have a nice day so far so here's quite interesting right what I've noticed with these blue jeans so far as most of them seemed like - they seem to be very blackish you know like I'm not sure if there's a block sakura house a little bit of blue in them as well hello tears how you doing Ian welcome to the stream hello shrimp nerd says tear salad hello tear salad shrimp nerd arse pixie fast breeders I would say no because I haven't had any breed since I had them and I've had them for like 10 months but then all of a sudden they're breathing even in this tank there's like three or four clutches of eggs which are gonna be hello Tim new fishes with my shrimp Daisy race what were you talking about are you talking about chubby Farzad hello sir anyone have an idea what makes a shrimp a blue dream versus a blue velvet it's just the difference in color I know you want to know specifically but without actually showing you it's gonna be hard to describe I think they're they're not liable later live over I don't know hello Benny welcome to the stream hello where myself be myself ii am i blue dream cross velvet through it block blue on chocolate colors if some of these some of these they look very black it's nice to see some of the babies coming forward as well though guys i have to ask you as well have i shown you the culling video for this as I called this tank I think it was like a week ago two weeks ago but I can't remember ever put the video on YouTube or not hello ah let's welcome to the stream so you guys can see here a what the dime I have with blue dreams is which one is actually the blue dream as if the one on top of the snail there's kind of like a light blue or is it the ones that are almost black I don't know I'm not that good with their greetings your Joe had a long hey maka how blue dreams myself but the gift black color or gif I was reading as I'd like gift they give black colors for me too what do you do have to do with the black ones I don't know there is palm I don't know I haven't seen her hello Tim I've not seen the culling video okay maybe I haven't shown you guys a yet it's amazing hasn't I don't really know the difference isn't report is a blue achievement what's not but I'm going for the bluest blue stop the blue under incest was the difference between us pixie snail and a Malaysian trumpet snail in this picture you can see the difference indeed that one in the middle is a sea snail and the small ones at the far right hand side on the bark on that piece of clay those are Malaysian trumpet snails no doubt we'll see some Malaysian trumpet snails on this as well part that says do I have green cheese no I will get them this year though earlier Jess says I'm a crimp thanks I think in December more neutral color they would be easier to see the sound is a bit darker so would work better for you yeah probably probably but I think with this is better for viewing booked for breeding and selling on I think the light is slightly better because I can see everything in the shrimp itself I'm not relying on the you know the substrate or the the background to hide details hello palm welcome to the stream they are still harassing the female at the park I've noticed actually let's get to see quite a few them coming forward I did plan a second tank just in case these guys didn't sure which often happens having way much who how can I send you my car Adina shrimp clips as far as that Farzad my email address is in my About section on YouTube have a look clearly because you can see how you can send it or you can upload it to YouTube itself unlisted and I'll have a look from there Wayne who got the wine mister why he's talking about wine are you talking about webcam Roy says mark do you use a TC 420 LED controller no I don't I don't I don't even know for that it's talking about LED controllers I'm gonna upgrade all my lights soon soon ish especially in that Rock of the bark has been neglected for years right on you know what it is guys I'm tired of buying cheap lights that don't last and then in the end I've had this room for like five or six years the amount of spent on cheap crap lights I could have had good lights that would still be working today I hope father says I hope you helped me about them yes of course of course Shelly's drinking the wine I think some of my believes almost have a back line there because these are neo Cardenas so they can't have back lines as well the mom shrimp is gorgeous which mom sure there was the video where I showed you guys these shrimp and the very beginning remember I said oh this one is buried it's actually the shrimp in the middle of the picture of the big female with a big black patch in her bark that was that shrimp I remember her because she looks quite different from the other ones you plan on getting three tanks for the blue dreams cool air living got the wine Alice's cooking I'm getting a 375 there tongue should I split into three or should I have one huge chunk timber I advise you I'd probably split it but it's up just your personal choice I would split it up flooville no I'm not sure yet but the lakes have to be reasonably long because I'm gonna put them on this rock here so I need lights at least 1.2 1.5 metres long hello Daniel and no I don't think I'm ever gonna buy any flooville product again because I still have a here up there that they have not replaced and because when I when that here broke I went beyond the person that sold me because they were just answering emails and I went to flooville themselves and they still haven't refunded me the money so they're not getting any time on my channel there wasn't min difference between part minister up and the standard sponge peddler the sponge filter for shrimp tanks part money is more powerful more powerful Daniel let me see I'll bring right there let me see you yo yo Joe I bought one time how often they change war this one actually got water change today so this one will not get another water change for a week or two 10% every week or two isolated Shelly says I'm going to send your link to lace I use be they've been good for me for over a year so or killing you know people have been telling me to look up might calm my knee calm may come or something like um lays over the cause I red to orange subtleness on the head of my blue dream news but that same Oh blue red to orange in the saddle that is very unusual actually if the fish is not sick is quite unusual fish dreams never seen that before flew all that are expensive ciske hello Dennis welcome to the stream yeah it was it was there gonna land Tom I've emailed him like four times a bit this broken here right and and guys it's not like the heater was cheap there's like for me it was like sixty dollars at least including shipping for a tiny little here right and I've told them they gave me electric shock nothing at all but from them nothing I am I even contacted fluval in the UK on Germany both their support lines guess what which one replied none of them flew var1 Facebook said wait who did I who did I email and that was it that's the only reply over hard bark flipper will not warn the warden honor honor the warranty yet only brick-and-mortar stores no internet sales honored the years of crap I should have looked at the Amazon reviews before I bother here yes good morning Dennis Dennis Sam what was that you had Dennis with Garnell and Tommy had a problem as well you bought on our reverse osmosis unit from him wasn't it as something was faulty on and he wouldn't replace it either my crew lights that was it thank you key they cruise all right there's quite a few people have said to me try night crew because they're cheaper and they're reasonably good so good morning Jackie Jones ever stop shrimp how you doing when I like and then I let Ghanian Tom on like for inspiration on YouTube years ago I used to watch all of these stuff but come on when you're selling stuff you have to reply to your emails and you Dennis you're saying he got quite rude I can see on if anybody wants to see anything go and Trustpilot and google it for yourself and see the way people talk to each other yeah I'm totally converted to Amazon by the way as well for buying stuff EP is long gone from me tired of waiting like what seems like forever with eBay for stuff I just got an ikea market it's ok just not very powerful no don't tell me that it's not very powerful I don't need it to be super powerful but I need it better than what is here augustin Tom message retracted are you seeing cable in the bottom of my tanks I cannot break then I've been meaning to get another heater for this tank as a backup equipment forgettable so that will be the plan I hadn't set my heart on my crew he lazy a I may actually contact them and see what they say first see if they will the world like doing a deal of of the send me some of their stuff I'll like promote them or something you got a try Malacca never know until you ask tim says i just bolt purchase lace from china to two dollars a foot super brave well kind of late so they temp aqua l seem to have some nice lights to aqua l i I don't think they do Europe though do they well no aqua l they they do don't they I'm thinking of aqueon now that may be an option as well but the aqua L ones for the length I need will be quite expensive here Norway like 250 $300 for one Langley that's a lot of money then it says just get here silhouette room there that would fix it right now and what can you imagine me trying this stream from a heat silhouette room Oh aqua larf what are you talking about speak English if you're trying to insult me I will burn your ass you want me to speak Spanish okay I have a high TDS I wonder if that's why my shrimp never last long hey Ronda it could be many things you're more than welcome to ask here if you have issues with your tanks where we need more information than than what you've told us it's a good light though for the money I see you swing me back a game quarter hello and welcome to the stream they are super blue no I don't want super blue I just want deal a deal a stuff and that's it wait you don't use Amazon yes I use obviously I don't I'm going towards Armas and over EB know I have Phenix on aqua knee stays fresh streams you think the lace are not the 90 ones I'm not as bright as my current blades that could be an issue because my current lace apart from this one's decent this is aqua l like the one in the bottoms decent aqua well that's about it so I'm in the hunt for decent light so many you guys have recommendations for ones that are 1.2 to 1.5 meters long not so expensive but good that would be fantastic because this this one that you're looking at here it looks super bright doesn't it but it's not it's like barely ten watts or something Martian tongues could you make your own lights from LED strips I have tried everything okay I've done all the lights you can imagine and eventually they all feel I'm gonna I'm getting a little bit sick of replacing stuff constantly Chizu relates the only thing with them is I found the one I have up here is extremely hot it's very hot creation process I really like my night crew lights they are more powerful enough barely glascott to hear actually how do I agree my blue dreams I'm going for the deepest blue blue this is a very new colony though so it will be a long time before we get them the way we want at least we have blue Neela's now some of them are very mottled though look at like you can see one of the young ones at the front there on the right hand side okay look how messy it looks your horse says mark use a deep breathe in reality they're 15 dollars each and built to resist war you can get that add fault building store you Joe email me the details please if you don't mind and he actually says I run my crew lights on they're not they're a lot brighter than the old chief place that's good to know as well actually because the the I was thinking about going back to cheap lights because the Cheaper by the word they were never very bright I have the night crew are slightly brighter the name that will do me skychi let's say is do shrimp need lots of plants or kind of use rocks recover it's entirely up to you actually I prefer rocks over plants that's just a personal choice to zero a series is the best light for your dollar mmm did sell them in 1.2 to 1.5 the only thing about me buying cheese or array is even if I buy them cheap from China half the cost I will have to pee again and customs fees but I'm Benny what did you say I missed it can see the big thing it's gone I have RGB series can't tweak the RGB color though yes you know because I'm I just want guys I'm tired of the DIY stuff a little bit tired of it because it is most my I mean I have in here like a billion plugs I want to try and cut down on my plugs as well and usually one big light that's meant for the job kind of thing wait did I just see a seat shrimp there I think I just saw a sea trip and that tank will fly past I don't really have sea trim but that one was looked quite big Jessie's tank and stuff hello Brahma common Jessie how you doing by the way guys feel worried yesterday I was swimming on my gaming string the task o 0 3 1 0 just subscribe welcome to jump from the Cusco we were yesterday I was playing battlefield bye you know what would be good though right I said I've seen that too the guys they were there I had like 10 viewed or something as if we had some kinda game we could play like multiplayer altogether out because I don't mean like Minecraft got kicked the flu's but JC is kicking the police but Amazon Prime have the best customer service for me a return to furry head pumpin didn't give me a year yeah I'm really diggin Amazon as for the customer service and stuff I don't know what it is guys right is when I buy some stuff from Amazon it seems to be processed so fast no I know and Britain the yellow bit of a hard time with the way they treat this stuff and stuff but I can't fault the service that is for sure we are shrimpers not gamers mark lay low l they have a key a lot of people like to hang out after the shrimp stuff as well and when I go in discord I don't normally sit there for hours just speaking of a shrimp I'll test my levels and get back to ughh better run it up be cool by the way guys how is the delay today because I had the wrong setting in hip hop on their YouTube before right so we're gonna do a test and I'm gonna put my arms up and start to count that doesn't work it worked yesterday another stream oh I have to see myself that it's all in thing so we're gonna do that I want to see what the dilly is boom work lights I haven't no Daniel I sing your tongues break before you use anything to prepare voice there is the your goal far is that I don't do anything to these bricks because these ones were new but they've been aged it's safe for ages so they have like I'll gain stuff on them do I do anything to prepare them no they're just clay fired clean that's it the their use in a shrimp tank is biofilm hiding sports I've had a lot of success with them so that's why I use them let me see I just want to I'm just going to check the delay guys quick Chris when I checked it the other day it was long there's like 3040 seconds and I just need a visual thing it will won't impact on on you guys where you see right so I'm just gonna do a basic test but I need to see my own stream to do it and it might look stupid so please why is YouTube studio not loading let's go dashboard I have to try and find my own live stream amazing I saw the I know there was a few of you guys a little bit upset in the last stream because it is seemed like I wasn't answering your questions and it was it was mostly due to the massive delay blue stream live let's go but it takes me this long just to get to my own video and I have a very another play alright so I'm gonna skip that and this is the test that I'm gonna count guys I'm gonna put my arms up because I'll see on my stream right and that's how I'll tell you how long the delay is right so one two three four five six seven eight oh wow seven seconds that's much better than it was before much much better seven seconds that is not bad actually so wow there you go it's kind of fixed seven seconds is still not optimal bias much better than it was crop Allah hello how are you doing sir welcome to the stream hello Jerry whatever the 67 gave it like I would appreciate that a lot by the way if you're watching please like subscribe do all that crap glass gone hands down my little guys love it I only feed my guys glass got a merchant with it all Thank You Jesse hello sent out America do you suggest glass garden soil mark for car ignition everybody's telling me to use it so it must be good I think was over a minute before yes it was a simple fix corazon or coarser you weren't there I think it was Jerry that was there actually I had this the channel set up so I don't know what's called you know what the YouTube does I think called transcoding you can say so the delay is longer when you when you're live streaming so that the transcoding is faster after the stream does that make sense but never gonna set up so that there's minimal latency so I can interact with you guys a bit better than before taco balls hello so now you can be mad from in answering yes in dark or Scogin no Finn dark pavia Alice no it was me what Jillian said oh my god cursor chorus that I can't remember anything arm Smith says is in the middle of making a bamboo hide because he wants to hide in the bamboo you know that's what I was looking at today today the heart for sale outside a shop called plantation today a bamboo who should type thing when I know there's many different types of bamboo bush but this this one was all at Missy it was very thick there's a bit of meter high in the leaves were like this I thought I wonder if I could use up my shrimp tanks I wonder if I could use that mushroom times because it was on discount as well it was something like a hundred crooners which is like 10 bucks 10 10 bucks America 10 bucks us or that's like $100 Canadian right but the thing is is I don't know if bamboo can live it's 8 here in Norway I'm not sure if I want to have it in the shrimp room maybe he about made a good spot right there a little bamboo thing and he leaves it fall off just Chuck into the shrimp tanks hello Don welcome to the stream not NOLA Jean how are you doing gonna get my coffee be right back oh I don't have anything else I'm Marcus the reason why you don't use lids and your tanks um I have reverse osmosis war here on top almost died so I never really have to worry about evaporation because I just top up again once or twice a week Andres Escobar how he doing he doesn't have a car you guys with cars is that an issue like it's okay you sound substrate for news I'm getting some beautiful green jade shrimp certainly what make sure they will thrive what do you suggest the blue dreams that you see on this camera are are actually on sand j-bolts I like sand an attack acaba says I killed my crystal shrimp I had two nights ago all on the shrimp I'm not giving up on them I will wash Marc till I learn how to keep them aqua bulbs if you need more help with something feel free to ask Sam an Emmy on just like give me all your details everything that you do for a bomb snail I'm surprised you know I'm looking over here the tank with snow there's over there I'm surprised there's not more of these shrimp on here because I knew was going to put these guys on camera today and they're not all over the food they didn't get food yesterday either but we have a backup tank lined up the triangle I don't know what do you think guys - nine o'clock today maybe nine o'clock which is about an hour and 20 minutes right so we'll give these guys another twenty minutes and then we'll switch turn of the tongue yeah you tell us what happened aqua balls will help you with the Sun is my favorite son is one of my favorite substitutes a because when you watch the shrimp ray when you watch them feeding the lid like this they will grab the Sun and throw it to the sides and it looks like it's like it's meant for them to hold them there little claspers hello Nadia how are you doing you're going swimming so you're gonna miss the stream please Nadia a shrimp like our Tamiya how often should I feed them mark I'm honestly it's up to you how much roll de Hollis should get a baby that's kinda that's kind of an appropriate language there let me see where's my face masks well you guys are new to the stream every sophomore pop up face masks on Tomica giggle to make you wet your pants Nadia says I don't know what time this finishes but I'll be back in just over an hour and we should still be streaming in an hour I think neither what's the worst that can happen when getting a baby says Jerry Oh your bank balance that's one of the things it seems to like constantly be drained I shouldn't go crazy for frozen out Tamina - I've never tried actually never tried it miss you already marked em Thanks all thank you Nadia I think alice is Alice never wants to have kids Jerry and Benny are offering to help you make a kid is that what you're saying oh god here it goes with this microsiemens stuff again once the hormones kick in cores are pissing myself fluffy yeah I've actually tried blood warm quite a few times actually have some in the freezer I keep on forgetting to use it you know to use it up but these guys are doing quite well you can see the parameters I have them and and they're my new primers you've seen that a few times I just changed the name of the little label there to blue dreamy or caridina g6 KH 4 TDs 190 temperature of 23 degrees ish because my room temperature is roughly the same oh please broke my own neck there is actually 23 degrees in here I have a little fun in the back here the circulates air so it's like a fun assistive oven helps keep the tanks perfect temperature you know what's the best thing as well as I actually don't have to do anything to get it to steal like this I don't have an extra heating on there's no extra cooling it just is what it is on its own so banana bread says call me pause yes of course mark I put my pants no don't tell me this stuff god damn you we're by parents your mother dear mole says is be pullin a good to fit champ what do you recommend bee pollen is fantastic the future bee pollen even for us is considered a superfood right so here nor we what time it'll be the spring ish time is it the spring or is it slightly into the summer Barbara grubbing we see like rafts of pollen on the lakes here and under all the pollen you see billions of fish run crazy so pollen is is a really good food I actually sailor as well my store and it's and it is so good as well pond because it can last for hundreds of years mark our blue babies less harder than the rest and newest Nico I honestly don't know to be honest cherry babies are super hardly like like nuclear proof arcs almost you know you always hear the saying where they say after a nuclear war there will be cockroaches everywhere will in the war there will be cherish them for sure I think I actually have some color granules somewhere but I don't know if I've ever fed them to anything touch colored granules are I don't know what was saying there that is some equilibrium to the shrimp tank matter is the GH the ones I got a week ago is good only one survived from the four I got two nights let me read again I need some equilibrium to the shrimp tank marked or is it yes right there's there's your first mistake if you added equilibrium directly to the tank it could be a problem for the shrimp shrimp don't like that you have to mix all your war outside of the tank and then put it back in you dig see but that probably isn't enough to kill all your simpler but it will push them over the edge have you feed bee pollen it's trim you get worse [Music] [Music] Thomas Glaser thank you very much Thomas says peace Thank You Thomas you'll appreciate further said maybe you've raised I have no idea of what you're even talking about there Farzin thank you for that Thomas many of you want more kiss ash your girlfriend not running women online all that's the ultimate down ray there Oh Jessie says I just forgot to tell everyone I got my puppy that's gonna be my service dog we're so excited walking the dog is igc Alice says she misses Lucy Lucy is adorable I bought her another little jacket today I have to get a picture of it for the next ring a little jacket second a little airplane bomber tape jockey you guys know what a bomber jacket is with a white fuzzy collar it's a white fleece like wool lines right and I know a lot of people don't put coats on dogs right but in the winter here in LA we can guess like call this minus 20 every day and Lucy is a little on door gray so her first not really designed to keep in the heat so we have to keep her warm Laney says it's very random I want to see the puppy me too I want to see it yeah maybe you guys are interested in talking on this cord I will be there after the stream as well for a little while I don't know if it's going to be about shrimp oh that's the only thing see Jessie's tank says love Australian Shepherd Australian Shepherd what kind of dog is done Chilean Shepherd Australia I thought the ones that have their different colored eyes feeling shiver or my thinking Akalis that is a collie type though Jim Walt says his manga Pele beautiful shrimp I'm curious about that itself is probably good but the peel I'm not so sure about if you live in a country will you pick it yourself yes I would imagine it might be okay but google it see whether there's any insecticide properties in the peel probably isn't the double-check aquarium Corp hello we argue the real aquarium cook fish topic we're hiding as well hello fish topic are we doing sir nice to see a familiar faces today miss tropic or so is that type of dog yeah they look super cute we love you too bro hello sir huh nineteen opens crack uncle heterochromia different coloured eyes is most well known in Huskies but several briefs hover looks really cool isn't it face tropic hello brewski WF studios hello sir yeah you pull on this cord and then you guys want to see pictures go and discard we have a gallery there as well it's very those dogs are gorgeous I love their eyes I think four slash shrivel denier you see it the way it's didn't like some kinda yoga sir see it's gonna be so I think what we'll do guys is will switch tank we're going to go to the blue really tank I think even Alice Eve Hobbit Alice has it google her on my timer 0 shrimp died filled go stuck oh my god Matthew that was awful hair that is awful sucks when things like that happen I think we're going to change the shrimp you think you're gonna bring the little thingamajig over here I can sit back and relax you can watch my butt for a little coil yeah that's awful to hear Matthew hopefully you can get some more relatively easily let me see right we're gonna swap this the shrimp kama think how'd you do this I just pick up the camera I suppose let me see yeah they're all over the place I'm gonna pick the car up guys just to show you them you see a lot of them up here I don't think it's gonna be in focus but just to give you an idea of how many are still hanging around you see them up in the filter very nice let's get you guys over here without me tripping up on the cable I'll have to fix that cable look it's not too bad a picture actually is your eyes guys you need to like wipe your eyes right so we're gonna go for this little section during here you see or maybe I should put it on the food because the camera does have an issue on the leave I meant to see the camera does have a slight issue with white you guys have seen that already let's lawyer then I will put some food on this lever I think let's get much closer though there is that glare though just let me see if that is that something I can get rid of no I think it's out to the actual tripod you can go doing a little better that'll be perfect to think and I'll put some pellets in and then we can adjust the focus and stuff but we need to put two parallelism because this one has a lot of snails in as well we could to see some of the sales so they're awkward to get into this one hey let's see there you go is that okay there and that will do that will Jamie we'll just see how this goes here if I need to adjust the camera it's very hard to see though I don't know if we should get a wee bit closer maybe not right once more the shrimp come avail to fix the focus a little bit I'd have fed this tank either yesterday or today race so these guys should come to this video what 19 are you 19 Alice is asking because that's what she does you heard it here first wait for your eyes have you kind of seen their wipe your eyes if the video vision is a bit blurry so this is a wee bit blurry let's fix it let's fix it maybe zoom in on Lopez well the puppy is officially on this court I'll have a look after the stream very cool this is annoying right this camera resets itself every time I do something focus see it's like they're crawling out of the woodwork there so to speak see maybe we should see men or as it is that is ending yes it's kind of awkward I don't think I can actually get the camera in a closer on the syrup you think this will do for today guys you think I'm not so ashamed because I have a tank underneath which is the the leg on the thing is maybe we can angle it let me see you know there's issues with glir and everything on this hmm maybe I should have moved it now I think that's as good as it's gonna get today I don't have a way to set this up in a bear I clean my reading glasses well it worked I'm I am ease are you amazed I think there's another way I can do this actually let me just check guys because I can move the picture you can see here this is kinda cheating but we make bill together we're doing it this week let's try this cuz I can kind of fix the focus oh yes no you're talking no you're talking for the tiny living creatures these are called shrimp now when that light is behind us so hard for me to see the focus I don't know what it is it's just really hard for me to fix this one it looks slightly blurry doesn't it guys that's a bit as good as it's gonna get from today I think so these are the blue really that the tank where I almost out sold myself sold them into extinction you wanna check on the blue balls so these these guys are like one of my favorite shrimp on these the actual need cold as well they're meant to be blue release but the the blue blue release from scratch I mean it's changed stream level not that one I have so many stream labels another note [Music] let me see blue really New York ardena solar all of us needed to change mark have you ever thought by changing a camera with the GoPro I'm not sure of you serious yes they are I talked about this other day industry I need to get a USB dongle attachment for to get a go for to work as a as a web camera I think I'm going to go with the DSLR actually have a DSLR my wife does so I probably could use that but that that will be in the future I'll be in a future it'll be interesting to see how many shrimp come out here because I did almost sell these completely out of like no more shrimp I wish you'd just little overbearing me just check some things here now these are blue really these ones key so what do you call a red really with the blueish middle if it has blue now actually I blue really even if it has red and now side is still a blue really these these actually have read these are red like they look like bread penny fire rates with parts missing from them come with your printer shrimp says gee Ceaser this is Aquatics over there you go these aren't dark blue these are red these are red shrimp I know the loop dark blue but they're actually red red red red the red on a siding and blue and on the bellies blue in the flesh this tank is in a different light so we can probably fix one of the Layton sentence here see that's a little bit bare really means absence of color between the head and the tail yes but these guys are once I've bred myself as well so they're not perfect really not yet anyway that that is by far the best it's going to be today right so I'm going to stop messing around with it they probably grew under differently what does [Music] hi mark can you recommend recommend my shrimp that will live side by side with Guppies tetras and baby could be Fri thank you very much Joan Amano shrimp are perfect to live with the smaller fish a mono because they will eat the fish no they won't eat the fish they probably will eat fish if they're hungry enough he says that my trim tanks that explains a lot which so would mine be classed as carbon release because they don't have any red in and I always thought the carbon came from the actual pattern have you a v8 see what carbon spray looks like I think that's what it means on shrimp doesn't it doesn't having these two guys doing slowly but surely they're coming barking scheme I can see some of the females here are buried again there's like one or two them bear with eggs quite a few them subtle too I have a lot of variants of them yes yeah this one is is work in progress for sure chances thank you very much low are these blue jellies or blue dreams these are blue really some of them you can call blue jelly like the one top rate is probably getting on to be a blue jelly that's so close that the greeting is one Nate and tedious a good to know yes sorry but I came to like bloody glare and their sister the camera can't get any closer to the glass smell Aquatics hello sir Ray Bans hello and I have it on top char all that time again it's only taking me an hour to notice I'm on the wrong chart so now I will see you guys speaking and real tank you have the information on the screen there have updated even though like the listing on the video will still say something different so I actually have assassin snails in this tank as well because at this time because I feed it so much it gets overrun with snails a little bit so it's good to harbor sauce and snails in here just to keep the snail pop population down a little bit Missy are they then now they're coming back our G guys can also see I've also added a brick to this time just for more surface area more biofilm bite because you guys will know biofilm biofilm fire film means more shrimp so there you go don't they look cool when they have the yellow part in the bark subtle Ronny bond says any experience with muscular necrosis and these guys I've got a small colony with blue dreams jellies and I keep losing the adults and I've never had muscle necrosis in I had an a nice trip I can't I don't think I have actually my muscle necrosis is always caused by like a bacteria and the flesh that kills the actual the sales well that is an unusual one on the right middle you see it has the white it has the the bark line but just in the head so for muscle necrosis you want to keep on top of your water changes and watch the amount you feed because it is it stems from having poor water quality it's the same with fish although you guys that keep fish will get the same things like like like fungus growing and shrimp are things on the fish on the fins all that kind of stuff it's normally to do with bad bacteria and the tank or things like the water might be too cold can often bring on muscle necrosis there's quite a few nice varieties in there isn't it I love it I love it I love it like an oddball in the tank no one is missing is some but I'm looking at this tank guys the tank it doesn't look like this for me that the this is shrimp look more colorful so it's like the color correction is slightly off Vica always is every single streamer have to change stuff on here yeah it is the camera has reset itself from when I used it the last time there you go that and that is more like what it looks like although it's not as white I don't know while the tank looks kind of boyish you think there must be some kind of blur or something but it will do for today my body of a missing your comments have you want to ask me something see our marks shrimp tanks and I'll answer your question do assassin snails eat fry like fish fry and if they can catch them they will I think yes pop 19 say is not going to see your bio make sympathy we're working exceptionally well good let me know how effects your glass in the tank because one in the bacteria that are in it that is why it's known for is biofilm and I'm not telling you which one how much symptoms how can I make my ram's horn ale survive in my soft war tank most my audits inflectra it is like it's a bowel that you're fighting eventually you will lose unfortunately it's my left buttocks it's not like something you can give them and they can get over is as far as I know rate the ROM some snails eventually they will crude somewhere near the center of their shell and once the war gets in there more or less finished so there's not really much you can do but I do believe some snails can repaired themselves from the inside but it's like em it's like having a ship but the hole in the side is eventually it will sink especially with roms monsters because they come up to the surface to breathe I think they do think I'd have to double-check that for sure one in the middle I'd take yeah I don't know what it is I wish the camera was a wee bit closer I won't get one now I would like a snail burnisher was the best in the substrate tank first don't want to have an overrun churn the best deals you can get for multiple shrimp tanks is Malaysian trumpet snails they do well in soft war fresh war ant hard war and I'm saying hard war I mean salt war surprisingly in soft war what they often do will lose the very tip of this of the trumpet the very end will always dissolve away what was that thing something red in that tank just zoomed past no idea what was my friend prepared to steal with plaster of Paris and their work plaster of Paris depends on which one because there's two types as well I was going to experiment or look at that one in the middle you can blue the flashes see that is one although it's not really a really kinda as if there's a little bit red in the tail we can't believe our flesh is that as one you want to breathe from them you want them to breed not you to breathe your Roberts Neil's love cinnamon sticks I bet you they chomp through it how mushroom times choruses can I add snails it might act only has been cycling for ten days cores are you can add the snails from the beginning as soon as you say up to the snails in Malaysian trumpet snails for example are are like cherish them too kind of bomb proof I've heard all kinds of stories with Malaysian trumpet snails like people I'm taking tanks apart they'll not been you know not nothing been in the tank for months and then they went to change the soil or something like that on the Malaysian trumpet snails have still been alive Gabe's aquatics hello welcome to the stream how you doing Gabe Sharon you're very welcome Jerry I did need Lacock because I hate the smell what are you talking about Jay or you hid the smell of cinnamon to me it seems to be a little bit overpowering cinnamon the smell there's a nice sign the one at the front this has eggs yes so I nearly drove these guys to Armageddon but selling too much of them and the summer over the summer this is what happens when you have a tiny little tank this tank is only I think it's 18 litres of war so it's only four gallons and I've sold probably a hundred plus shrimper this time and you can't keep on selling them when the tank is so small and not expect it to eventually stop let me see we're a bomb be report bombing my trumpet snails as mothers are mahkum tanks quarter says for the night respects roll they be okey make yes for sure they will be okay you know alongside their cherish them after the nuclear war there will be Malaysian trumpet snails I actually keep them in salt war with my oppa early you know they always hide the hope earlier I can't show you guys because you'd be looking at empty time he says buffering here is not on my screen to the buffering I noticed the other day when I said that that restream had said my stream had went down so it may be on their end Jerry says Magnus woodland I smashed one with a hammer it didn't sir why would you smash a snail with a hammer Jenny are you lookin a psychopath by any chance Sean says I love listening to your shows and your humor what what like the the born in my leg my humors first thing you see as be required how much shrimp tanks how many did the colony go down to a key the the colony went down to like ten it was so long people were still asking for them another I honestly I can't I can't sell anymore because they're against solo no I'm Gladys this back up now it looks like there's probably about twenty adults in there something like that under unlike quite a lot of low babies we are just go here we talk of it so you can see the vast variation in these guys most people said well I've actually had some comments from other shrimp readers saying why do I keep these shrimp tried it this should be cause I'm like I think I think they're absolutely beautiful shrimp I love that they've got the blue in them you said they can withstand a nuclear bomb and surely they can survive a little hammer you know gonna hammer your shrimp though fuses are you mean your snails aquatic nice hello Vanessa cope we tried a jackhammer a jackhammer yeah these these guys are gorgeous I wish the picture was slightly better you should see the sheen on some of them as well they're really glossy Porter says what pH to keep the shrimp on out that GH in cage it will be seven point two to some point five probably I'm seeing probably because I don't measure it at all pH at the beginning when I first started keeping fish and stuff I used to like go through test kits like like crazy measuring the wort parameters like four or five times a day is just a waste did an absolute waste then when you switch to reverse osmosis war you don't have to do that anymore you save yourself a bit of money on wasted test kits random guy on YouTube this is a good question for everyone here how much would you guys sell s SS s SS + grid Crystal shrimp a random guy it depends on where you live as well I'm here Norway they used to be reasonably expensive but if you go on like things like Facebook groups I know you're not like to sell them anymore look at our scene on that one dead center I know you know I like to sell them anymore but used to get them for like four or five dollars something like that lose these are gone the days are getting decent money for crystals and cherish them for pretty much you owe nothing trickeration per se is our Martian tanks I read that blue really can stay with blue jelly shrimp and not breed wild type probably heard and let me let me let me though well these guys all came from my painted fire Reds on the greeting is just what you see and that is it if I had another tank but I didn't have something else and I would definitely take her some of the blue jelly in this because there's at least three of them on the right-hand side near the bomb there are blue jelly for maybe and then again that's like a different type of shrimp I mean a different type of shrimp that you could have in a colony and your shrimp room that you could sell you could sell blue jellies hello Gabe how you doing mom our trim tanks thanks was worrying because my Colt tank is taking a while to get going I'm with you Leon my favorite because the variations yes I love them aji coarser hello sailor how you doing hello Azalea my butt have you've heard that before been insulted ooh Hello Sailor my part when my local Pfister used to sell date grades ska is falling nine fifty so I could possibly take advantage other yeah I see the thing with stores though is they were always wanting stuff cheaper you know so the guy in this store he probably bought them from someone else for half of what he's selling them for charm says I'm two weeks into running a new tank and shoppin on the shop I get tested and says it's donal ready it won't be ready no two weeks is too soon depends on the type of tank as well but if it's a normal knee or cartegena type tank two weeks is still too soon three weeks is my minimum probably for news Vanessa thank you get these these guys are gorgeous I love them Alice says oh my god he says my curriculum mixed blueberries with blue jelly got released on a few well but not many yeah I really don't seen him wild tapes and my tanks are tall like you can count on like both hands how many times I've seen a wild neo caridina for my tanks I don't really get them I don't really did you get it from me now don't get them at all but that one is dead center it seems to be like sitting there for a full graph it has a really dark bleep oh dude there's one on the left just below the picture here you see as well that's a really nice a really nice blue really isn't it it's a real a nice one of course erimar do you have any salt water of brackish tanks I have one brackish tongue clear that has open early in it but open early you guys ever get them they are known to be super slow and everything you think they're dead they look day they just they just love to hang unsub for the pond Cesare you better want to take care of Phoebe aren't you must be punished as a good one fun house a good one yes so these are my favorite look at the white one because of the type of food we're feeding them as well you can see the white in the digestive tract looks really cool doesn't it you're not kind of see over here look is it down this side below my hand here see that thing that looks like a white worm I think that's a root from an older corn one of the seeds have sprouted maybe hope that's what is marked have you ever considered breathing those fancy lyrics nails in there no Alvin I know which ones you're talking about well no hello fish room fever how are you

there's people in France sailing and there is the fancy ones for 10 euros each yeah I did see that before one of the American sailors had it on Facebook before there was like the animal bond thing calleb says our Martian tanks have you ever used mineral junk apparel food I'm looking for a good mental fit for all of my shrimps mineral junky never even heard of the atom are who makes them I have mineral cubes that's what I use mineral cubes calcium carbonate lots of goodies in it montmorillonite clay different types of bacteria obey it means it's much better even the the other stuff I use the pure nordic mineral sticks is good as well everything else is junk apart from the glass garden stuff I've got to admit I do like the glass garden fruits those guys know what they're doing it's not big just little robin pheasant no I can't watch it out door clips come watch it I don't know what it is I may be one of those species that like I mean I eat meat but I don't want to see things being killed cores are the other day when you're telling me about your job I was like please don't please don't tell me what you're doing in that and that place please please you know I suck I think I saw a clip on Facebook or something and it was it was a dog being tortured or some crap like that and I have rib solutely raged and a posting on facebook said the next person that shows me any of this effing animal would be startled with effing bonding or hate it hate it so much because it stays in my mind for like days I can think you know once I see something on like Facebook or any social media thing like that has any kind of animal beasts it stays in my mind for days and I can't stop thinking about glass garden stuff is good what's my thoughts on borscht ramps I would love to have some but money speaks volumes and you can't really get them where I am oh I see Magnus I use Glasgow mineral junky everything alive loves it damn you Marcus my steals our breathing our control or any thoughts and how to control it Britta mmm just feed laces the only answer or get in there and remove the snails put them somewhere else that course that I think you knew that wasn't wanting to hear what you were saying but you told me any was that you mother Marc you're gonna make me cry yeah I hate when people tell me stuff I hate it Facebook is a great place to find a bad mitt your face I love what is with Facebook I go in there it is there's like lots of people on there and I'm I look at my group on my own page and then I'm straight off again I don't know what it is about Facebook it just doesn't stick with me very much Facebook it seems to be like a free-for-all for anything on Facebook I know that's the the idea behind the bar when there was one in the scenes I think I told you guys this before on my timeline someone posted the video array there's a guy up on a building clearly hi this building was like six stories up or something the guy is clearly high and he jumps off the building right and he lands like you can imagine he goes like this by and he lands saw his buck starts to bend like that and he just kept on going any in his box snapped in half you can see him like wriggling in line they're moving I'm like why the hell did you post that on Facebook you mother why Facebook is yeah it feels like he's out of control your shrimps are the best I have ever seen says thank you sure so help to lick me until I came here I never knew her interesting there oh that's a good thing to hear it's early sorry marking guys colleague that's never a problem never be sorry for being late Jack you're you're correct that's what I'm seeing more and more of his face book equals hate I don't like it when you even have on Facebook and even how groups of people that go around just to hate people you like what's where is that was appointing him existing I have had on this YouTube channel before where a group came in here and there they were all caught called like offensive names right but they figure that I was okay so they left me alone seanix exactly I hate Cena I absolutely hate this just I have to tell you guys this but Alice Alice works in a slaughterhouse how to tell you no she doesn't before she gets abused you she doesn't kiss a is just one say thanks for the different music today it's the same music Facebook is for when I don't have a friend's phone number it's one of those places I really don't want to go on anymore Facebook I go on there run a competition check my grip check my messages and then straight up again but dark means it seems to be meme heaven or Facebook or being BMW don't get me wrong I'm not having a goat your channel here because there everybody has different things like I'm saying I don't like seeing it but there's nothing to see that if if I was put in the same situation where I had to hunt for food I wouldn't I would still do it probably still never had to go and share Robert I would probably I just don't like seeing them so don't take offense I didn't mean I didn't mean that in a bad way about your channel everybody has their own hobbies and interesting stuff I mean I I still go fishing some people and the chart may not like the idea of fishing and killing fish and all that kind of thing everybody has their own interests and hobbies John Lamond I've never seen that name before is he new course I said that's why I nearly Facebook Neal changed ten years ago Prince drama yes it does heads 9 6 9 hello I got a question I need to move my crystal restaurant position I have I remove it into the water for 50 minutes and fill that back in the same but is it risky um no that's it's not as risky as you think as long as you just be prepared to support your time when you move it because 20% of the water still in the tank is still quite a lot when I move house dies that way I move a shrimp tanks are drain as much of the water as possible you only have to leave a little bit in the tank ray and in ornaments and stuff just moved light all on its side covered the top I used to cover them and just lit cling from then then blankets and stuff [Music] then move the tank and then just fill it back up again everything should be fine and I did that with a pause in between of hours actually stepped on the Polish poll this morning he go for a good 30 seconds or I spend the next 45 minutes bawling my eyes out he's fighting the tech person pain just ripped my heart oh you know I feel I feel bad for something I do with Lucy sometimes you know she goes out of control and late times to the bar thing hey I'm talking like four or five hours of just constant barking and I know the one thing that she doesn't like and I use it sometimes I against herb because I know it stops her barking and it's a thing called a flu smoker it's like a flyswatter it's an electronic thing and when I when I go and grab this thing she is absolutely petrified but I think she has to learn that you can't bark constantly all night as much as I love her you know lucky sleep can make a hell of a cranky when this is is so bad ray that when we went camping I told you guys like the third for stream bark the same story there was kids playing badminton she was absolutely petrified because they're holding those Rockets that look like the truce market hunted meet over factory farm saison I just installed Facebook for Facebook you installed Facebook for Facebook dating is that even a thing Sean says that's exactly what I do to on Facebook minute the other thing as well rate is is I don't I'm not speaking about any you guys so don't think what a lot of people are too personal and Facebook you know the information that this year you know just because you're friends with someone doesn't mean you want to know they're like life story and the relationships and like if their husband is cheating on the more you're welcome five Oh what did I miss something did I miss something I heard something electro SWAT yet she hates it Jeff yes g'day mate how you doing my oldest barks when I use the fly smoker are there some times that you just you don't want us to see because their secret breeding programs let me think of it uh I I'm really happy to think of it it's hard but now all my tanks you've either seen or I haven't shown you because they're like the bottom ones over here that the light is just gone it's still on I don't know if you can even see over there you see it the light is still on but the light is so far it's hard to see Oh Pirelli they're just not doing well they're in the tank but but I've heard people keep these shrimp for like a year before they come out of hiding like what I really saw like scared and hide me hide BMW door clips thank you that was an awesome coming I'm telling you Porter's way more shrimp in there than I thought you know the know that little coming out there we hide ahold of stuff hello MTW but as licious sleep alone or in the same room k-licious sleeps with me right actually either on me now normally Lucy sleeps em between my legs are actually at nighttime which can be a pain because I overhear a little bit when she does this but every night is the same she doesn't really she lies in between my legs she may have a separation anxiety maybe Jarno brought rolled-up newspaper no I'll never intentionally hurt her I'm are some tanks my mr. snails in my blue boat tank just laid eggs should I move the clutched in the tank before the harsh the parents have been in this tongue since the harsh last year um if you have another tightest harder war yes I would move them basically he paused too long thinking about whether he should tell us a secret breeding program and then decides against that this man is smart keeping his secret see you child hello wait a minute you children aren't you I thought I recognized you did you change your name you chill No maybe did yes so there's way more shrimp in this stunt than I thought there was which is really nice to see it means they're making a good comeback lots of them saddles there as well don't don't take it for granted that all of these are sad also because the white part in the pendulum is just the digestive tract for the benefit and it dog that barks for no reason has issues oh I don't mean lucy barks from a reason we live in the countryside with tropical hello australia we live in the countryside I think Arliss is testing me there we live in the countryside here so we have things like deer walking through a garden foxes old arcana stuff you chill says I've been a viewer for years though for harm the cache the streams you okay you chilled me I recognized your picture that's why she probably just once marked impossible in her or no honestly guys she does it because she sees things outside like a car cart we'll go through the garden lessly she was crazy fellow Scotsman hello there you chill how's it going through in the wee bit squash there for you it's funny you talk about being squashed and then I started speaking skosh again yes it has not been trained enough no it's like the kids like make her try and do tricks for food and stuff I'm like no don't do that don't make her beg for food maybe she wants bedtime she a couple hours early um no I I know for sure guy says the animals inside the house she's not barking for no reason of us we you think John sometimes is anxiety dog is always on guard yes 5:43 in Melbourne Australia Michael thorne Lee Wildlife Foundation hello sir welcome to the stream you must be shattered staying up Valley yeah but it's the the the thing with the newspaper is the same thing with the flue smoker she she knows that it makes like it's like a zip noise PG or Li no just subscribed welcome to the shrimp farm PG dogs hearing is incredibly acute compared to humans - yeah I know I know I can't imagine what she hears that side of course I know what we heard one night would just line there I don't think the wife was barred from working me ELISA just line there and it sounded like like something screaming in the woods behind the house and I heard a noise like what what the f was and Lucy instantly jump up like what the hell was like anything and I'm sure it was a fox because I think I've heard the Fox screaming before so how about those shrimp hardly looking gorgeous even though the camera is slightly crap yesterday my dogs always barking she hears a car come doing my Roth there's things before he gets here it's the same with Lucy in the nighttime the wife come comes from a bit two o'clock in the morning Lucy will sit up and like look at the window a good minute before the car comes past but I think she might see that like lights or something because there's a road like calamari I think she makes it up you know good dog protects you from evil deer and spooky shadows you better believe a dealer incredibly evil credible evil have you not seen the way they're like smash their hips into your face are Jerry was still Jerry still experimenting I think so there was a bond she was a banshee I've heard up the tent a van Gogh banshee I trained my dog and a cage when I say go to bed dog was to ask it face tropic I think you're talking about humans they are you you you've named one of your humanist family dog you used to do all the fish bring videos for me just watch the shrimp Jared well I've never had any fish on YouTube ever I think you must be confusing me with someone else death of my favorite shrimp says mark million pavilion but these ones I like the I like the the the way they look with them you know one have their braid in the head and red in the tail and have that slightly blue body and then it looks so cool when they have eggs as well because you get that yellow in there that's what I want to get this year we're going into next she wants to get tanks more tank set up as orange lilies think the looks gorgeous and release dogs need dominance or don't own one role in my opinion no never my puppy Lucy is my equal love conquers all not hate there's no need for bullying Agustin tongue a dog see dead people though so Jared Wales hello again yeah they definitely hear what we can hear I haven't heard of a bunch you have no idea what it is a banshee I was probably screaming Fox mark or maybe a we're as probably some Norwegian weirdo maybe like Alice and they would screaming my fault card bhishan's growing up they bred twice they don't yes that's that's the awesome thing of you Lucy she doesn't lose her hair all over the place God thank you wise decision ESPN dogs are excellent yeah me too mark on green Jets yeah exactly definitely green shades for next year on the orange release I can see four specs for from experience nothing shows up a dog faster than the scream of a Pima cougar mountain lion he said I thought banshees were from Scotland I've never heard that before action upon she I've heard the word but no I don't know what it is that's what you think until my deciced about you Lucy's never gonna bait me ever I've had dogs before it's not like the first time I've had a dog Scotland also has AI has eyewitnesses of werewolves I can't remember what was that that move the American Werewolf in London what did those guys rate in the beginning did they not go backpacking in Scotland or in the end the Welsh countryside or something boxers are crazy [Music] of course are you a big hug there that's nice I'm coming mythical screaming ghost thingy yes I'll have to I'll have to Google what a bunch is although I've actually googled banshee as tent before so all my other ads on Facebook YouTube are all 10 others ever hear a banshee you're gonna die twice please no please no happy kinda sick it's common as hell for review she's a pedigree slightly less than I until she is often leak you know what I see with box resist they're always like bone see like hoppin around all the time there was a video on on I think it was on Facebook actually but dog watching a boxer bouncing on an hour would you call trampoline and that dog was bouncing in the living room living room watching the dog and the TV bouncing on the trampoline fine she is assure hello Jeff I don't say much why I learn a lot just from watching thank you great stuff Jeff you're very welcome you'd have to speak more often boxers are a great family dogs so funny yeah they look hilarious they've they're really full of personality I think boxers I wear awful cry like a real babies cry or women and distressed to learn you to it Sharon are you werewolves by any chance see how do you know this stuff boxing like having a puppy for three years very protective and good with children but they drool everybody asks I've seen that but they're very cool though they're very cool they're marching tanks if you could only keep one strain type of shrimp what would you choose that's a really good question actually one shrimp tank that would make me still be relatively happy to have shrimp if it was like the perfect tank perfect breeding colony big adults lots of babies my thing [Music] it would be my blue steel blue bolt tongue the story came from a true story of a wolf in Scotland jared says a real-ass embarrassin there's a Khyber channel for MRSA kwatak son and he happens to be from UK or something so you guys had a similar st. Gerard is 100% okay Mark's aquatics is one of those guys the more or less I don't want to add fuel to the fire but he started calling himself me Mark's shrimp stuff different videos when there was no need to and he made a huge deal about so you know like can you imagine if you had a brand rain because I I actually own my name on YouTube you all do you all worn your name right so either there's only one of you in YouTube there's only one mark shrimp tanks so you can imagine how ho but it could be if if someone comes along and names the channel Markstrom when I when I'm already called mark shrimp tanks that was a kind of situation the guy just like you just didn't get it you saw one in 1975 a women that's when I was born there are many Alice's in Norway and there's also billions of Dennis's in Denmark should be like that scene from Highlander where the two guys failure in with the giant swords the electricity coming down and you know I chopped the head off the other guy and see they can only be one my walk my box I've twisted this she is too well behaved but full of energy always plays gentle with the kids twice a day that's a bit law I walk Lucy at least minimal four times a day I've ever had to guess the kilometers of I walk is probably with four to six climbers a day here buddy generous Gerry reef says I've got some Turkish hazelnut bolsters on older corns which I found out some green mold in them fungus on it I don't want to boil them could I add them to the tank without issue he's a mole stirs what is that is that the actual cup of the hazelnut I don't know what that is all their cones even with the molding anything like that on it yes you can poo in the Turkish this like care for sure were designed to eat mold fungus bacteria that grows and stuff that's what their design tea for real four times yes after the stream finishes our Walker again as good as good though because before we got Lisi right which will be I was gonna say two years ago I don't think it's even been two years since we've had this II am I'm not kidding guys I couldn't walk 100 years I couldn't walk 100 meters because my back was so twisted and bent over ever since we've got

guys doing this is Neil from perfect Sun LED calm and Africa is a grow update for you so I'm going to show you guys really quickly what what plants we have going on and then we'll play the actual video update where you'll see me in real time training this blue dream back here and I'll show you some cool trick on how you can do an alternative type of mainlining training that i'm doing for the blue dream which is a photo period these are the three Auto flowers I'm gonna give a quick update for those that haven't been watching what three plants these are how old they are and then I have two different videos so I'm gonna be showing both of them so one at 46 days old which is this one and then another one at 56 days also ten days later you can see how the training took in just ten days alright so here we have the Afro DITA and this is at Auto flower I believe that one is by world of seeds and so Auto flower obviously this one here is the glue berry og which when I click very soon the gorilla glue OG or the grail of gluten allergy just guerrilla glue my fast buds and all that and back here is in New York City diesel auto flower by I believe advanced seeds and so anyway yeah there you go that's the day 46 now I'll show you at day 56 and then we'll go ahead and go to action over the update and then I'll talk about some cool things some some grow tips and stuff and things to avoid alright alright so before we get to the actual video where I do real-time update here I show you guys the plants in real time which I don't do very often here we go so we have the afroditi this is only ten days later the afroditi the Gorilla Glue and then back here we have the New York New York City diesel and behind over here we have the blue dream which I could show you really quickly you can see how much she's recovered we'll go through this again now well actually you know it this video does it human you can kind of see her back there a little bit right there blue dream I thought yeah you can't see like that back there you can see she's recovered quite a bit but we'll go and go through these videos and I'll come back and talk about some tips of stuff and what we've been doing alright hey how you guys doing so doing a quick update here this is the Blue Dream this is a photo period what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start mainlining here I think to make her stay short and bushy I don't know I kind of don't want to do a full main line I just don't know if I'm gonna have enough time to do that because it does take a while for a plant to grow at the full main line but main line training is like where you just keep two branches on the bottom and then you let those go out horizontally should start at that earlier if I was gonna do that so instead I'm going to do is see how kind of bowl changer right now I'm gonna take off the top several nodes and a couple branches and then I'm gonna leave all those bottom branches down there and I'll say that looks like in just a second old old-time video for those that remember that's inside Joe if you guys but you're an old watcher so anyway here he goes I cut off the whole entire top there that can actually make it really nice I can make some nice clones out of that there's a lot of clones on there I can make but I don't like here to clone the blue dream and then I'm going to take these branches I'm going to tie them down to the edge but the main ones I want to take the long I'm really beginning to dislike these edge phones I really hope the next generation has an on edge version because I've even turned off edge functionality and it still sometimes just holding the phone try and record it'll like kill the peak Alex I'm trying to do something with it I think I take off a few of the bottom branches and I'm gonna tie these branches down I wanted to grow horizontally because this is a horizontal room well it's a square room but I grow an 8 by 4 of it so I want it to go eight by eight way right so the four way I want to have only a couple branches smaller ones go into this way cover the four direction and the other branches I want them to try to go as long as possible to cover the long direction so that's the goal here I should have started that kind of training earlier but oh well okay now here when I could something I do that real quick and I'll show it look like all right in the end I have it tied down like that so I have these three branches going that way those two branches going that way that's gonna be the horizontal way and these two here I'll just be there for a little bit of the other way the shorter distance the four-foot distance alright cool and really quickly here's the rest of the plants we've got New York City Diesel back there they all almost died because she forgot to water and they were like almost dead and I was gonna throw them out start over but they for the most part recovered it definitely is going to reduce their yield and not only is going to reduce their yield but it's gonna it's gonna reduce probably well when it reduced their size big time I think that New York City sort of got a lot bigger but it's you know it's 2 and 1/2 feet so I'm like that this one I'm actually surprised the grille glue shut up because she was really small and then the afroditi alfredito it's about how big she would be anyway she's not a very big plant besides she's not fully into flour yet so she might still stretch more these two are probably out there at their final sizes they might get a little bit bigger but not much so that's the new york city diesel really blew by fast boats and aphrodesia these three autos that ones the photoperiod that's getting trained for when these ones finish I might even start a couple more autos so that my time they are this big these ones will be done and then I can give that photo period extra time to veg so Jen's a pretty serious training on it as you can see I'll see bahala see how she looks when these are almost done well now if I do that then I can't plant autos so I got I got to decide soon upon the plateaus or not I can just plant them I guess what they don't and just give that thing extra time to bed just for the hell of it good to heavens anyway so there we go that's the update she's starting to put on a little bit of sugar on the leaves as you can see there that's the grill of glue afroditi says she's not fully flowering yet so she does have little ways to go and then New York State Diesel back there you can also see the New York City Diesel especially since it was trying to recover the light was too intense for her you can see yeah not leaf right that's those things are just too much intense I moved over to the corner more this kind of stuff my wife doesn't you know fully know how to do yet is you know thinking about stuff on the fly like when stuff happens and so I've been trying to get in here but my health makes it very difficult well yeah so alright cool alright cool so that was update let's go and look at some cool stuff here I want to talk about with the plants and things to watch out for some little you know tips that you can look out for when you're growing let me see I'm gonna go ahead and turn off the sound when I play this that way so here here's the update here and I want to show you guys I think there's a part here loosing bias this is under the perfect son max yield right now we just have one light on this whole time also keep in mind this is without co2 once again because I haven't been able to get down and actually fill the tank up yet but you know as you can see honestly so there's the blue gene this I want to show you that's probably the best shot I'm gonna get right there so here's the blue dream now you can see that she's recover nicely this is all the new growth and so under my light the lights so intense that's really gonna show you like the difference between new growth and an older growth you see how much brighter green the new growth is this is this as normal you know you can see some new growth here too that's fine so don't worry about it but yeah you can see that so look how much she's recovered already look how much more bushes she as you can see these these branches already starting to grow out wider and taller and I'm gonna keep on training these three branches and these three branches to grow this way horizontally like this way this way so I gotta come back here we got to put some cutting to do is tie some bamboo sticks or put some holes is he on we're in fabric pots so we'll put some holes here on the sides of the pots and then had the bamboo sticks going through like that and then we'll tie down the branches to the bamboo sticks as it grows I'll show you guys a diagram what I'm talking about here in just a second so that will be cool anyway so that's what we're under the blue dream and I was debating whether or not I should start more on flowers and then let her really veg out even longer since I'm doing such intense training to her but then I was like well I don't know what if then what if she veg is way too long it's way too big I gotta control you know so I think I'm doesn't go ahead and see what happens here with this so right now these are at day 56 you know and so I don't know we'll say at day 56 that means I probably whether you're looking now especially the afro DITA I don't think that Perdita is gonna finish and tell like man probably day 86 I'm thinking another Sami sick she might and then either twenty days she might be close to being done I think the New York City so I think that won't be a lot closer to being done in twenty days I'm something that she has another you know anywhere from twenty to thirty days longer I can veg out after that I have to fetch her for because these ones aren't gonna be finished yet and that I actually want to veg her a little bit longer after that cuz I want to give her the full length of they buy four to really try to Train her out to be you know as big as possible in there I just don't and also I probably should transplant her because right now she's still in a small pot so we have to transplant her into another pot I should play I do that to your very soon and we'll put over here on this side right now she's just had this little corner this whole time so I think it's time to move over here under her own light and put her in a bigger pot and let her start really taking off because she's recovered now about ten days after this hard training and she she's recovered she's growing nicely she's grew a lot within that ten days you see help me like little leave she had in the other video look how many believe she has now so yeah it's scary I know like even my wife was like oh my god he killed the plant but I've done this before so you just the first couple times you do it is kind of freaky when he do that kind of intense training because you like took almost all the branches off and all the leaves off and you're like always she kind of recover from this and she does look at she's fine so yeah anyway so let's go ahead and look at some other stuff here some tips and I want to show you guys how we're gonna train that plan out further I also I'm gonna be starting another grill inside the bedroom so with with some vegetables by adding my throw like one CBD Otto flower in there because CBD actually the CBD strains have really been helping her so she can smoke more regular weed without having the you know the paranoia or the panic the kind of panic attacks that come with it when you smoke too much THC not everyone is affected by that but she is so the kind of like half and half the one to one ratio stuff where you have let's say a percent CBD and eight percent THC if she smokes some of that before she smokes regular strong stuff that really helps so we're and we're going to grow some of our own so I got a nice CBD strain I'll be good I'll be showing you guys and that's an as it'd be it'd just be a bedroom Burrow so it's starting to cool off so I think it won't be too hard to keep it cool in there we're gonna be do that in a glide the Goliath of v2 and just in case because then I know like I think if I run out of room in there like last time I don't use a light move or something so the by a few - lets the plants get really close within like a foot away from the light without burning them so I think I'm going to grow a pepper plant or two as well and then maybe some lettuce or something so we'll see and it's a much easier for me to get in it to get in that bedroom and go all the way out on the garage so I should be able to go in there on a more regular basis and do little video updates for you guys alright so here well I want to show you guys after d-day up close see this right here I've talked about this before but for those that haven't watched all my backlog videos I'll talk about this right here again you see the edge the teeth of the leaves how they're pointy you have a really sharp and then they start curling up like this there's a couple things that can cause that the most common is gonna be light stress or heat stress in this case I know it's not too hot in the room and so she's just not handling the light very much so she was pretty close to light I think they're I think they're actually a little bit closer she's a little bit closer I think than two feet away I think she was about eighteen inches away she obviously doesn't like that so this was a good thing so afroditi if you want to plant that you know like gorilla glue where they don't need as much light then this is a good plant for that so I can tell I've heard EDA is not a it's not a heavy light plant and so I should move her over and so if I if I would have been in there every day this would have been done before these leaves got this curled up but this is the you know they can handle this kind of stress right here this isn't really gonna harm any thing actually sometimes I like to push them this far maybe not this far but almost this far because it's gonna really help them pack on the density and weight I always like to try to get the light as close as possible without like stressing them too much but a little bit stress is fine so I'll probably do with this one is just have her move it out a little bit like about four inches toward the corner you know so right now it's more toward the center of light just move it out toward the corner more and then she'll be fine another thing that could cause this would be like something like magnesium deficiency or something but she doesn't have that she's fine and so she's still kind of early in her flowering stage just she's just barely in her beginning flower stage look at this she says that the other ones are definitely more ahead of her so yeah I thought that she was a very fast plant but keep in mind if you get a Perdita I don't know this might just be this particular female if you get afroditi it might it might be an 80-day plant 85 day plant because she definitely takes her time so there's the blue gym again the blue gym is the photo period there's there's the where I cut it off right here the whole top took all that off I left you know these branches these branches and those branches down there sink I left three nodes you can look how much leaves they've grown since last time pretty crazy yeah she's ready to probably be transplanted now and in the next couple days will definite answers now it's now technically like two days later so this was on November well I have the dates written down hold on there we go so November 2nd was day 56 now two of them the New York City diesel and the grill glue actually three days ahead might has been talking about these dates because I I messed up somewhere on the dates anyway so and I think it's I think they're more closer to this but whatever it's fine so that was November 2nd which is this last video the first video I showed you but when I was trying to burn out my sari I was kind of confused there the first video I showed you where I did the training when I'll show you how I cut it and stuff and train the branches down tied the branches down that was way back in October my third one they were 42 46 days old now right now it's November 4th so just so you know what you know this was I'm basically showing you a video this video right now you're looking at was taken two days ago so or two days from this day if you watch it November 4th ok so anyway but yeah so you can see how much further along the Gorilla Glue is Gorilla Glue by fast buds usually finishes a day about 65 68 deathly should be finished by day 70 so I'm thinking that this will be the first one to come out so she's a fast fast finishing plant and she doesn't usually care for much light but look it she's actually decently close to light is actually unfortunate though that they weren't watered correctly so you can see she actually suffered a little bit here with some uptake probably calcium uptake where she sees little hole like little looks like little burn leaves or burn holes in the leaves but for the most part she's fine you can see it's hard to kind of see what this lighting but you can see look she's starting to pack some sugar on these leaves here you can see all these see all those little nice sugar spots so yeah she looks like she's gonna be nice once she starts really packing on that weight you know right now like like that you know once the buds start looking like this I start stacking up this is when they really start packing on the weight she was in New York City so you can see that the hair is all nice and white and fluffy still but within the next 20 days she's gonna really start swelling up and she might actually be done in 20 days so I think that the gorilla glue will probably be done right now it's day 56 let's say so I'm thinking by yeah 50 60 not far not far away less than 20 days in for her I think we'll see and then New York City Diesel she might go to day 76 so she applied she might have another 20 days from the day that I told you how old these are not necessarily from how long you've watched his video but time you watch this video that might be long done you might be watching this video in 2022 or something who knows but yes so there you go cool you can see kinda how far away the light is right there the New York City Diesel I think is the closest to the light right now that's why I moved her over to the corner more so she's not under the center of the light she's more toward the corner of the light and yeah so but she's doing really good I think I might rearrange them though might raise the light a little bit and rearrange the plants this one the blue James gonna go over here under its own light I think I'm gonna move to maybe move the New York City some more toward the center this one I can't keep up more over here on the edge because she doesn't need that much light and then Gorilla Glue doesn t much light either I think I'm gonna move these more to the edge and have the New York City so kind of occupy the center more of the light and raise the light just a little bit so she's not so close to the center of it yeah so I'd be good so I'm raising about two feet above her which is good about 24 inches so all right cool so that's it guys thanks for watching hope you guys enjoyed the video I thought it had something else I wanted to talk about but I don't think I do yeah I can't think of anything else right now if you have any questions though about growing all that kind of stuff definitely go ahead and leave comments in the video I appreciate that and if you guys want to what lights I grow up I put that in the beginning of the video which is perfect son LED calm the link is also in the description go check those lights out as of right now what as of right now when to make the day that this video came out I have in stock the dwarf stars the minis let's see here what else I believe the Goliath the glide v2s are going to be ready any day now so yeah the Goliath fetus and also I'll have more max yields really any day now as well so stay tuned for that so those two big lights the mega I don't know when those will be back in stock again I'm not only worried about that right now I'm really just trying to focus on the glide fee too and see you you know because a lot of people been asking for that kind of design so we'll see how that does for a little while and then I'll then I'll bring back the mega maybe but for now that's filling in that that particular portion but yeah anyway so that that's the update for the lights and yeah definitely go check them out like I said the glide fee too should be in stock any or be ready any day now to ship again that's the same thing as saying be in stock and then max yield maybe about another I'm hoping within a week that they'll be ready to ship to alright double peace thanks for

surprised that a human being is capable of understanding how I feel it's a shame there's a Geo weapon incubating in your planet that will destroy everything shortly but you don't deserve that do you geo weapon huh you know I really shouldn't be here but I'm glad I came back one last time I can save one last piece of her legacy oh yeah that's a big arm down your Imus stop Stevan opposite i'm sorry

garnet we're going to space we're going to get him back [Music]", "s5tFVGB1M84": "the thing that's going to make blue dreams so completely unique is that it's going to be like a suite of of piano music the pieces all connect but between them sometimes it's piano that connects it sometimes it's going to be a cello quartet sometimes it's going to be African drums we're going to go through a world of music but it's all going to be connected start to finish this will be a perhaps 74 and single piece of music you'll be able to access the individual tracks but you can listen to this almost as a symphony it's going to run continuously it's not that it's a group of pieces that are three minutes 50 seconds long this is going to be one flowing work of music moving through a whole lot of different styles with a wide range of of instruments but with a piano at the center of it I mean no one has done Blue Dream is recorded as a single piece of music kind of like a film score it has been it has a storyboard and its interwoven and it's connected as a single something classical players are really only giving you what was written on a sheet you know she invests everything she plays with tremendous emotion and herb it's it's not this academic thing with her you know she's feeling this stuff she's writing it I think to the idea of blue dream becoming this suite of music being connected on the way that it's going to be is going to be something absolutely unique for me I've never done that before and it's very very rare especially in the world of a new age and and you know jazz recordings so this is a very different project this is a very distinctive project and I think she's the perfect person to pull it off I think everybody should enjoy bleeding people looking for good music out there in a world of bad music um well as a journey it takes people through it I think people look like that now they got something to help you know pull him through yeah I think I think it's going to appeal to a wide range of people I think the audience for blue dream is going to be very very broad she has the chops of a classical player she has the rhythms of of jazz players and she has this lovely romantic soul I think that you know whether it's classical listeners who are willing to take a chance and go out beyond established classical repertoire and for the Jazz listeners who you know and can hear elements of rhythm that they they find familiar and us and certainly the the New Age listeners all of these people will love this record I think blue train will be enjoyed right instrumental music like piano music people who want to sit back and relax and go into a piece of music and be taken somewhere else by a piece of music will understand the underlying message emotional content but really the thing that makes it work is that she is so connected to the source of the music she is so connected to the emotional center it's real I believe her there's a there's a thing in music it's it's I just call it voice you know you can hear a couple of notes of somebody and recognize their style Fiona feels that way to me I think she's very true to herself you", "QYY5vVuit1Q":

so they don't become of our failed experiment quite soon okay so I can see what I'm T's actually playing because we're going to be adjusting our game plan based on what our opponent is doing and that's when the key things this deck he is quite a reactive deck in that respect so he is actually not playing first so I'm going to play a land here for our han might get punished a little bit if he's playing rush but not a lot of rush players around anymore green rush probably being the only popular rush deck that's about at the moment even then frog Rifai being so powerful this blue deck being quite popular now as well greenish can get punished by frog fights they do have them I'm expecting war storm that sucks generally my expectation how we ever late okay so this could very well be a mirror and we'll have to see so we'll take a take another lake to this side got the ice on them so I collected for a mark I'm going to zip here collect from here double neutral next turn try and take this leg spot we might neutral neutral Lake here so we have a good Archon spot in the future as I said in my video though these these well spots here great for our comms because of their charge and how they can get around the well very easily explore in too late no it's going to double neutral Queen's guards okay but this isn't America's going to be a mid-range blue so we're going to just retreat we don't advise it he gets double collection but we get double questions well when we develop a neutral next turn I could've actually you know I can really move there not without a bus you've got the herald you can tap this icon and there is the dream hmm so blind storm spawn on its own is quite dangerous I just because you know we we can get this fragra fired so we pay 10 spirit they play pay for ferry and we just lose six area and a card not very good I think it's time to start drawing cards although if these playing mystic beast I'll probably want this spot so I'd have a double neutral here but I haven't got much else going on apart from that and I don't really like it when four would be perfect right now I'm going to take the draw so the Frog fire we're just going to leave this Ark on here and now a movement trick will be a bit sad he could maybe sunken power double neutral into banquets I could be a clear on this guy privatized if he's running it not sure its offensive he's running Kings dance list I believe dance actually runs the sunken towers I can actually check let's have a look what happens I have this on the on the hub as you know that you play opposite sides and King down to this also runs Queen's Guard so cops reduce pirates there as well low fees pretty nice rally olofi horas a lucky for us if it's a six six on board doesn't bring me any closer to this but then we have so we have to kind of analyzed can I actually dream at this point that's that's so much that's a really good question I'm looking at it I'm just looking at his potential list Vulcan dies had des this been running falcon dies right now alright see I'm not sure this play is correct or not I will look at it I'm gonna go forever in a law thief now or to win full of probably change things for me yeah thicker or so now oh my eyes awesome so there's a really good pickup very mobile will be able to double collect Queens cards pretty nice as well to give us some FIRREA not not a bad result there with the Aurora say for four to six is generally a good number to go to and six to eight to six to eight stuff like ice rock behemoth wild is on an eight I can think of I did have an old list of but I was talking about my guys I looted an unmanned evolution guy so eight drops wave crash Colossus is seven air Bayrou ogre battler ice rock behemoth those three is still the same so that's a good that's a good jump to from three to five five has so many different options that is crazy so that's that but for some more high variance transformations of rah say the yes so we did there see other buff with the Enchantress might just frog Rifai this doesn t seem worth it promise a row say can't escape what fragra Phi is actually pretty nice because it means that we have to use both of these that kill or or a say as long as it's not an enchantment around really either windfall to get these archons active let's take the Frog afire then I think fairly litter so yeah we we have our thing now which can contest both of these creatures use another enchantment or enchantress to clear this and then it's they trade off and lessee has protection so that's pretty good retreat mmm tough rock of five his own this one of my twine around the place right now it's a nice barrier gain for the combat ability they take it over the six which means we play another Herald using something our pumpkin tower the dance version uses tides so perhaps aunty subscribe to go for sunken tower instead he's going to remove here enchant and then clear that will never fragra fire okay to modify as well so I'm very start of Syria and my opponent is taking control the board you go from Marin let's let's just hold fire and hit windfall if and hits windfall I'm going to be happy I've still this one's not bad but I need to failed experiment for it to be any good so win Falls kind of the the best option I can have I'm guessing that's going to be a herald or a tyrant axe the difference our car makes in this matchup is huge simply because our comms are six sixes they challenge most of mid blues creatures a lot of their creatures top out at 5 4 5 attack none of them really have don't really have any six sixes II they create six sixes from using Gabe reason chanters and enchantment so our cons are incredibly relevant in this matchup because of that because it's just so much harder for them to kill them good cheap Colossus er you can actually tower move and then hit most hit Michael why do have radiance ready yak attack I might do this to be honest creation on Baron just so I can kill the Colossus so I can do this yeah I can do this so creation clear and then I can put to environment into this and hopefully pick up like double windfall and then I'll be laughing double windfall at zero cost that gives me dream so is he going to go for my oldest turn you can actually move this go for my orbit and you can push damage of both of these it's going to be pretty deadly I bet it we got attack off fire and that's pretty decent to are you going to move it up one move cross another queensguard push the seven front steps people I well he has lethal just with this guy right now and I'm dead to an enchantress so I need some class drawers here ah serious ah no that's exactly what I wanted to give these guys and then alright first our list at the satisfy renewed wait wait we were worried I have a good heel here actually I remember the first bone in plus 1 into radiance put the radiance okay so put that let's put the 1st Baron in win for very nice use this for the next Baron in fragra Phi and we can play windfall which takes us up to 20 so it's not enough token radiance here the new yak attack yeah the radiance here fall again yak yak yak Bob when that time guys so I mean 11 flicker with this I could have played a roller they're actually just clear my are [ __ ] and they kill him well and there we go that's this is an example of some of the turns you're going to have to make with this deck it's a it's tough you need to kind of spot these little intricacies and then just trying to make the best one you can I can't even guarantee that the waltz of sy it's just the line that I spotted and the time I had left so we'll see I didn't even get to dream like I had all that Faria but I didn't have time to use it because I'm playing against a more aggressive deck MIT is a mid-range deck so it has kind of aggro control hybrid right and he put a lot of pressure on me early if I was playing against another control deck I probably would have time to dream in that situation but I have to just remove his board and Reagan have taught me up quite nicely the system again wrecked by fragra Phi which is awesome I get to push 10 damage next turn as well you could have sub Landon to me and just move me if I go from a to 10 o'clock with radiance now chant for us so just try to make it easier to kill maybe the radiance next to a falcon sighs okay fine missus area you can move that land in front of me that you can do anything because it doesn't block oh yes I move it here yeah that makes sense alright dear top 12 I love left click the draw failed experiment so I can do that next to with storm spawn so this still will just frog Rifai clear and once it's clear wanna sit on this well in all paths and then if he comes to double-click next turn I can take land but I can kill the Enchantress when I collect and collect from this whale I push 10 damage next in unless he blocks me it's pretty dangerous for him but I'm hoping he uses this tower because once he uses this tower I'm going to move radiance on to one of his lands and develop a lake and that will be my aggressive lake for my archons so if I picked up another creation I can then creation my our command just start pushing 6 which is really powerful I've seen some players now and I think some aliens actually done it putting Gabriel warden in a step to make the archons more sticky you know and stick to the board more they take the protection off instead of removing them because of how valuable they are in this deck so that could be a great adjustment when you're playing this let's try as the wardens in the spa maybe to drop a yak attack maybe a creation if it's a bit clunky for you I got I have in the deck doctor some suggestions randoms light-bearer's so maybe you could use those suggestions for the warden I haven't tried to make myself personally but just a suggestion pyronite pretty good blocking me from killing the double coin so I'm going to take failed experiment storm spawned first then I'll do law thief and I'll defy what I'm gonna do from there we can use multi Paz a collector on this side there we go creation nice okay so move him here take a lake nation into and there we go you know straight away as soon as those are calm start coming easing way too much trouble so yeah that's that's the first match let's see how I do in the next one alright let's get into the next match guys and see how I do this time who do we have we have a play I've never played into before so not too sure what he's going to complain but I'm sure I'll find out soon so Magnus not really a keep without windfall I mean I could keep this actually if he's playing red green or green or red I'm gonna be in laughing I'll keep in my opener not just keep these two as well so if he if he is if he's playing blue or yellow I won't bother playing him I'll just wait until he gets reduced or I get enough area from a windfall to play more efficiently come on Mountain yes that's exactly what we want to see all right Oh it's not fun so we are going to be the aggressors in this matchup because these plane burn you're just going to take double neutral this turn will take late explore leak and then we get those spots I was talking about in deck dr. and they're more aggressive lands then collect them might be a singer not just a man what's there oh hello lake and we'll pass so we can never have our comms activated really early now which is going to help I want to be able to play magnets quite early which is awesome so next turn I get explore Lake Magnus feels good and Archon make sure he can't escape I need Magnus here too so we can actually I can just play Magnus here that works and then I can play a song that is a sleep problem for him especially if I picked three more Magnus it's probably going to be instant surrender if I take the dream from Magnus so we played them down here just so is charged and get access to the rubble slinger that you know he can't wait he's actually running and rubble fling it into this guy because he knows that obviously Magnus is gonna be of a big problem I play the Lord of ten of Gera down okay now that's pretty pretty decent Seifer all right so he had a really decent response for that this lines a bit weird though just how awful this about huh very strange you beauty haha zero the zero cost failed experiment awesome we're going to failed experiment now I think into lossy sort of worth it now we'll find it next tune we don't need a cards right this moment we don't make their way to play them so we'll just hold on flame bursts alright magnet is gone he had a time he got me a zero carbs failed experiment feels good guys but my are contracted but that's that's the most important thing I have active archons now ooh windfall coming up alright we're going to failed experiment and yell or thief pick up pick the bra and the dream okay don't have much going on unfortunately I really wanted to get another Archon day start double collecting this spot for me Magda say why's she doing here so not too far from the dream if we pick up storm spawn going to be the pretty good spot Magda is a mono red burn is a bit weird because you don't make the lands you need to play the legendary card so we see a forest now so he has a green card so maybe Tara's harem eridan lots of different things that could be alright storm spawn you takes me up to 13 takes me up to 16 19 plus one so next to it now I'm going to gain 3 plus 1 into a rowers dream and that's when the nonsense is going to start poorest into tephra eridan ah I don't care Meredith engineer free free so how angry I am at this eridan I was expecting more he needs a movin to collect he's highlighting his own Magda this to Casa Petra would talk 8 night plus one and the dream the dream is real Arkham Baron and yaks all the fun stuff the yaks can kill this as you kill this with Aurora yeah okay we'll play yak so they collect a barrier for us here move here yeah we want our legs to be freed up I will put or down here I haven't finished come Magda yeah plate on creation one arc on make sure we get that I'm pretty vulnerable to firestorm now but the other icon if I get five stones I don't have a collector let's stick the Baron here let's stick an Archon here the science comes not like I mean by some kills all these guys but these will live and I'll get to push six next to him play a lake creation again and play another six six Lord of Tara okay don't worry care about him I was expecting firestorm so I wanted to have some board presence even after the firestorm because he's not going to favor to double firestorm because of these fire storms he doesn't play any creatures I can take him to turn to play another firestorm and by the time he's played that other firestorm I'll have a fresh are calm down which is gonna be hittin his orb alright frog Rifai I can storm spawn for morph area I want to take the aggressive lake I don't really need it though because I have this lake so I'll take the draw and that's top alright fragra fighters go to view move you up take let's take over the mountain let's pray these two off these guys up creation into Anna Boch on yeah I don't so we didn't even need a plan users stuff look look how easily you can flood the board once you get a dream off cypher [ __ ] all Fraga fine so he's just dead now well played shall we do it for funsies and these are on the Eurocopter so yeah here's a tip guys so aurorus a cost increase increases our creature to 2 bytes costs are a really bad way to explain that so yeah each creature will become a new creature that cop to more when you create an arc on their own e0 car so they become two - costs and that goes for anything new creation so keep that in mind when you're playing the card yeah frog Rifai move lake Leah hit it I'll do it for fun let's do it BAM oh my god did you fellas gonna die next - oh good oh goodness oh well it's still I still should be fun I thought the Scala - so there you go that's just the example of what will happen if you are or say all your outcomes that you've copied just don't do it it sometimes I did have a situation when I was first started playing is that where my only good line was really or or essay without drawing a card drawn the car could have given me some Rambler but I didn't want to you know gamble so yeah let's just just keep that in mind oh okay so let's put this into a more aggressive position in the storm we're going to use our to leave a coxcomb spawn so we gain 10 area take another lake copy of our say and let's transform Aurora say again number 2 [Music] there we have a little meatball yeah Errol sees a very fun card in the right situation well that wraps up this episode of deck pilot I hope you enjoyed it with a lot of fun especially the Aurora same nonsense I was able to pull off in the last match the deck will take some getting used to like I've said in my deck doctor and during the games as well but it's definitely worth it look at that last match is an example of why is worth getting rid of that deck if you like my video content be sure to subscribe to this youtube channel of course check out Viacom / the - hub for all my articles decks and guides thank you very much for watching again guys until next time take care have a great day", "vAXiH7SNr9Y": "[Music] welcome back ladies gentlemen boys and girls this is some of you see here doing a nother video episode of growing for freedom and in today's video episode guys we're gonna spend a little bit of time here just do a quick update from the epic for Kade looting bro the one in which we are trying to break our all-time record for this particular configuration and it has been a long time since we've grown blue dream but I think I've said this before in previous videos it's a very refreshing switch up from growing the sfb og I must say guys that it is much more rewarding to grow blue dream I know that the you know the herb that it creates obviously is not nearly as in-demand but from a pure growers perspective this is just an incredibly easy strain to work with it's just been an absolute dream you know it's the name I guess growing these plants it's been incredibly easy and right now we're kind of approaching not quite the halfway point I guess somewhere I think the halfway point is it to be closer towards the end of the month but you can obviously see at this point guys we have just a ton of blood development everywhere and although the canopy was looking somewhat sparse the plants being a bit vertical the filling has actually been going quite nicely since most of the areas are actually exactly how it would more or less want them to be but the exception to moving this little area right here you know I think that we could use maybe a couple folders to fill this space but other than that guys to grow over all it's actually quite well filled in and remember you know we are trying to grow more than just the ultra large close up top which there are plenty of obviously with being as vertical as they were but we also want to make sure that light does get down to knock out all these buds that we see here in this area between the four foot and the five foot level of the trellis and that's incredibly important guys because this stuff is going to make up you know you know a good amount of the overall yield so you want to make sure that light does get down here so this stuff does end up growing out really well I think you know that with the canopy being as it is we are gonna get a lot of great penetration so all we really gonna have to do coming up probably some point next week it's just to go down here and start just knocking out all this low stuff and then really get the plants efficient to get them to send all the resources exactly to the areas that we you know want to basically bulk up for the harvest and in regards to feeding again you know we're just sticking with the standard regimen I believe the last watering that we did was the diluted reservoirs so we do have fresh water here in the weights to give the plants another boost of full strength nutrients and we are going to get to you to feed the plants with big buds we don't generally kick over to overdrive nearly as quickly as we do with you know gene only because you know this strain here is slated or that I'm sorry this grow it's slated to go about 70 days which is general for the strain last time I believe we took it down at 69 days that was the multi strain girl which only had one blue drink plan I think it was either day 16 or 69 that we took that back garden down which is great for the OGS and pretty good for the Mendo a few but for the Blue Dream we want to make sure that we put in you know at least our our set 70 days our goal as far as other things to look at there might be a potential to maybe raise the lights just a little bit maybe I don't know it really depends a lot on the environmental factors we did have one somewhat warm day a couple of days ago that you know looked like it may have turned into somewhat a little bit of a heatwave but then they quickly got cool that night and the temperatures have been relatively mild ever since that if it continues to be that way then we'll probably grow lights where they are but if it doesn't get a little bit hotter than normal which it sometimes can do you know come July and August obviously then probably consider raising the lights up just a little bit to make sure that we don't put any undue stress you know in the heat variety on the plants because you know that of course could affect quality but if the temperatures stay this way obviously one thing the lights as close as possible to get the best density possible and the largest buds that we can only because you know this is not a stream that generally will identify you know quite as much as what we see from like the SF EOG but if we can you know keep the lights really close we can still get some pretty dense you know buds in regards to what we're used to seeing with blue dream and if you can get that with this strain as well as keeping all the other quality factors in check you know in regards to smell you know crystallization and you know overall form and obviously potency then you know we're gonna have a particularly epic grill here guys you know whether or not we break the record and we're definitely on pace to have you know one of the nicest buti'm groves we've had not only in a while but overall you know compared to the rest so we obviously just want to keep on Petes what we're doing not trying to change things up a bit and just let the environment dictate the minor changes we might have to make and come 70 days guys I think it's gonna be really great so that is pretty much it for this video update not gonna be able to do the live show tomorrow because I'm going to be tied up through the day it's funny because I actually had done a video update from the nursery from the the live plants specifically because I know you guys have pretty much gotten a pretty good update from all the production line cloning operations because of our time lapses but I didn't want to take the time to make a little bit of clone video but I shot on one of my older cameras and I was just not happy with the way the video looks it's amazing the difference is you know between how I used to do things and how I do them now so probably gonna have to reshoot that video we'll do that first before we hammer down a date for you know coming back to the live show but we will be doing it so in the meantime guys if you do have stuff that you want to have addressed in the live show email that directly to me at sub LBC Q&A at gmail.com and we will get that addressed when we do the next live show whenever that may be but till then guys probably going to do the next little cloning video update yeah actually actually I'm pretty sure that will be coming up next so stick around guys it'll be coming up tomorrow and then I will see you all next time oh and thanks a lot for watching by the way", "MEezCWODxs0": "hey what's up everybody Betty Crocker here this is day 14 of veg in my 4,000 watt blue dream flower room just want to give you guys another update as to what's going on in here first of all since my last video I haven't touched the plants at all I fed them really strong right all right after I made that video that was day 7 gave them a bunch of CNS 17 grow and a bunch of cal-mag actually gave them EC 1.8 I said I was gonna be like 1.6 but interviewing 1.8 and they took it just fine I did not water the fire oh geez that are in the back row though they they do not need water at that time and they're not deficient of nitrogen like the blue jeans are so they do not get water but now it's been seven days I haven't wanted anything yet actually yesterday I came in and there are like three plants that were starting to get light so I gave them just a little bit of plain water just to hold them over until today and I'm sure you can hear the water sloshing in the background that's my reservoir it is stirring up right now I'm gonna go ahead and feed the plants today just as soon as my pump which stirs my reservoir eats the water up enough right now it's about 57 degrees from the wait till I guess the 68 degrees then go ahead and water right now my pH is five point seven my EC is 1.8 and basically doing the same thing a bunch of CNS 17 grow and a bunch of Cal meg and that's it I think I did about 25 30 gallons or so worth of water and I did 450 milliliters of CNS 17 grow and then I think it took 200 milliliters of cal-mag in order to get up to that 1.8 work something something like that but anyway the plant side for the most part are greening up the ones that are directly under the light our little yellow scope from the light stress but besides that the plants are happy and green and I I know like every time I see the little girl blue dream they get the hot spots like right underneath the lights so I'm gonna try and get some super spreaders in here before flower or soon after because I know the blue dream can't him without really intense direct light but yeah the plants that aren't directly under the light are nice and green I see that one's pretty light green because it's rare Neath the lights in with that one but then back here these ones are nice and green again and I have the lights drop down on I'm pretty tight too anyway as far as lolli popping the topping I meant to do that it's gonna do it around 810 but I didn't get around to I just kinda let the plants push out and now that it's day 14 I've decided to go ahead and top everything and lollipop everything but I'm actually gonna wait a couple more days I decided I'm gonna veg for 21 days total so I'm gonna wait until probably day 17 16 or 17 and then come in here top all the plants lollipop all the plants let it veg for a few more days until day 21 and then at that point I will flip them into flower okay that's it for my veg 14 veg new 14 update guys so just to recap I haven't died anything in plants in seven days right now I'm going to feed them hard wait a few days cop lollipop and then I'll let them veg for another few days after that until day 21 then flip the lights okay I'll check back with you when I flip the lights peace", "ZIk3x6Hm2UA": "get engaged in my sugar little change when you place him and me pick out my boss I don't play and now I hesitate to enforce what I say run run on me

more song to sing she wrote a letter from blue water two days west of the marquesas said let the southern cross above you put the wind beneath your wings but me i'm just working by my phone whiskey and black coffee on my own [Music] and down in the city there's love and pity on my window the lights look like a sea of stars it wouldn't take one minute and i could be right in it by myself among the satellites and cars [Music] my friend writes of the mornings and of the silver summer sunsets of the faces in the water and of the kraken of the deep where the blue tones of the ocean meet the grays of the horizon where type circles like a vortex and there are no promises to keep quietly and safely in my home [Music] i carve out a nice existence on my own but down in the city wake love and pity from my window the lights look like a sea of stars it wouldn't take one minute and i could be right in it moving softly through the people and the cars but oh to see what there is to see [Music] know to breathe what there is to breathe and to feel what there is to feel and heal what there is to hear [Music] [Applause] as the early light is dawning and after all my time of silence i see the northern constellations and i hear my doorbells start to ring so this morning i just turned off my phone at 5am the cab will take me from my home down in the city i leave love and mini as i switch to riding airplanes from riding cars just a few more minutes but i will be right in it with my eyes upon [Music] you", "KP-_EfWkCKo": "hey everyone this is tech crazy today's video is going to be review for blue dream by station house um this is sativa it's a six pack of pre-rolls i got and uh very nice very nice daytime smoke a little bit expensive not too expensive nice size joints but i um have for me it's very smooth you kind of gotta wipe these joints or they'll canoe all over the place i think it tastes like blueberries smoke one of my favorites it also takes away all your pain so if you're doing computer working backings stuff like that this stream will help see it's canoeing it's good to wet the tip before you learn this one is like a mid-range price uh one and they're pre-rolled i think was 30 bucks i'm gonna give this one a 4.8 um i really like the effects i don't get too stoned from it i'm actually not very buzzed from it more or less it took away all my pain and helped me relax i put any information i can in the video i can't really tell you much more about it it's just pretty basic you", "NnedKiWs71U": "yo what's up Serpas squad Tanner here and I'm building another nano pallid areum this project is different though Rachael O'Leary asked me to participate in the scaping from scraps challenge where you have to escape exclusively with materials from around the house sure I do that all the time but I almost always buy an element or two to complete the build not for this one though let's scape from scraps I do little recap before we start back in August of 2019 I transform this 5.5 gallon all Keon aquarium into a rimless pallid areum style tank it was used to make the pond themed riparian which I think was a neat little project I'll link that video up in the card although I like that set up I recently came up with a better idea that I think will look incredible as such the ripe areum was taken apart and I saved the materials for other projects or this one before getting started I wanted to make a few modifications to the tank you'll notice I scraped up the viewing panel pretty badly I also think the silicon beads on the front or larger than they need to be to fix both of these issues I'll simply replace the front pane of glass to remove the existing one I'll use a razor scraper first I removed the seam on the inside of the tank it would have been nice to just remove the sections in the front but new silicon doesn't stick all the old silicon we need to redo the entire inside seam once that was removed I cut through the seam between the pieces and removed the glass let's cut out a new one for that I have a scrap piece with the broken edge which otherwise isn't good for much I also have a glass cutting wheel lubricating oil two rollers a spring clamp cut resistant gloves and safety glasses I set one of the rollers on the glass is the straight edge and made my measurements the edge closest to me was clamped down and I double-checked the measurements I old the cutting tool so it rolls easily and to keep the glass from fusing back together once it's scored it was first lightly rolled over the glass to distribute the oil then I applied even downward pressure with a single pass to create this scored line [Music] the glasses moved to the edge of the table and snapped along the scored line the one side didn't snap on the line but luckily I don't need the entire length of glass I repeated the process to get the glass down to the desired width before doing anything else I'll say in the edges with 150 grit sandpaper so it's safe to handle with bare hands I sprayed the sandpaper with water to eliminate dust particles and sand it away it doesn't take much just enough to remove the sharp edges with the edges buffed out I rinse the glass to remove any debris the end result was a clean piece of glass free of scratches ready to be attached to the tank prior to that I'll tape everything off with frog tape I added strips of tape to the newly cut piece and to the tank for consistent beads of silicone [Music] after that I poured isopropyl alcohol on a rag to clean the taped off areas this will remove debris in oils that could compromise the silicone seal as usual I'll use GE silicone wand to seal the tank this is a tube I've used previously I turned the tank on its back and applied silicone along the taped off areas then it was applied along the edges of the front and the new piece of glasses pressed in place it was also taped down I went around and smoothed the beats with my finger lastly I carefully removed the tape the tank was left to sit for 24 hours while the silicone cured after that the tank was turned upright the anchoring tape was removed and I scraped off any excess silicone now we have a pristine tank to work with since this will be a pallid areum you can imagine we need to move some water for that I'll use a spare mini 50 gallon per hour pump and a length of leftover 3/8 inch vinyl tubing with the addition of these items I also need to make a filter compartment of sorts for that I'll use the piece of glass we removed from the tank earlier I scraped off any remaining silicone and measured the tank I cut the piece to the appropriate height and then down the middle the end result being two pieces of glass that are the same height with one being slightly wider than the other I'm not stopping there though I also need to drill a few holes in the glass for that I have diamond tiptoe saws and duct seal putty I form the putty into a ring on the glass photo its water and drilled the holes I used the same paper from earlier for the edges a large hole was made for the intake of the pump and a small one for the return are you Scot knitting mesh to create a cover for the intake area I used two slightly larger hole saw to cut out a section I put silicone around the opening and press the mesh into it silicone was then applied to the edges of the glass the pieces were pressed into the tank since they're small the silicone is tacky enough to keep them situated I applied more silicone along the edges you won't see this area so it's fine if it looks a little sloppy this was also left to cure for 24 hours everything turned out nicely I put the pump down through the compartment I also want to create a buffer area between the scape in mesh screen for that I'll use a crate light diffuser held together with zip ties I cut down the egg crate with a pair of wire cutters once I had two smaller pieces they were joined with the zip ties to attach it to the tank I'll use hot glue the foam and other components will hold this in place so I'll use the glue to get a quick hold instead of waiting for silicone now we're ready to scape for hardscape I have sandstone River rocks and pine spider wood three of these came from the old Blue Dream shrimp tank I just had to scrape off all of the thread and superglue I used to hold Moss on the branches the others I had on deck for future build which ended up being this one to hold it on place I'll use great stuff gaps and cracks expanding foam this was one I used from the recent patio pond build luckily it had the reusable dispenser on it so I could get a second use out of it anyway I went on to scape the tank with the spider would I want this scape to have a lot of climbing areas for the shrimp with that mind I situated the branches so that all the roots will be in the water portion of the setup once I got a decent formation in place I turned the tank on its side from there I placed some of the larger stones between the branches and along the background these elements will act as a base for my scape I'm not concerned about details at this point I'm simply placing the largest elements with everything in place I applied foam between the objects to anchor at all I'll let the set up for a few hours prior to removing the excess once the foam cured I removed undesirable sections most of this I could do by hand but there were a few areas that called for the razor scraper now that the background is secured I want to give the waterfall a test run I filled the tank up and turned on the pump the vinyl tube was directed to various spots to determine where the waterfall would look best initially I intended for that to be on the far left of the setup but I later determined that it would look better on the right side of the glass compartment at first I tried to simply shorten the tube but I thought it would be hard to conceal later on and make it more difficult to service the pump if need be what I decided to do was make another hole for the returned in a better location for that I drilled like usual but I used two pressurized sprayer instead of putty in water luckily I was able to pull this off without ruining the entire setup I cut the tube once more and fed it through the new hole this should work perfectly now it's time to add more details to the background what I did was silicone various stones to the existing structure to hide off the phone my goal is to make it look like an eroded Bank of sorts most of the dirt has eroded away what's left are roots and stones I think that look was achieved quite well I let the silicone cure overnight the remainder of the glass above the waterline on the back of the tank needs to be concealed for that I'll use some scraps of cocoa fiber liner I simply lined the piece up with the shape of the rocks and gradually cut it down it ended up fitting perfectly I removed the liner applied silicone to the glass and pressed it in place I let this cure for a few hours prior to adding the final details to the background at this point it's almost ready to be planted I just have to finish off the background with some tree fern fibers I started by applying silicone between rocks and over the Coco fiber liner I firmly press the tree front into the silicone so that it's embedded into it otherwise the fibers just sit on the surface and generally fall out over as I worked through this I decided to cover off the cocoa fiber for consistent aesthetic once the main areas were addressed I went back with smaller bits of tree fern fibers and cyanoacrylate superglue I used these to fill in all the fine details I was very conscious of my application though as I had very little glue to work with to finalize the background I reattached a piece of wood that fell out earlier I also snipped off a piece of wood from another branch that looked out of place here's the end result I think it turned out extremely well and has a lot of great details and then gave the setup a quick rinse to remove debris while the tank was full I figured I would give the waterfall another test run it looked good but I adjusted a few rocks near the vinyl tube to optimize the flow that looks perfect after I drained the tank I placed rocks throughout the bottom I wanted to hide the egg crate area and add more definition to the layout now for the remainder of the materials for substrate I'm using a mix of planted tank substrates from an aquarium i dismantled not long ago peoples in garnets and I also have a few pieces of spider with twigs that came from the original pond themed riparian the majority of the plants I'm using came from the original setup including of course gramineae smitten miss aureus anubius nan Appetit rotala indica sigani and pata phylum white butterfly to lancia i Anantha in several miscellaneous plants I think are primarily different varieties in fall turn entre a few plants are also pulled from the bio orb including heavy grauffis or panda more coarse cominius minimis aureus in focus piola-kirchhoff olya I also got a few clippings of fotona Alba Venus mini white from the fire-bellied totalitarian cryptic corn 1t bronze from an old aquarium and a few boosts of flanger deep blue from the foggy riparian bowl as usual I'll start with the largest plant to Singhania I trimmed up the roots prior to planting to make things easier I put them in the set up before the substrates I can simply cover the roots in a moment trust me it's much easier that way after getting them situated in an area of interest I dumped in a few couples of the substrate mix it was distributed with a few brushes in doing so I wanted to cover the back two-thirds of the tank and the roots with that taken care of I could plant some more starting with the hemming office this is a great offset plan for the Cinco neum since the leaves are much finer it's also probably my favorite riparian plant next I watched the anubius rhizomes between a few of the river rocks the same was done with the ax course once those are situated I sprayed down the tank to keep things hydrated I also redistributed the plain to tank substrate from there I added more stones to the scape then I poured in the pea pebbles like the substrate from earlier they were distributed with the brush lastly the front of the scape was filled with the garnets and it's already damp so I can't distribute it well with a brush instead I sprayed it down to get it to settle with all of that looking proper I added the final pieces of driftwood although it's a different type of spider wood than the rest it blends in quite well now for the rest of the plants starting with the miscellaneous items next up were the stems of rotala indica I planted them primarily on the right side of the set up the boosts of Landrover wedged between the rocks just like the anubius and of course let's go above the rim and add the tillandsia to do so I simply super glued them to the branches this is a quick and easy solution that actually does quite well for the plants with the majority of things in place I filled up the tank to ensure nothing would float away lastly I planted the ficus on the background I didn't pin them in place or anything like that they'll root in over time the main thing with these is that a portion of their roots are submerged under water if you don't do this the plant will quickly wither away we're in the homestretch just a few minor things and it's done I taped a piece of black paper to the back of the tank to give the illusion that the background crevice keeps going beyond what you can see I also have some spare filter media for mechanical filtration in black lava rocks for additional surface area for beneficial bacteria after adding those the tank was finally returned to the nano shelf I filled it up with dechlorinated tap water no setup like this is complete without the floating plants I added something near minima duckweed and giant duckweed that were all pulled from various setups the combination of the three will create a great variation in texture before adding the inhabitants I got the tank going with Fritz I'm Tober start 700 which was provided by our channel sponsor we can't do this without some snails I've a few from the previous blue dream tank including a tiger narrate snail and olive narrates now and a few bladder snails there were some already living in the substrate so these are just a bonus I also decided to add some of the botanicals and leaf litter directly from the shrimp's previous tank hopefully these will help them feel at home right away lastly of course is a shrimp these are some of Lucas Brett's blue dream b-team shrimp I have a few more than this but these are all I could find in the tank for now they were trip acclimated prior to being added to the tank [Music] there you have it the new and improved Blue Dream shrimp pala Darian I think it's a really neat looking setup that truly shows how big you can go on such a small scale I tried to incorporate a lot of details and little textures that make this setup look bigger than it actually is I also kept the shrimp in mind throughout the entire build they'll make great use of all of the nooks crannies in different climbing areas something else I like is that the tank primarily uses earth tone colors which is what you'd see in nature there's a time and place for high contrast escapes but I honestly feel like they're a little outplayed typically I would only want to add shrimp stew awhile established setup I made an exception for this one though since the majority of materials came from season two aquariums and since we added bacteria the shrimp appear to like their new home so I think it will be just fine other than the snails nothing else will live in this tank this is a shrimp only scape and I think it showcases them perfectly I know that many were setting limitations on what they could do for the scaping from scraps challenge in addition to only using Scott materials I could have done that too but my goal is to make the best setups I possibly can therefore my only limitation was using items I already had at home I didn't want to make something just for the sake of making it I shouldn't needed a new home and I took the opportunity to make something for them within the confines of the challenge would you even know that was the case by looking at it though anyway I had an awesome time making this one and I'm so glad that I did be sure to check out the scrap scape hash tag to see what other creators are doing I'm curious to know what you thought of this one though how did I do with the scaping from scraps challenge anyway I really hope you enjoyed this one and learn something new if you did please take a moment to give the video a thumbs up it would mean a lot and helps out tremendously until next time surfer squad take care and peace [Music] [Music]", "aOmhikyB_Wk":

going to be talking about the history of cherry shrimp and we're going to be talking about everything from cherry red shrimp in the wild which doesn't exist exactly we have a rusty brick colored version and then we're going to be talking all the way about red Riley shrimp we're not going to be touching on too many of the color morphs but we're gonna follow that that line from the wild type all the way down to blue velvet blue dream and blue pearl and discuss a little bit about the difference because in order to understand the difference in the meaning behind blue dream blue velvet or blue pearl shrimp which there is a significant difference you must first understand the history behind these shrimp and why it is important not to mix them if you want to have a true line so first of all I want you to take a look at these shrimp and you can see how red we've gotten them to be so this is a painted fire shrimp in that it has a streak down its back that one may be Sakura fire but this red one on the right who's kicking all the babies off the rock would be considered the highest grade of today's red shrimp it has red antennas it has red legs and it is so dark that you cannot tell if it's pregnant or not you cannot see through it now if you look at the shrimp around it however they are much closer to native Neo caridina shrimp and they all originate from the Neo caridina Davey die branch hold on let me stabilize this while the tripod is getting stable so in the wild you had shrimp that looked something like this they were a brick red kind of muddy color and that's as close as a cherry shrimp that you were gonna get in the wild and in the 90s people started keeping these in aquariums as algae cleaners as just cleaners of detritus and things like that also more common was the Amano shrimp or the algae shrimp it had the name also known as that or the Japanese filter shrimp later on though by the late 90s there became more and more options in the market as science and people just talking and hobbyists began to get a hold of new and varied shrimp so the shrimp that also hit the market were from the caridina species and cherry shrimp are neo caridina David IgE is the name of their variation so caridina shrimp include tiger shrimp Taiwan B bolt shrimp and things like that variants of that you know there's all sorts of different ones now King Kong and so forth and those ones were being kept and experimented with at the same time in Taiwan Japan and Singapore in the mid to late 90s it wasn't until 2002 that they first hit the US as a as a commodity that had a distributor so these cherry shrimp and they were not read like this they were more of a they looked something more like that this one up here or this one back here they were more of a clear shrimp with some red stripes and it wasn't until later on the selective breeding allowed them to become what they are today so it's a relatively new development in the species that they exist so within the Oh caridina David I you had a dark color wild shrimp similar to say this fellow here and then you had a brick or rusty colored shrimp and then you had a black colored shrimp and all of these variants were kind of like saying everything's a domesticated dog or feel ice felis domesticus cat but you know one's a Persian and one is a tabby cat so they're just different color and style variations within the same species and they weren't even that extreme in in phenotype phenotype is what you call the expression of genes that are physically apparent so when you can see the difference that's the phenotype and the genotype is what is in there and so you may have these dark red shrimp but they produce these lighter red babies and that is the case and then you these babies will darken up they're very young but as they get older you'll find some of them are not of the same caliber as these adult shrimp in the tank and what we do then is called calling and so we pull those shrimp out now there's two kinds of calling essentially and I wanted to give big props to someone who's a big name in the shrimp world and that is Lucas Bret's at lrb aquatics he had a very elaborate system of calling he did not only pull the shrimp that were not red enough as some people would do but he took the shrimp that had other traits so for instance he noticed that some of the shrimp were clear in the center and some of those clear centered shrimp actually had blue spots or light blue in the center and so he put those in one tank and then he selected the ones that were most similar to those traits that he was looking for and through a series of a dozen or more tanks he would then separate these genes and after generation and generation of doing this and then pulling them out setting them aside pulling him out setting him aside and using a ton of Tanks he was able to get shrimp that are very very predictable and his shrimp are the blue strain that I still have today I love them they throw out only like 1 to 5 percent that are even not up to caliber which is a crazy rate for how consistent a gene light is so back to the history lesson a mono shrimp and tiger shrimp were also big in the market and it was just too hard to take care of those shrimp career average aquarium owner because you needed the ro/di or distilled water at different minerals and different diets and now they're becoming more popular again the last ten years and five especially but at the time a mono shrimp and these shrimp won out as the easiest care and by 2003 Petco and Petsmart started carrying cherry or red cherry shrimp and they kind of looked something like this baby they were translucent with the stripes and the next variant that breeders began to see in the u.s. was these type which are red really shrimp and they have a clear spot in their back now that clear spot this is all or this all originates from one of those three caridina neo caridina David I species and it is from the brick red rusty one that produced these so from here that turned blue and then after generations a dozen generations or more of that we were able or not me I didn't do all the work but people like Lucas and Miss jinx or Rachel O'Leary were able to get little blue shrimp such as this and more and more over time selecting for density of color and consistency of color as well as for other traits like size or patterns you also ended up with orange shrimp or tangerine shrimp you ended up with green jade shrimp the list goes on and on but what I wanted to explain to you is meanwhile in the u.s. we're playing with these shrimp and over in Asia China is beginning to breed them in mass as well as Thailand and Indonesia and they have perfected simply the dark red shrimp now I'm not saying that that's all they were doing there are plenty of hobbyists in Japan in Taiwan who were doing competitions and breeding many different shrimp and doing it in small containers oftentimes because the tradition of keeping koi was too hard as cities became more and more densely packed in urbanization takes hold so let's transition now and we're coming over here and I apologize for the wobbles but we're coming over here and we're looking at the grades of shrimp so from here you can see that those shrimp that I was talking about the the original three wild types neo caridina David I do caridina David I do cater David I here's the rusty one which then split into this family here is the darker brown one which led into Shoko or chocolate which also allowed Bloody Marys and even darker grade Bloody Marys to be created and then in the process when you mix these you end up with a blue diamond and that's a quirk of genetics so when you mix certain shrimp such as a blue a deep blue neon neo sorry neon or a chocolate you can end up with a crazy blue grade or you know there's just different combinations that happen that are unexpected it's not like mixing paints it's not red and blue is going to get you purple or even as simple as red and blue will get you a half red half blue shrimp so on the others part of the spectrum in this same family the other main player is the Neo caridina Pal Matta and that is where we get our white pearls our snowballs our Blue pearls and these are pretty close naturally to what they look like in that they're softer color and so they also end up producing some of the more jelly type blues as well as the path of noticing people like Lucas in the breeders out in Asia notice that you have red really shrimp right here and that clear spot is turning blue or they're getting blue dots and that's actually common in lobsters and other shellfish and crustaceans so it's not completely unheard of and geneticists and people with a slight background in that we're able to pick up on that and follow through with it so then you end up with a blue really or a mix and this isn't as straightforward as this chart which I've shown in other videos but then they bred that down into a blue jelly so that's a translucent that they've gotten the blue to spread and the red to dissipate in that same vein they also were able to get blue Velvets to develop so that is one course and then another course is the the chocolate shrimp also gave way to the blue velvet and this is of some debate some people have different ways of saying that this happened it seems to have happened in the early 2000s the first cases of it there were isolated cases of certain shrimp morphing and skipping some of these steps so to speak and turning straight from a cherry red into a mostly blue or clearish blue but to start getting them to predictably breed a certain way they followed this chart for the most part now there's a few updates we need to make to this chart and Lukas is actually the one who pointed that out to me but over here I wanted you to see how far we've come so this is 1997 1999 all the way up to 2001 or two and this is what you would buy all excited I remember that there is a red shrimp that's not a ghost shrimp it's clearish it's red and it's got little tiger stripes then they were able to grip to start breeding more and more red into it and more and more until even the legs and everything are red so that's just kind of you're working down the scale you've got a low-grade cherry shrimp you've got the sakura low-grade sometimes they say there's another grade of sakura or sakura fire and then you've got a high grade fire and then you've got painted fire or s grade or s s or double s grade or grade-a sakura it kind of depends on the system you're working with but what I wanted to explain is why you should not mix your blue shrimp that you get from different sources and why people like Miss jinx or Rachel O'Leary have been so adamant and outspoken about why it matters what we call our shrimp people like her and Lucas and hundreds or thousands of other hobbyists have taken you know it took Lucas dozens of tanks to be selectively breeding and not just throwing out the ones that weren't red enough but taking the ones that were blue just in case and putting them aside and then taking that ones with the blue spot and breeding them with other blue spots and then having two kinds from there and putting those in other tanks and then so on and so forth until he arrives at you know a carbon blue really or really shrimp however you want to say that word it means a clear shrimp with other spots so of color so the the greater or blackish type ends up making black rose or deep blue when bred selectively then into the carbon Raley's and then the carbon relays begin to have more clear spots and as I posted in my other video it turns out they also have a carbon really with a black black body and in gold stripes so that's probably what happened is one of my blue carbon relays or one of my blue Velvets reverted back in theory to one of these stages and then had the gene that caused this group this golden back so you can check that it out in other videos also go back and check out my history where I talk about all of these shrimp but basically what I wanted to show you was all the paths for these blues and why it matters what we're saying so even within neo caridina not even going into caridina you've got blue velvet which were bred over time and then you've got blue dream and then from there there's also blue topaz there's blue carbon really so some of them are blue shouldered and they're still a light blue then there's blue jelly there's opal blue or pearl blue and a lot of people have tried to change these names as a selling point but really it's important to know the lineage because when you're breeding shrimp you could have two blue Velvets and they have all the genes of their ancestors leading back to the wild and they can end up as far back as here but the more you bred them so like Lucas's breed super true and you get blue shrimp almost all the time and if they do throw an older variant it's usually just a light blue or something like that so his I believe and correct me if I'm wrong Lucas are from a red really with blue and then that blue was selected from over and over again or from a a really shrimp in any case and selected from so I just wanted to explain that to you guys and that the fact that these shrimp are still relatively new now there are 1500 species of freshwater shrimp that we have described and discovered and many of them already have brighter colors than these shrimp and so we are just scratching the surface the very tip of the iceberg of the potential shrimp that we could have in this hobby so I encourage you guys to check out other shrimp to look into the caridina shrimp but to look into things like bamboo shrimp or filter-feeding fan shrimp or the syllabus versions of the caridina shrimp such as the the green and yellow ones the black malawi shrimp there's all sorts of shrimp out there and i encourage you guys to look at him i hope this taught you a little something and entertained you for a while if you're breeding shrimp or just curious and if you want to learn more I have a whole playlist set up for that and if you stuck with me this long please like click thumbs up but I appreciate it and subscribe so you can check out more information coming up on this whole quality of nursery of shrimp and the system I use to breed up to eight different types in various tanks of at different times playing musical shrimp shuffling them around so thank you so much you guys it's great to talk to you it's a it's getting late for me but I just wanted to say thanks for sticking in take care of your fish take care of your shrimp and all your critters take care of business and each other and just keep swimming guys and have a good day I'll talk to you later this is Alex Williamson with the secret history living inside your aquarium take care guys"}
