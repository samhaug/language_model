{"J7VTY4i1cZc": "attention I want my videos to look like this and not like this so if you're under the age of 21 and don't have a medical marijuana card leave what's up everybody I'm back and I'm finally smoking again on the chanter finally willow Jays back and you guys I got a two and a half grand joint right here I'm just gonna sit down talk to you guys for a little bit about what happened this past week smoke this joint have a good time let's get a close-up on this joint real quick because I want to show you guys what's up with it let's get this sparked up Cheers [Music] [Music] Wow today I'm smoking on some lemon fire oh gee oh they should yummy all right you guys first up let's talk about why I haven't posted any videos in a while so as you guys know I am still a high schooler but I am 18 and I do have my med card but I'm in it or was in leadership at my high school and I made this channel they found out about the channel and they basically said if you make these videos you're gonna be kicked out of leadership and mr. cowboy so I private it all my videos tried to get back into mr. cowboy joining it back in the leadership and so they kind of said we have no legal right to kick you out of mr. cowboy because of what you do but I'm not gonna try anymore and I decided I want to pursue this channel more than I want to pursue leadership so basically channels back I'm out of leadership next try but that means I have more time for videos board time does about 2.5 grab joints but other than that I want to know if you guys want a tutorial on how to roll a joint cuz I know there are at least hundreds if not more join trolling tutorials on YouTube so I don't want to just be another creator that's like yours how to rule enjoy perfectly there you go give me some views I don't want to be like that but if you want to know how I roll my joints I will make a video because I do roll joints really weirdly I have this was a cone and I always roll my joints into cones but it [ __ ] burned so beautifully as you can see but yeah comment down below if you guys want to see me drop a tutorial on how I roll my joints this was actually my first ever to filter joint I've never wrote the to filter before I've only ever rolled a one filter but I wanted to try it out because I don't want to smoke skimpy joints on videos anymore I want to smoke big joints so as as this whole last week has gone down I've kind of come to the realization that this channel means a lot to me and I'm not doing this just to make money I'm not gonna make these videos just so I can get free weed I want to make these videos so you guys have a person to sesh with because when I was in 1617 it doesn't matter you if you're 18 19 20 21 above the age that it is legal to smoke [Music] how would you to watch this if you have no one to smoke with because you can smoke with me when I had no one to smoke with I turned on dopest yella I turned on Eric Colin and I watched them and that's what got me through my day and that basically is what I want to do for you guys I want to spread education about weed and about things close to weed and I also want to provide myself as a smoking buddy to all of you guys because I love my smoking buddies and without them I probably want to be smoking because this is not as fun to smoke on your own as it is to smoke with somebody and the only reason I do it is so I can do it on camera and then I can smoke with all you guys so it doesn't matter if you're ripping your joint your blunt your bong your pipe you're taking dad's you're ripping your cart as long as it's a disco card no cancer cards smoke along get high with me I'm I'm you're smoking buddy for the next ten minutes that's that's what you should be thinking this one goes out to dope is yellow into Eric Conn for being the two people that have literally got me through every shitty time I've ever been what day I've got to smoke with both of you guys I'm a smoky about let's get a couple hits in a row cuz I want to get through this this thing's a [ __ ] shocker alright another thing I've been thinking of merch do you guys want me to drop some merch because I've had ideas for it and I have some really good ideas for some merch but what's up to you guys so comment down below if you also want merch cuz I can do that isn't lemon tastes absolutely amazing outdoor just kicks so much different than Endor honestly comment below comment below how many times I've said comment below this video whoever gets it right gets to smoke my next joint with me [Music] [Music] challenge anybody who knows me that I go to school with or anything like that I if you just know me if you can roll a joint that is bigger and yummier than this and you smoke that with me I was shot you out on

__ ] heavy i'm like i feel like i'm holding a 10 pound weight it's not even that much well there i feel like that was a lot of water i'm used to like a smaller bong like my mouth on those i'm like my other one's a lot smaller than that like seriously like well oh but i like you you're so cute so much lighter i'm like holy [ __ ] i'm gonna oh my god i can't imagine breaking this this one was a lot more expensive than this too you wouldn't think all right huh i really like this bomb now like it's just it's big and it's just and not big this is supposedly average size my boyfriend's like that's regular size i'm like is it is this regulars well what's my size he's like man it's like small that's like considered small i was like what it's like i couldn't have i couldn't imagine having a large bob like that [ __ ] like do you know how like i was cleaning this because i couldn't fit it under the sink the [ __ ] bathtub my daughter's like what are you doing i'm like stay out of the bathroom together holy [ __ ] oh my god oh if i don't have coven now i'm about to get myself it oh [ __ ] meaning like someone in my daughter's class um tested positive so we're quarantining um that's what i was saying if i don't have it now me coughing like that it's literally from this oh my god oh people say something to me sometimes like if they smoke blunts and [ __ ] like that and they're just like well i don't like to smoke glass because i don't like to be blowing up and like coughing and [ __ ] like that i'm like i don't always cough like that like i do but blondes i felt like i cough like that too you know i feel like they even they do i'm like listen like if you call too much you know it's because it's like you took a big hit you know what i mean like that's usually what it is you took a big hit and that's better because you're going to be hot [Music] i'm sweating yeah i'm high why can't i i just know how much i can take in with like you know bombs and [ __ ] like that so i'm looking at this [ __ ] and i'm like i'm not blowing myself up i see what you're trying to do this [ __ ] this [ __ ] can get you i mean because this can fill up with a lot of smoke i hate when i pull the stem out with this [ __ ] always be like damn it oh my gosh and this lighting has to go yeah it says like it says like randy's i don't know who like i said i don't know who randy's is it says since 1975. i'm gonna name my bomb randy and be like come here randy come on cuz i'm gonna smoke mountain pong it's been like like it's been a couple weeks i [ __ ] love my bomb this one i mean i like my mini one this one is kind of like killing me a little bit i'm like oh but that may have been the moon rock i forgot i did smoke some people i know they'll say they'll just put the moon rock in a bowl and they won't even break it up they just leave it literally just like that in the bowl um they just keep sparking it and sparking it and just smoking smoke and smoking i haven't tried that yet honestly i feel like this is the best way i like it i like the black i mean this mouthpiece though like why are you so huge whatever i mean like you have to have a good grip on it this thing is like that thick you know what i mean like an awkward like i i can't even put my whole hand around it so i'm kind of like granted i guess this is what bogs are supposed to be like but i got so used to my mini one that i'm like whoa i like it a little too i like it i like that it's like bigger and cute 80 bucks 80 bucks that will that's what 80 bucks will get you i didn't want to get a new bong you know i was fine with the bong that i had but i couldn't find the stem and i didn't want to spend too much money because like the smoke shops they'll rob you like and i get my [ __ ] from there um but yeah i was like i'm not buying a bong from like a smoke shop but then my boyfriend ended up buying it and i was just like i get it like he's thinking like 80 bucks it's still you know it still seems good it still seems thick i don't know how thick this part is because you know when you blow this out it's the thickness of this you know what i mean so it's like is it this this you know thin like how thin is it you know so that's the only thing you don't know but i have a feeling that this is pretty thick all all around i like it though my boyfriend's bought like most of my class now so he just better know if we break up i'm taking all this class with me you're not doing that [ __ ] where you're like this is mine like no no like take this bong back i don't care actually i'm gonna buy myself a grab bomb that's what i want a grab bomb and they're not that much money really not so yeah so that was it that was it with randy randy my glass bong and i would say i'd say it's pretty good it's only it's just really heavy you know what i mean like it's just really really heavy um and i'm high i mean i'm high i feel good feel good definitely feel great so yeah and the moon rock that was a nice touch though i don't like call from my long up that like that's i bought two nuggets of wheat i mean i i oh two nuggets of moon rocks and that lasted me a little bit um i don't know i would say like probably not again unless someone else is like buying it like i just you know or they give it to me or they give it to me but um the moon knock i just don't see i don't see like why it's worth spending your money on like literally just get some dabs just get some wax to do that i'm going to spend your money on it it's just it's more of like a highway yeah you get you do get like more high but you're coughing a lot and you're just like [Music] you know it's not worth it it's not worth it get some wax do some dabs that's worth it like that's worth it so thank you guys for tuning in to

it'll be it'll be a lot dankier though and i mean it's still a lot weaker we've maybe smoked so it's still burning too like it's not going to go out anytime soon oh it's like one of them sacred rituals [ __ ] you know what i'm saying it's already pretty pretty lucky that we got to burn so well was expecting a few fails the only thing close to that is not having the torch at the beginning yes look at that are you feeling it are you feeling that oh yeah that hurt it looks like it don't let it fall it's intense it's getting so smoky in here guys holy [ __ ] just noticed it's like clouded as [ __ ] oh man do you all get this high i know we don't this often this shit's stupid i gotta get a video of me chief in this thing we have fun sunday driver is so good glad to have it yeehaw stanky oh

keep burning this i'm telling you you gotta just keep torching it yep that's what you gotta do that's the way you gotta have a torch on hand oh bro we're so [ __ ] so stressed out [ __ ] and we're about halfway i think this is halfway yeah i'd say halfway at least at least please for god's sake let it be over soon we smoked probably a quarter a quarter of it yeah that's a lot of weed i don't know how many times we're gonna have to cheat this until it's done how many hits of a supernatural does it take to get to the center of the filter right the world may never know i don't get this high ever ever bro man man this [ __ ] is becoming limp look at this it's a limp little piece yet shit's intense bro she's still tasty though like don't get us wrong like it's not even tasting bad at all i could put this out and probably hit it later i wanted to show you guys what sunday driver is real quick i'm just going to speak on it for just a moment because i did a twitch stream the strain sunday driver is an evenly balanced hybrid it's a 50 indica 50 sativa and it's crossed with fruity pebbles and grape pie i thought that [ __ ] great super crazy wow shout out we might end up having to try

appreciate everybody who's came around this year [ __ ] love you all for real this has been the dopest year ever i mean i know it's been a and it's been a rough year for a lot of people and it has for us too we've had our up and downs but it's kind of bittersweet even though it's been really is a little word for one of the worst times in the world it's still one of the best times to be alive if you

extraction in a nut smasher mini we're gonna do a seven gram extraction in the nuts master mini right now stick with me what we're going to do is we recommend to three and a half gram use in terms of bags for the nug smasher mini you can use a seven gram bag you can put up to seven grams of material in the mini using a seven gram bag remember it's increasing your surface area so you're going to have less pressure on the product which will give you a lower yield in some cases and a better quality result so you want to make sure that you can you can go ahead and lean down on the thing when you're using a seven gram because you are increasing the surface area it makes sense and i'll show you the difference between the two the seven and the three gram bag so you guys can see what the difference is in size that's a three and a half gram bag this is a seven gram bag so you can see the difference in size okay now just because we call it a three and a half gram bag you can put up to four or five sometimes even six grams in this bag depending on the density of the material and get a good extraction same pressure same consistency and should get the same yield because it's holding the same surface area so the key is the surface area hold with the bag now to get the surface area you got to make sure that you're tucking the bag and and packing it bottle tech style so we got lots of instruction on this lots of videos but basically the long short of it is that you turn the two corners inside out like that and then you put the material on top so which the result is you get a round round puck at the end that's a surface area that we've pre-measured to give you the right surface area to give you a good extraction like i said though this machine was made for this surface area so you can give it some extra pressure um you're not going to ruin the product when you're using a seven gram bag on a nug smasher mini okay so what we have here is we have two uh bags of material three and a half grams of piece so they're two eighths from a well-known grower we'll dump it out on the deal and load the bad guys smells good if you want to put the material in as even as possible you don't want to let any air leave any airy gaps you don't want to smash the [ __ ] out of it you don't want to ruin and smash the trikes into the actual plant material you just want to fill the void so you're going to get a nice round extraction you know the key is when it's extracting that you get a cylindrical down motion it doesn't lean to the side so it collapses on top of itself right like a slinky that makes sense so two three and a half gram bags here we'll shove in the seven so make seven grams keep it easy and simple any big stems like that you want to snap off you don't have to be overly picky with the stems but anything big that's hanging out at the base snap off [Music] okay now that we have the bag somewhat packed you can see how the bottom of the bag looks see how the corners are tucked in you got a round puck shape if one isn't tucked in quite enough you think you want to tuck it in a little bit more you can definitely take your time and do that i like to make sure that at least the tips are touching or they're overlapped that really makes sure that the surface area is exact every time once you do that you can just wrap the bat at the top of the bag up like a present tuck one side in the other side over itself this side right in now if there's a lot of excess bag you can definitely trim the bag off as well our bags are double backstitched all the way down the side they're made to be trimmed and not unraveled so you can definitely do that if you feel the need once you got it folded up on the top you lower the plates to the size of the actual bag that'll help you hold the parchment and everything in you can slide your parchment paper in let's talk a little bit about parchment paper i like to use i do not have a magnet i like to use um kirkland brand parchment paper it's uh it's you get it from costco you can order it online you get on amazon all over the place get it at costco um for 10 or 15 bucks um it'll you can go through 40 pounds or so so it's almost a lifetime supply two rolls so that's my recommendation don't use sheet paper the reason is the rosin soaks into the paper and you end up with a bunch of paper and rosin and it's just a mess so i've had rosin in this paper for years it's been solid hasn't dissolved into it it's great paper so all i know is what i know and it's good value too so but once you put the bag in there you can just start coming down evenly and like i said you want to make sure directly downward extraction on it and that the bag is tucking in just like a slinky you guys can see that make sure our release knob's completely tight and take your time with this you want to make sure that the heat is normalized through all the material and then go ahead and apply your pressure and then throughout the extraction we'll go ahead and once the material starts to come out and displace itself from the plates we'll go ahead and apply more pressure [Music] from the point that full pressure is applied you want to wait about 90 to 120 seconds so you can go to google play or the app store download nugsmasher.com's app we got a [ __ ] and timer on there we also got some uh calculator tools for the pro and the xp very handy tools you also have um your tert files that shows all kinds of different recipes and different strains that people are extracting all around the world so a lot of information there check that out go ahead download the nugsmasher app so i think we're about 30 seconds in we're about 40 through this extraction you can see it's starting to starting to run now the flower that i put in here i've had this flower 90 days i want to say 60 days 60 to 90 days so it's old flower i've kept it in the envelope with a bavita pack in it i'll show you what that looks like i like to use 75 percenters in arizona where i'm at because it's dry here so i use 75 humidity boveda they work great you can get them anywhere if you can't find 75 search for it it's it works if you can't get 75 72 is good in a pinch but if you're in a moist area don't use that much go to 69s or something and once you wait the full full time we'll go ahead and release pressure once you got that going and you can see it there's not a big run here this is all buttered up of course and that's how you want it i don't want to show you you want quality to come out of this thing and a collection plate works really good if you don't have a collection plate something else is really cold that retains it a piece of granite something like that work out okay for you so i'm gonna say you got about two grams of raw maybe 1.8 1.9 i'll show you guys this which everybody likes so what i'm doing is i'm cooling the plates down the collection plate's just sucking the heat out of them i'm just touching the plate with the collection plate so it works both ways gonna pull right off yeah so that helps you cool your plate down a lot quicker you know if you're trying to do something you can flip it on for a second to see where it's at so it cooled it down 25 degrees so far 20 degrees so it'll keep going it'll suck it out quick so how you can get a nice rosin coin is this needs to be you need to cool your plates off to about 100 degrees get your fresh piece of parchment everybody always asks right how they make the nice coins so separate your rosin onto a nice piece of parchment let your plates cool down like i said uh right at about 100 degrees no more than 110.

y'all watching me we don't have some work no smoking chill [Music] now [Music] it's my first one day to the other [Music]", "JqsAIe9NEHg": "[Music] [Music] guys welcome to the nut smasher smash lab corona california we're over here today we're going to do 21 grams and two 7 gram 90 micron nug smasher bags these right here and what we're going to do is we're going to do a bottle tech style and the nut smasher touch 206 degrees fahrenheit temperature we're going to do it at 700 material psi and we're going to set our surface area surface area pressure like i said at 2 7 gram nug smasher 90 micron bags so what we have here is the home screen on the nuggets master touch and this is mostly the screen that i use i mean and i do 99.9 of all my personal extractions on this exact machine you know it's been a progression of temperature and surface area calculations and this is the ultimate machine to do that with so anyhow but the main home screen gives you a surface area target so whatever my particular surface area target on the flower that i'm smashing or the hat you know whatever i'm what the material that i'm actually extracting you can put in here and quick and easy and you see what it is and then you can set the surface area down here by bag size so typically what i do for myself is i extract flour so when i extract flour and this is a flower setting i put flour in the nuge masher bags this extraction we're doing today i'm going to use seven gram bags that i'm gonna put ten and a half grams in each bag so we're gonna do a 21 gram extraction on the nug smasher touch in two with two seven gram bags and i'm gonna kind of show you guys how that works so we'll stop those little little you know right up to the the brim and we'll do an extraction here with it so what i did is i'm going to set the surface area for seven gram two bags that's the actual surface area size that i'm i'm actually going to be extracting it doesn't matter that i'm putting more than seven grams in each bag or it doesn't matter that i'm putting less than seven grams in each bag for instance i could put five grams in a seven gram bag and get very very close within a percentage of a percent the same exact yield out of my out of my product so really doesn't matter you have that flexibility it's a guideline on the bags to kind of give you what surface area you could set and you need to apply what pressure you need to apply to your actual extraction and that's kind of how that works surface area is going to be set for the two seven gram bags like i said the target temp um is or the target pressure set for 700 material psi now i like to come over here and put my time in i like to do a little longer than 90 seconds typically with a flower extraction your extraction's clean you don't typically burn it unless your heat's too high like i said 99 of the time i use this screen but if you are doing something different like if you are doing some thca isolation if you're using uh some extra micro on screen to do something i mean make some diamonds or whatever you're you're doing in this you can easily go from our bottle text style surface area calculation on this screen to a flat surface area so you can measure what you're putting in and give it the specific surface area and you know for for instance um you know a target material psi i was doing hash would be 400 right so i'd bring it to there and then i could put in here i could go flat and then i could go i have a one inch by 1.5 inch shape square that's my surface area and i'm going to achieve that 400 material psi and then i can add my timer here so this screen this you know we call it a master extractor screen it has more customization features so you can really get in there and do all kinds of different extractions and know exactly where you're at every time so you know on the thca you got to start with such a small surface area of pressure and you got to do it for such a long time it's crucial if you're doing an isolation or something like that with the with the unit so pretty neat feature and then up here you got the lights that turn just turn the lights on and off and then you got here the question mark gives you a help screen that just pulls up our contact information now we do have a customer service team that's there to answer any questions concerns help anybody with anything they may need seven days a week they're there from 7 a.m to 10 p.m pacific standard time and that's a tool for anybody any of our customers that need some help it's a lifeline that's always there if you get stuck with something or have a question or concern or something like that products are all lifetime warranty so keep that in mind really take that to heart i want to make sure everybody's having a great experience all the time so anyway that's a help screen you can get right to us on that and then over here is a setup screen this gives you your wi-fi connection if you're connected if you're not it tells you what version you're on uh tells you what the ip of the actual machine is you can restore reset the wi-fi and update your your current version from this screen here so anyway that's just a quick tour on the touch for this particular extraction we're just going back to the home screen we're going to go to 700 material psi we got our surface area set here right for that psi we're going to do it at 206 degrees for 120 seconds it's really that simple now all we do is tighten the release knob load our bags here and apply pressure so stay tuned we're going to load these bottle tech style that'll get ensure us the proper surface area size on all these putting the material in the bag you want to kind of evenly layer it you don't want to beat it up too bad so basically what we got here is we got two 90 micron seven gram bags with ten and a half grams in them we're gonna do a 21 gram extraction here on the next master touch okay now that we're all ready we got our heat plates all heated up we just confirmed that our surface area is set and it is to two seven gram bags surface area size now keep in mind there's 10 and a half grams in each bag that doesn't matter as long as our surface area is set to this particular size so that's what we're after we're our target psi is 700 we're gonna do it for 120 seconds and see if we can have an extraction all right once you got yourself a piece of parchment now in terms of parchment paper don't go with the generic stuff your product will merge with it i like costco brand the one from costco it's the kirkland brand or whatever but um it works for you know works really well if you're in a pinch get a rentals and rentals from the store just don't get the generic a walmart brand i hadn't seen people have real bad luck with it so nevertheless that's my parchment end so get a piece of parchment that fits in we're going to get these bags measured here you want to have the plates apart just about the size of the bag the height of the bag that's getting pretty close release knob tight get your bags folded over like a little present get your nose smasher magnet on there okay once you get your bag situated in there you can come on down and apply pressure nice and slow and easy you want all the pressure to normalize all through the material at the point that it reaches your total target psi here you'll see down here on the actual pressure the zero point you'll start to build once the material gets flat as you're coming down you want to make sure you get an accordion effect and you're coming down nice and straight your goal at the end is to have a nice round puck that's that size that's what determines the surface area so okay so the timer is going to start from the point that we reach full pressure and from that point you just kind of want to maintain right or right at that point because as the rosin comes off the plates pressure will go down because material is displaced you can see the timer starting to kick down so we just watch the timer come down maintain our pressure watch the plates fill up with goodness it's about halfway into our extraction here the yield looks nice but remember we got 21 grams of flour in there too so it should look nice you know yeah i don't want to see it all running i want to see this butter like that because that's right on the cusp that's right where i want to see it that means i don't my temp's not too high and i like to make sure it's just right at my target psi or a little above and we'll go ahead and take it off once the timer's done see what we ended up with so i'll go and collect this up we'll get a total weight see what our yield was on this all right guys so five and three quarter grams almost so 27 nug smasher touch you got two 7 gram 90 micron bags with products old flour it's been in bags it's just dispensary flour been in bags for um at least three months two months let's say to be fair put it at 700 material psi in those two 90 micron 7 gram bags for 120 seconds and what come out is five and three-quarters grams of solvent-less beautiful rosin that's what you get with the nut smasher touch hey thanks everybody for watching

fellows steven blair obviously it's me obviously it is me the one and only see that door over there and your knob if you're not 21 or older you should probably use that don't go this is a federally legal 100 hemp product it's been made legal since the 2018 passing of the farm bill we uh are gonna be doing something different um not quite the same as before but it will be a hemp product okay so i don't work for this company in fact uh i've gotten in contact with this company once or twice before and didn't have very good results in getting through to them to get a promo code or to get them to work in any way with dm blair so i'm not going to say that i dislike the company or have any problems with the company they just are not easy to get a hold of nor are they easy to work with c'est la vie but that doesn't mean they don't got good products it doesn't mean that they can't be reviewed and that they can't you know be part of the dm blair channel just not easy to get a hold of so start out i got this little pokey pokey thing from raw and this is the product here is that upside down nope that's right this is the product it's in a box made by nugsmasher it's called the nug packer okay enough with the jokes all right this is a serious issue and a serious product i hear you back there stop with the nug packer jokes all right so take this box and open the end i'll show you down in here that's what it looks like it's just right now nug packer hashtag nug packer blank space package so this thing is basically uh i take it it's a cone filler i mean one at a time so we're gonna work it out we're gonna see how it looks um i think there's some instructions in here here we go let me put on my glasses and i'll read for you i'll read for you what is on this piece of paper works with most cones up to 110 millimeters okay okay it's good to know drop cone into nut packer and make sure one make sure the cone is against the bottom of the nutcracker before we do this step two so i got some cones they're made by my favorite company they don't make them in black i don't see coons they're all black i wish they'd make them that way but i haven't seen them this has uh 32 cones in it all mushed inside of one another apparently and in layers they look sort of like that so let's see and this is why dm blair cannot have nice things she drops them and breaks them or loses them it's kind of plasticky or a papery tubie thing sorry for the odding guys it's pretty late here so we got the raw cone the raw [ __ ] like so where the [ __ ] did it go you know where it went in the nutcracker so we have our favorite herb here it's in the bag man can you tell me what's in the bag man i don't know but uh my suspicion is is if uh shaggy fred would have handed shaggy the baggie he'd have rolled scooby a doobie again if fred would have handed shaggy dub aggie keto rolled scooby adobe so basically we're going to take this stuff and we're going to put it in here i guess how i'm thinking it works so uh let's see it's in there now so let's just uh drop the material down in here now to get it see how it's kind of like bunched up there at the top i don't know if y'all can see that but to get it to go down and you just and it just kind of falls down in there okay like so and then later on it says that you're supposed to take a key and put it in from the bottom see the hole there shape like a key just kind of push it up and out like so oh my lord look at that look at that that is pretty sweet it's pretty sweet so now we just take this give it some final poundage put some topper on here like so and there we go well nub packer that is pretty sweet there it is nug packer bye nug smasher let's uh clean up our piece butter all right so let's say we like this and uh see how it smokes now i'm the type of person i cut oops i kind of push mine down and in the top instead of twisting it i don't like the twisty thing i kind of like to smash mine down in there i don't know i i feel that it kind of lights you more uniformly later down the line just going to take my handy dandy lighter here [Music] there we go that's pretty gnarly that's really nice that's really nice i have to say no packer you guys got it going on over there notes masher this thing was pretty cheap too i'll give you the uh i'll give you the um website info and uh i think there's even a phone number you can call that is really nice i like that that packed really well it's it's it's burning uniformly because it's got a really nice pack um you know it starts with the herbaceous material too that's pretty well ground up i use it for my uh that's actually the way that i use it for my uh herbal cigarette blend um if the video for that hasn't come out prior to this it will shortly after this i have a i have a whole bunch of videos in my library that have yet to be uploaded this is really nice and that was like 10 seconds not even i mean usually i got to fight with it and it punches up you got to pack it and then you got a fightless warrant that's pretty nice guys over there note smasher they're laughing all the way the bank got a bunch of other stuff i want to review here shortly something like this by raw they have like a [ __ ] six-shooter thing probably review that later uh plenty of help so we can make reviews i got plenty of products that we're gonna have to put a bunch of hemp in that'll be the supply to do so oh this thing's burning slow too i thought maybe i could smoke it into review but i think i'm probably just gonna have to let it go with this my suggestion is get you one of these little sticks they come with the uh raw um [ __ ] packer kit which i got the uh raw card as well in i know actually like 18 minutes went by here but it's like instantaneous to y'all when this son of a [ __ ] gets up to 88 miles an hour you're gonna see some serious [ __ ] [Music] actually yeah i didn't get up to 88 miles an hour but like it's instantaneous almost instantaneous i think the reason i'm hacking in coffin really is because the paper the roll like regular paper wide one and a quarter it's a little more bitter than the raw black paper plus i think the black paper is probably a little more thin not quite so meaty in the uh fibery area because that's uh one thing that i kind of pick up on with the papers is the fibers i have to do review of some papers i have a i have a couple different kinds of papers i've been sitting on that i want to do reviews of and do just like cigarette paper reviews and i have tons of blunt wraps i mean if i showed you all the blunt wraps i had you'd be like why aren't you smoking them it's like every store i go to and i don't know how i remember whether i do or don't have that i just go i don't have those like a thin paper like the last thing i want to use is like a top or a bugler that's like that's like taking a piece of paper out of your notebook anything misses the blue lines on this [ __ ] i like a slow burning thin paper so i can taste the herb the herbaceuticals you know i got another cool little toy today not sure if i want to stay up and review it or not because it takes a lot to it takes a lot of time to review this other product but i'm really excited about it it was uh it was something i saw on youtube surprisingly enough and was like i could figure out how to get one of those and so i got one the nug packer that's a completely different story nut smasher's got videos all over um i'd actually got this because i thought maybe i could use it to make a make a can of gar i don't know if you guys ever heard of a canadar if not i'll wait here you can go google it and then come back when you're done okay well if you're done googling that and you're back now can occurs are kind of like a cigar without like i don't know i don't think i don't think i would put a paper on my cangar or a leaf or a blunt wrap i don't know yet until i uh actually um to actually try it because i heard this is you keep like the little hole there you're supposed to be able to put a stick down and you put um parchment paper down in there and you put a stick in there and then you can pack the stuff around it which i guess you need a straw or something i don't know to a packet but uh i think that's i think that's a bit much to try and go through in honesty just enjoy a kindergarten man i'm trying like not to make a long video to smoke this but um tell you what guys i'll pause this one more time and uh i'll smoke the rest of there's pretty much a good listen and i'll let you know what i think here at the end whether or not nut packers you know this [ __ ] or just [ __ ] all right i'll be right back okay guys well it's been another 15 minutes or so and this thing oh he's knocking over every damn thing this thing's still burning ah thank you for stopping by please be safe be well be kind", "YZq6rUHGScE": "every one I've had this looks measuring now for a while now I realized I haven't got a review um pretty much everything except it you know so I thought it won't be a matter of time before I did a review on the next master email so you guys probably know what an ETL knows if you saw her email if you don't pretty much all it is is it's a simple what a pretty much metal piece that goes onto a metal slide which on top has a glass piece or some might be all metal and pretty much what it is it's just a bowl or sorry a nail for your fabric and then you'll take a little carb cap and go on top and pretty much what this does is instead of thinking in your torch to always heat it up you can send a certain temperature near like 600 degrees 700 degrees whatever you prefer and it will just keep it at that 24/7 so you take a dab and I'm like when you're taking a tap and temperature will go down the tab will stay at the same temperature throughout the whole DAP you might get a little bit cooler because you're putting air in there but that's just normal but uh if you don't know what a nino is that's pretty much what a nino is but the next not sure you know is super simple it's super small which I like because it actually comes with a soap carrying case you can see is pretty small like there's my hand for a size difference or there's um the tweezers I used to pull out the bags from the deluxe master so I don't get wax all over my hands but uh this uh this is it for a size comparison it's pretty small if it's that in there and then it has a different compartment for the email since this comes up in two different pieces this bottom part comes off this part here comes off this of course is part of the wire so that comes off and the part it's attached to here comes off so you can take this on and off and then this here as you can see has a little a little indent in there so you can take a screwdriver to it inter-site a software you can actually use your hands it's kind of hard with only one hand because one of my hands on the camera but you can slide this off and then it will act like a screw and then this middle or this class we'll come off sorry so you can replace your quartz balls and yeah that's pretty much that so those parts will come off in a fit in its own container here and then you're gonna have the this right here which is the little box and all this is is just a simple controller unit pretty much that will control the temperature and you can actually even um have a USB plugged into it and I like that because I'll just have this on my table and plug in my phone although I don't know if that's what it's made for but hey it's what I use it for then you just have the simple on/off switch which it won't do much if you don't have that played in will actually say error if you don't have anything plugged into it which is good because it obviously that's some sort of the indicator and I don't know that ill have that connected to it so we'll just stop waste your energy for no reason but yeah guys it's pretty much the review on the next semester you know remember if you want anything from the exposure from stickers to the bags the pressors coupon code yeah I'm stoned one word will save you a bunch of money on everything knife Smasher even though plates even though at all holders everything everything looks matter or even the you know coupon code yam stole and save you guys some money hey guys hope you enjoyed the little review have a good day guys peace", "OcHRzDQ9sHg": "yourself we - what something that goes out there I'm school from indigo TV and today got a nice little package from enough Smasher semi net with a goodie

yo it's a collection plate even have my face collection plate this is a it's made from Eric I think like t6 6061 aluminum aircraft aluminum so you know pretty much essentially what collection plate is is sometimes your when you press well usually do that don't have a rosin press and stuff like that you know like when I suppress with a flower in my wax make my shadow Mike I know my rosin will come out a little sappy on stuff like that so I would always need like something cold like an ice pack or something cool from the freezer to put it on so it started to pick it all up but with this you know this actually stays it stays pretty cool it's a collection plan no collection plate photos super sick right so awesome right here heavy damn peep this beautiful collections played by nut Smasher

dedicated to medical cannabis patients and adults 18 and older so hello everyone and thank you for joining me today today I'm celebrating 7 10 today's July 10th and a lot of people the dabbe know about the holiday known as 7/10 because it spells oil upside-down and concentrates it's a celebration of concentrates so here we go got my jab breakout it was a nice gift that was given to me by the Baked Alaska and sweet grant wells the Baked Alaska sent me the daybreak and I am sad to say that the the capper and this attachment thing he broke let me see if I could find the part that I can't it kept it as a souvenir as a thank-you but this part this part broke off and this is what I'm left with so this I've been using I'm going to use this to scoop up the dabs and put it into the banger well yeah and it's yeah exactly it happened in a total of two days the breaking of it yeah I feel bad about it I'm glad that I still have some remnants left of it but I went out and bought a capper for the dab rig so I'm gonna just like use this I've never used something well I used something like this before and let me tell you somebody broke that too I am not really good with glass so that's why I've been wrapping up the debris and all the accessories at night and maybe soaking like the banger and the wand thing in a solution of Dark Crystal that Dark Crystal cleaner and I've been doing that but one night I didn't I just didn't have left it out and it broke and I got up the next morning and I knocked it over and it broke with one of these it's a different story I was using it and I was so like what I'm not nervous at all I was using something that looked similar to this only the glass was the last Center and it broke because I couldn't get it in there I was trying to put it on here yeah and let it balance but it was so thin I mean that Stan was so flimsy I felt like the glass and I fell over and broke so it it is what it is but here we go long story all over what I'm gonna dab with is this live resin batter which is called forbidden fruit and I've got another one called ice cream cake so I'm gonna start with the forbidden fruit alright I hope you guys are doing good today I hope you're not stressing out over things you have no control over cuz you have no control over it so how can you stress over really that much just gotta let things turn out how they turn out so I'll show you what this looks like this what it looks like can't hear the sound I have some flute music I must have turned it down maybe the so here we go I'm gonna what I'd like to do is I'd like to put the concentrate on to the wine thing or whatever you want to call it first so that um by the time I get ready to dab and heated up the torch and the torch hasn't I mean the deputy banger hasn't cooled off so but with this just a lot more forgiving than the other dab rigs that I have that I want to use today so alright here we go I'm gonna fire it up choose everyone hope you're having an awesome 710 oh gosh some thought I should have put on a lighter shirt that was very good so yeah I'd like to heat up I like to eat up the dab room - oh I let it heat up for 45 seconds see the banger that's what I heated up for 45 seconds altogether and as soon as you get at the right temperature for me whoo yeah yeah I just I just pretty much heated up until it starts to glow specify orange that was something that um urban remo talked about was getting it orange hot you could even get it to a good goes ready - cuz right around then that that's when they if there's any residue on the inside it will start to start flaming up and they yeah that you're always good if you see that happening you're always good to go uh-huh I had seen some flame of mine once when I went to go dab with his right after someone else dab ha ha and there was still I concentrated in there so I guess I'm gonna do it still being in there so this is really good this strain as I said is cold what's it called forbidden fruit and 77 point 37 percent THC and CBD 0.1% this looks like here the packaging on it it has a warning label and everything like what's interesting though is hahaha there you see video yeah all right waiting bagging a CBD phone but people that really like CBD and they find it helpful that's cool so what I'm gonna do is I think I'm gonna switch rigs for the for the other portion of the dab video here so I'm gonna switch it up and use the ice cream cake starts train next so I'm gonna pause be back soon alright we're back so I've got the other dab rig it's pretty cool I'm not really loving the shape of the mouth part of it but whatever haha but I like this is pretty cool it's just another damn rig another style with the nail on it and then there's a cap where you cap it so what I'm gonna do first is I'm going to place the ice cream cake live resin batter on here first on my little wand here that's really a little wand it does have a fella yeah it's it's not my I mean yeah yeah so this is the ice cream cake batter and it is very good I've already had some I'm very very strong with this debri I find that I need to put the concentrate on to the wine before I heat it up with the torch the nail up with the torch because this cools off faster so that's one of the disadvantages of it yeah exactly because the shorter range it's alright Oh what I'll end up doing is probably getting a new wine I also have something else that I could have used to but I'm not seeing it oh here it is alright I could use this but this is the same length as the other it's cool yeah cuz it has a scooping little scooping part on there in the end so new s I'm gonna heat up the nail all right it's time time recap so I put the cap on top on there and then I picked it up and I put the dab in there and so ends another successful dab session all right so yeah thank you so much for joining me today for today's dab session if you guys are curious about dabbing and wondering if it'll help you in any way like if you have chronic pain if you have insomnia anxiety and poof that's all I need to say really happy 710 I did it I really tore me out guys whoo I am sweating so happy so attend a state chil don't watch the news 24/7 if you've been doing that maybe you should just not watch the news for a whole week this looks like a microphone the way it's posing right there [Applause] [Laughter] [Music] right now

commenting please tell me how you're doing today on this fine day of 710 and if you've never dad before feel free to peruse my past videos where I talk about dabbing my experience with dabbing and how it's helped so many people I mean some people can't some people can just get by with just smoking flour so it's just not strong enough so sometimes you have to have a little bit more and this is it already go stay chill and don't stress about [ __ ] you can't do anything about that's all I can say about that just be you don't be a sheep be you each person is an individual is an individual separate from the other person but not but not alienated or isolated yes separate different unique unique in their own essence that's right we've all come down here on a different mission and if we understand that then we understand world yeah all right brightest blessings y'all and I'll see you soon", "ScFCEIk1Cu8": "what up y'all it's your boy zmt back here with another video today we're smoking a blunt and it's not how ordinary blunt it's another whack blunt but a new flavor came out from Whitehall called black black berry mojito and yeah I wanted to roll a blunt but I also wanted some wax in it for you have some wax I don't know it really tastes too different and dad well you know put it in a blind make some longer and here's me rolling the blunt it's gonna be blunt wax video wax going crazy because I found a new flavor [Music] black berry mojito limited-edition I'm gonna put out a filter it in I usually cook these dude red dragon extracts that's what I'm using for the wax because I'm gonna wax this flim up before I roll some of the weed I have right here into it red dragon extracts it's a trim run so it's gonna put a bunch of it inside the blunt make it last longer let the weed last longer you taste the lead it's called a Tahoe og pretty dank as you can see that but let's see you alright y'all if you can see there there's a good amount of wax just all up in there I like a half gram because I had a full ground but I only took a few dabs out of it and now I'm left with this you but there it is y'all there's the blunt with the wax and the weed now I also got the black berry mojito limited edition with all this to see how this tastes go right outside check it out yeah the red dragon like strikes issue boy team to meet you guys outside now the plot which I always have in my beanie but let's get it your start lighting it up I like to like my monthly [Music] Oh [Music] I didn't like the way it tastes so I decided to stop thinking of it but also many feel real tired so I didn't if I felt like I couldn't sleep at night I was getting out of it it was trim run any other plant definitely not what I expected tastes that good of a taste almost like blood spatters obviously I'd rather snow a wagon blunt of that wax which I'm probably never gonna buy again this red dragon thing strikes I would get the live but don't get the trim line they probably just extremely probably just like very little but wrinkled but nice a lot longer it is just need essentially the wax makes my eyes my blonde last longer and the weed in the legs crazy the last time I ever get it from the leg out for me for extracts [Music] [Music] to the dome you saw right here it's your boy dmg like the video if you enjoyed it comment something down below something you enjoyed about

today we're gonna roll a blunt you're asking what haven't you already done that well today we're gonna roll the blunt and we're gonna cover it in some wax and then roll it in some Keef so I've got everything that I need of course my rap some dragon berry I've got my grinder which I've already grinded up some weed it's overflowing as you can see so I do expect this to be a pretty good sized blunt and then of course you got to have the Keef which I've got right there and then for wax I've got a couple of different options I've got some go berry flow and some durbin poison so I'm gonna get the blunt itself rolled and once I've got that done I'll be back to show you how to apply the wax and then the Keef all right I got my blood all rolled as usual it looks awesome of course they always do so now we're gonna do is take our wax and I'm going to take the Durbin poison I've got my little scooper right here watching a lot of videos and seeing pictures of everyone who does these swirls around their joints or their blunts and it looks all pretty I see if we can get ours to look anything like that I'm guessing not but let's see what we can do actually I'm surprised and how well that's printing you see that right there starting to come along all right let's see if we can keep this going spread this out up on the top a little bit more a little bit too much appearance that's not really possible you never have too much but we want to spread it out a little more evenly [Music] screwdriver and it reminds me of doing arts and crafts back in the day well of course that was way way back in the day but still fun at this age all right let's get a little bit more on here [Music] there is now we just need to apply the kief so I've got this glass bowl here I want to tilt this down a little bit so you know hopefully everybody can see what I'm doing and we'll get the key fright here and just sprinkle this on I got this pan line so that's good thing I don't lose any of his Keef got a nice encoded take a look at that that actually came out damn pretty good I'm a little bit impressed so you know what's next time to fire this thing up of course I'll save that for another video in
