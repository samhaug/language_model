guys i'm in the dispensary right now i'm gonna collect my dab pen i'm gonna collect some kush and i'm gonna show you a little bit of shots of the dispensary here today and i hope you enjoy this video because i'm not even allowed to have my camera inside the dispensary so i'm taking a huge risk right now and they might even kick me out so yeah here we go we just acquired some [ __ ] all right we just came back from the [ __ ] dispensary yes sir and they gave me a free smell proof baggie but today is not about the smell-proof baggie no sir today is all about the good supply pineapple express vape cartridge yes sir it's all about this baby right here so i'm gonna get to the review right here right now so i'm gonna open the seal up right here here we have the cannabis canadian seal um i think i'm gonna use a nice pen to open it up can't wait to taste this apparently apparently the guy at the dispensary told me this is the best tasting vape cart he's ever tasted so let's see if he's right let's see this is the best tasting vape cartridge out there and the child lock always gets me man child lock always gets me it's well made it's well made not even gonna lie a few moments later this child lock really got me right now like it really really got me [Music] god damn it bro here we [ __ ] go god damn [Music] here we are with pine apple express vape cartridge let's give it a nice close-up shot so i'm going to take off first seal here we are about the second seal come on [Music] man so if you don't know already pineapple express is a slightly sativa leaning dominant hybrid generally has a super good taste it doesn't have the best of the best of all highs it's widely famous for the movie pineapple express with joe rogan i mean uh seth rogen and james franco apparently it is the best tasting dab cartridge vape cartridge out there and i guess i have that good supply battery pack and a good supply pineapple express vape cartridge so without further ado let's taste pineapple express oh my god this tastes like the [ __ ] bomb man oh lord holy [ __ ] name man bro i swear to god if you give this to a child he would think this is like a smoking candy pen right this tastes like pineapple this [ __ ] tastes like actual dead ass pineapple i wouldn't have thought that it actually tastes like pineapple the clerk at the dispensary was not kidding like he was dead ass not kidding so i'll take a few more puffs damn damn i feel a body hot no wait hold up hold up hold up give me a sec give me a sec no i can feel the mind high right away like it's weird but i already feel it it's right up in my brain and just hit me directly and i don't know if that's because this is a dang ass deep cartridge but this [ __ ] got me really big really fast oh hold up wait a minute i'll show you what else they gave me at the dispensary so i was like the thousandth ten thousand whatever thousand customer at their [ __ ] store and they gave me one big ass six six foot long [ __ ] towel beach towel whatever i'm not too sure about the thc levels of it it has thc 796.89 milligrams per gram if somebody can translate that to me in percentages in the comments below that would be very very appreciated because i have no [ __ ] clue how to calculate this so is it so oh okay no no no no no no no need to give me the answer i found it i'm just [ __ ] [ __ ] right thc 796.89 milligrams per gram how much is a gram a gram is a hundred somethings right 100 milligrams i think so if i divide 796 by 100 it gives me 79.68 so there's about 80 percent thc in the pineapple express who said stoners are [ __ ] [ __ ] nobody i'm smart as [ __ ] [Music] so i think that's enough uh [ __ ] i think that's enough puffs for me today it got me pretty baked it got me pretty baked it gave me a nice smooth sativa high like i'm i'm kind of gigglish i'm not even gonna lie and like you know i feel like talking i feel like cracking up some shitty jokes you know i mean but i'ma keep it a buck with you i'm pretty pretty baked above all and it really helps it really hits well it has an amazing taste an amazing taste i might go as to say it's one of the best vape cartridges i've ever tasted but that's to say that's the good supply one i don't know if the other ones taste as good but this one was really well made it really tasted good compared to the like three four others i've tasted pretty good pretty solid so yeah that was pineapple express if you did enjoy this video then drop a like and hit that subscribe button this is tony robb you guys know the drill and i'm out", "qGjvbtb-XO0": "well Aloha brothers and sisters welcome back to the channel I'm so excited to have all you cannabis connoisseurs and enthusiasts with me today I have a classic strain in vape cartridge form for you today pineapple express baby coming at you from the good people a good supply this is a THC heavy vape cartridge coming in at seven hundred sixty four point one milligrams of THC less than five percent milligrams CBD today about seventy six percent THC in less than a percent CBD so as I said heavy-hitting hybrid THC cartridge coming at you from good supply I'm very excited to try this out pineapple Express is one of my favorite strains of all time probably one of yours too it's classic its legendary they make goddamn movie out of this thing one of my favorite movies probably one of your students hilarious I was very excited to see this in my own cannabis shop even more excited when I found out this thing's going for 40 bucks 40 bucks for a 0.5 gram 510 thread vape cartridge that's the best I've seen in the Canadian market personally so far so I snapped it up right away very excited to check you know he's gonna show you here on the side of the package I'll hold it up for the camera hopefully it doesn't bore but it does let me know what is let me let you know what it says it says our oil what's inside cannabis distillate plant-based terpenes no additives our product the cartridge premium ceramic or anti leaked technology direct airflow system you know I appreciate this kind of information being put on the package I like to know that it's plant-based terpenes not artificial I like to know that it's cannabis dislike to know what's in the cartoon you know more information is not a bad thing I would like to see some other companies follow suit on this good job good supply I like that so without further ado I'm gonna break the seal on this bad boy and figure out how to open it again you know it is some kind of heavy little feels thick cardboard packaging here feels a little wasteful but yeah it's a Canadian market let's open it looks like you pinch the sides and push yeah there we go so here comes the reveal for y'all and there we have it um it's nice-looking let's rescue it from this package yes some heavy thick heavy-duty cardboard packaging for a little item this has got to change um yeah this is a nice-looking cartridge let me hold it up for you all there oh it's got a nice metallic finish on it silver I see a THC logo there I know as it said pineapple Express on that green band and good supply I think at the bottom hopefully that's not blurry for you more importantly though I know it looks great check it out that oil is nice and clear it's a good color hopefully it's coming through clear for you because it looks clear and good that looks smokeable I'm excited that mouthpiece condom and rubber nub oh look we dropped it and yeah it's a nice looking cartridge let's get it on the old standard 510 battery here and the excitement grows as intensifies as we screw it on I'm really looking forward to this everybody I talk know it's tasty hmm yeah that's pretty good you know his little plug there but first John just came out of the package tastes really good kind of a citrusy sweet taste on the intake there and kind of held up on the way out mixed with a little bit of a herbalist herbally kind of taste there kind of herbal and citrusy sweet wouldn't necessarily say pineapple but let's check it out again yeah it's yummy man yep so sweet citrusy taste he definitely tastes that on when they first take a drink and then the exhale it definitely holds up and yeah it's kind of horrible I like it kind of tastes like smoking flower you know it's not too bad it's a good taste in the vape cartridge you know a little distracted here because I've noticed you know this is only 1/2 fault here it's kind of a big cartridge it's dawning on me here that this must be a 1 gram cartridge because it's a point 5 gram you know this lid in there they must be making one gram cartridges in the future that got me excited so yeah breaking news one gram cartridge is coming up looks like from a good supply but you know back to the flavor back to the taste this is pretty good to get a pretty good vapor I see it's not harsh pretty smooth yeah very good vapor production and yeah that's a good flavor I'm really good to enjoy vaping this over the next couple days and as always come back but you know what I think then all right so the final verdict on the old pineapple express some good supply here you know I've been vaping the hell out of this thing the last four days I've run a readout and tell you what I like he didn't like about it I liked a lot about it to be honest favorite thing about it was a taste flavor was great out of this world spine Apple Express baby from the first drag to the last flavor holds up never waned and never weak really good really strong you nailed a good supply you did a good job I can't always say that about all cartridges the flavor held up throughout the whole thing we really get and the flavor that was there really loved it I'm big fat it's pineapple Express it's great you're gonna love the taste the effects really nice effects you know it's a little milder than you might think at a 76 percent THC level so it's not a super heavy hitter you're not gonna get blitzed big stoned out of your mind but it's a good all day strain it's a great way can be extreme it's a sociable strain very conversational motivate you get through your day really happy up with the kind of feeling throughout your day that's a good strain you know what I mean I love it it's a good strain of having a pandemic you got to keep your chin up your spirits up there's a little tank of getting your spirits up that's for sure so you know I really enjoyed it's a little milder than some people might like but I thought it was great really good all day straight it's a hybrid strain I find it to be a lot more sativa meaning like I say it's all day long stream it's not going to let you know you're not gonna feel really tired it's not gonna burn you out really good strain three four hits on this thing lasts about an hour hour and a half before you kind of feel like you might want to have another pull fantastic good job good supply I really enjoyed it only downer to this thing oh you know another thing I really like is I like the look of this I mean look at that it's just nice right it's really shiny really metallic nice look I'm a sucker for a good look looks good but let's get into the only negative I have here well I got one small negative this little green band that you got down here kind of blocks how much oil you got left in the cartridge that's a bit of a bombing event it's alright it's not that big a deal the biggest deal that I have with this is it doesn't seem to last too long it's four days later in a mountain you know what I'm saying I mean like I noticed it moved around real easily in there it's kind of a thinner oil and a thinner oil is gonna vape alittle bit quicker so might want to take that into consideration with your value proposition with you know hey it's 40 bucks 4.5 grand cartridge but it doesn't seem to last that long I don't know personally I still recommend it it's alright I mean you know I was vaping it a lot you know not as much as I have other ones that have lasted longer but you know your mileage may vary out there as always but for what you get I recommend it I'd buy it again if I saw it in a store I'd buy it again I really liked it really impressed I enjoy the price enjoy the effects enjoy the taste I enjoy pineapple Express from good supply good job I liked it so hope you like the videos thanks for stopping by and watching I

that's been requested for review for a long time and i finally got around to it and i'm really glad i did today's reviews on the pineapple express 510 cartridge from good supply uh so i've reviewed uh something from good supply before i think was the blue dream so if you want to get a lot of information about good supply and their parent company aphria i'll refer you to that review but in short a good supply comes out of leamington ontario so close by to where i live in toronto ontario and canada and their licensed producer is a huge licensed producer here in canada called aphria and they turn out really good product good quality they have this sort of 509 process that i talked about in the other review um just making sure that the quality control is really high on it so enough about that let's get into some of the details about price and everything so on the ontario cannabis store this is actually on sale right now it's normally 43.95 and that's for how much is this one gram i believe uh 0.5 grams so that's for 0.5 grams but right now there's a price drop so uh go and grab it it's 39.95 right now so what that boils down to is six dollars fifty cents uh for every point one gram which puts it into i would say that's um that's on the lower end of um of price point for the 510 cartridges sort of low to medium end um so it's well priced now a little bit more about the actual oil in here it's sourced from a hybrid strain which is pineapple express so it's a hybrid um it contains 77 to 83 thc making it categorized as very strong and i'd agree with that um it's pretty much got zero to point eight percent cbd so there's not much cbd to speak of inside of this oil a few other things about the um just the write-up on this oil uh they talk a lot about the terpenes in here so uh it has well we'll get into flavor in a second but they say that it's got a smooth tropical flavor um the terpene profile includes things like limonene um which is sort of something you'll find having citrusy notes uh it's got um some mercene in there which has more of an earthy note it's got humulene again earthy notes lionel which has this sort of floral lavendary kind of note to it so there's a whole kind of mishmash of flavors going on in here and you end up getting a really pleasant tasting vapor okay pineapple express this taught me a really valuable lesson in terms of buying cannabis and especially trying out a lot of different products so this is case in point every person is an individual and every cannabis product because we're dealing with something that comes from a plant that has you know thousands of different chemical components to it is very individual and some people are going to respond to products uh differently than than others and it might take some time for you to figure out what product really gels with you and i'll tell you this product really gels with me and i'll tell you why so uh first off you know um why i didn't see it coming that i would like this product so much is that uh it's it's a pretty common product um and it's uh it's not an expensive product so um you know i just thought that it would probably be like most other uh cartridges that i tried but no it's very unique in how um and how it affects my body chemistry so uh let's uh let's open it up first uh so it comes in this great good supply box i really like the cool sort of green color of it i also like how it's a really sturdy feeling box it's not like flimsy paper like some of the other ones and it's got these really nice dense tabs that you can push in to release the inside of the box so i'll do that now so then the inside comes out and this is kind of the format of a lot of 510 cartridges and then your cartridge is in here pull that out uh i took off their ill come with like a little protector plastic protector on the bottom 510 thread and a protector on the top of the mouthpiece as well but i've removed those and it's got this nice sort of metallic mouthpiece that you know it feels quite heavy and sturdy and and it's got a nice sort of mouth feel to it too and then you just like all 510 cartridges rotate it right into your 510 battery so uh let's first talk about the flavor so i really liked how i think was one of um of my subscribers described it as sort of like a nice sweet tea flavor you know that's pretty accurate it kind of has this subtle sweet herbal flavor to it so i would say that i could pick up on any of the particular terpenes but they kind of all work together like the citrus the floral the earthy notes to kind of come together in this sort of sweet herbaly flavor it's not overpowering but you can definitely taste it and it doesn't really have a very cannabis-y flavor or scent to it unlike some of the other cartridges that that i reviewed recently like the um the green organic dutchman that you know that really kind of tastes like cannabis this has more of sort of like a florally sweet flavor to it so good flavor now uh effects so uh this one so i've been using this for probably about three weeks now so a little bit longer than some of the other cartridges that i've reviewed so i've really pinpointed the effects setting in at around 10 minutes so there's a bit of a lag between when you first take your puffs of the vaporizer to when you're really going to start to feel the effects it's about 10 minute lag there now the effects so this one has a real nice body effect to it and if you've watched my reviews that's that's what i like i like body effect i like relaxed muscles i like to feel the effects right through my whole body i don't really love those cartridges and those strains that are really sort of heady i like it when it's sort of more of a full body experience and pineapple express hit it right on the mark so who would have thought you know i've tried it's a hybrid i've tried a lot of indica strains a lot of sativa strains i've tried a lot of hybrid strains and really i can't think of any other cartridge that really gave me that body effect like this one that being said it's quite strong so i find that i need somewhere between one and maybe three but usually one really good sort of vape session and i had a um a previous post about how to vape properly so if you really give it a good vape one might be enough for you and it certainly is enough for me the majority of the time um so yeah so it's quite strong the effects last for uh quite you know a little bit longer than most other cartridges i would say around two hours maybe even two and a half hours i could still feel the effects from this one um and there's no like i don't get headaches really with this one there was the odd time that i would get a headache but um you know some other cartridges definitely it's like every time i get a headache with it um hasn't really been the case with this one you know i would say maybe 10 of the time um i get a little bit of a headache when i use this product but in general it's a really clean feeling it's got that great body effect i take this before bed it's really good to relax me and get ready for bed and you're not felt you don't feel really sort of sleepy and burnt out afterwards even um so like if you were using it not um not directly related to sleep you'd be okay i think um you wouldn't be too tired or sedated um with the use of this it's just a really relaxing product so yeah so that's really pineapple express in a nutshell this is definitely going to be one of my top three cartridges that i've reviewed and for that reason i'm giving this one a 10 out of 10. i really love it price is good flavor's on point it's got the effects that i really like so go out give it a try tell me what you guys think do you love it um did you think it was so so you know let me know let me know about the pineapple express and i'll be back with some more exciting reviews i've got some interviews with some shop owners coming up i got some more cannabis education so definitely stay tuned subscribe and i'll be back shortly", "fGwzqng9AOI": "[Music] hey guys dr. Shawn Mira VG here and it's time for another cannabis product review today I'm reviewing good Supply Blue Dream and this is a vape cartridge using the 510 system it's got a lot of good information even just on the box it says our oil what's inside cannabis distill a plant-based terpenes and the terpenes are quite nice in this one no additives which is what I like and premium ceramic core that sounds good anti leaked technology perfect don't want that leaking in direct airflow system alright so already I'm liking this product it's really kind of cool funky green color there's some good easy to read information on the box so this retails for $43 ninety five cents on the Ontario cannabis store it's got 75 to 83 percent THC meaning it's a quite a potent cannabis cartridge there's really no CBD in here it's a sativa dominant hybrid so a little bit about blue dream so blue dream is a really classic strain that originated in California it was made using two strains blueberry which is known for its sort of blueberry flavor owing to a sort of fruity terpene profile and a really classic sativa strain called haze it's so blue dream has been pretty much known for its sort of full body relaxing effects without being sedating now the licensed producer behind good supply is \u00e1free\u00e1 they're basically a giant here in Canada a huge licensed producer with a lot of brands under its name but good quality products I know a froyo well they're out of Leamington Ontario if anyone wanted to know and they pride themselves with this 509 step process which is basically just means there's they take five hundred and nine steps in they're sort of quality assurance program so everything's held up to a really big standard I guess 5:09 really doesn't mean much to the average person but I'm guessing if you went to their plant and they went through the whole system you'd be pretty impressed anyway so that's a little bit of the backstory about this so let's open it up I really like this box it's really cool so you open it up using these tabs so there's two tabs here so if you push them both in and then you can push the inside of the box out so really kind of sleek and cool and good child protective mechanism there and so your cartridge is inside here and you can just sort of bring it out and that's what it looks like it's got a nice heavy metal heavy metal alright a metal tip which you know it's got a good mouthfeel to it and of course just like all the other 5-10 oops 510 cartridges it fits into your battery just by turning it like this so there you go and then you're ready to go so about blue dream what really stands out about this particular product is the flavor so the flavor is very fruity notes forward it's very true to the blueberry ancestors of blue dream yeah probably one of the most fruity besides maybe the tangerine dream from San Rafael this would be the second most fruity vape I've tried now the effects pretty typical to a blue dream there's this sort of wave of kind of like hazy it just says the name suggests relaxation so I didn't feel particularly what should I say focused during the effects of this one it kind of makes your thinking a bit hazy and sloppy but at the same time it's very relaxing and other point to mention which I notice with this one is it's not sedating at all so I wouldn't recommend this for nighttime use cuz it might keep you up a bit unless you can augment it with something that's a little bit more sedating so yeah so that's pretty much it in a nutshell I'm gonna give this one hmm this is gonna be a tough one because I do like the flavour a lot I like the effects but I'm not crazy about the effects I'm gonna have to give this a seven and a half out of ten yeah a little bit shy of an eight just because the effects aren't my favorite and you know what it is is if I'm going to be taking a sativa that's not going to be sedating that you know is probably better for daytime use I want like I want to have a lot of focus a lot of energy I want to be able to get things done which is not really what this one brings to the table and maybe it's not what this one's designed for this one's really more about chilling and relaxing like during the daytime because it's not sedating but very relaxing so I think a seven and a half for me is fair some other people who want like a more chilled out experience will probably rate it a bit higher but that's what I'm going to give it all around a great product are really happy with the purchase oh yeah and I bought this from a new dispensary in my area of town called Miss Jones I want to just give them a shout out because the the store looks beautiful first of all and the staff was really friendly and I enjoyed talking with them so shout out to you guys at Miss Jones alright that's it for me I'll be back with another cannabis product review for you guys shortly", "yPGR0OavHVw": "[Music] [Applause] you this is the blue dream deep cartridge it's almost done now I do want to know that good supply is also an affray accompany so a freons like good supply is a Frias over the counter or recreational brand so a lot of the terpenes are very similar to the ones that they have all in there wait for the actual medical prescriptions which is kind of interesting but I do find this one works a little bit better ice it's similar to like a Churchill as far as I find it gives me an indica of fact it makes me sleepy I can't really focus very much this one's supposed to have a very flavor to it I don't really feel that it's very berry eat it is sweet though it does say on the profile for it or the description that it's supposed to be sweet flavored why do you find it is fairly sweet so I woke up from that one but overall it is good I actually have a migraine and will probably use this to take a nap this afternoon because I have a migraine and I'm going to try and get some rest in because there's a thunderstorm coming and hopefully it won't wreck my body completely so so I will use this to help me with sleep and nausea I will try to sleep it off this migraine so as far as what I use this again yes I would I would use this one again I even think I might like this one better then the \u00e1free\u00e1 better than the Africa cartridges or at least not all not all of them because I really really like the Aspen but as far as and I teach the potency one I think I like this one better than the one that you can get on the prescription five for sure [Music] [Applause]", "qL-WBjAQYjk": "[Music] hey [Music] what's going on guys tony robb here back from another youtube video i hope you guys are having an amazing day because mine is going amazing like every other day um if my voice and my articulation is a little messed up well that's because i just got my wisdom teeth removed a few hours ago like maybe a little over 10 hours ago and my mouth is a little bit swollen and that's not gonna stop me from making a youtube video and like i always do i push through and yeah so i hope you guys are going to enjoy this video because this is going to be a review yeah let's get it started all right what we have here today is a wax pen you know with cartridges thc and all that good stuff i didn't even open it i bought this from a local dispensary it's from the company good supply um this is a indica strain it has 880 808.76 milligrams of thc um there's a little bit less than five milligrams of cbd and a little less than a total of seven milligrams in the whole thing of cbd um it weighs about 0.5 grams it was packaged the 24th of march 2020 and yeah without further ado let's open up the packet and i was gonna use my mouth to open up this packet but i will not um yeah i can't wait to use this i bought it specifically because i was gonna get operated and i could not smoke and i know that vaping it isn't better than just regularly smoking it but i prefer to try to inhale the cleanest smoke possible so i don't get it infected some of my friends smoke backwards the day of their operation nothing happened but i prefer not to take the risk because i'm an unlucky person we have the good supply this pack cost me 58 it comes with the cartridge which is blue dream and it comes with the good supply vaporizer battery pack so it comes with included comes with a battery usb charger a usb chargeable it's 4 000 it's 400 milliamp hours three available temperatures standard 500 510 thread include yes and here it is yep this is what it looks like this is the packaging and this is what the thc box looks like so i'm gonna open it up and is this it um that's how you open up the box i don't feel like ruining the box wait oh okay i guess it opens up like this what is this right here like what does this do absolutely nothing okay okay so this whole box wow you could smell it through the cartridge that's sick damn smells like kind of smells actually the actual blue dream not even gonna lie with you about that so this is the cartridge this looks like a regular thc cartridge and we all know it's not fake so here we have the box and we have user instructions so i'll keep it here and i'll focus it and i'll read the instructions usage charge battery before use turn 510 threaded cartridge clockwise onto battery do not over tighten push button rapidly five times to turn on off led light will flash when batteries

have this baby right here so yeah my bad for the cut the audio software just stopped recording so i had to restart it but at least i got the supply pack charged so this comes with the battery pack right here this beautiful baby right here i charged it up you need to charge it before using it but at least the audio cutting helped me charge it up then you have the specific charger just like joule they're trying to make you not use a regular old charger they want you to use the specific charger you gotta screw it on and then you can charge it to tell if it is fully charged this thing is gonna turn green and this thing is gonna turn green so that's what happened it turned green and yeah i got it fully charged so without further ado let's uh get it started i'm gonna take one puff one puff only i'm not gonna puff it too much i'm not gonna start [ __ ] around with the smoke in my mouth because as i just said previously i just got my mouth operated so [ __ ] that i'm not gonna risk having an infection so yeah what we have here uh i need the instructions actually i'll keep the instructions in front of me so that way i don't mess up so here we have the pod the wax pod i'm gonna take off this cap right here come on baby yes sir got that cap off and let's screw it on they said not too tight it's not too tight and let's remove this over here and here we have it the blue dream distillate yes sir so with the blue dream this lit how do you turn it on push rapidly five times turn it on so one two three four five it's on no led will flash when batteries turn on press rapidly press button rapidly three times to alternate between three heating static settings one two three it just flashed blue uh one two three now it's red one two three now it's white okay um what are the colors like what's the the the you know the the chart the color chart um preheating rapidly twice okay one two so this is the preheating okay okay [ __ ] it so i'll take a puff okay that was one puff i'll take a second one hmm tasted actually fairly good didn't hurt too much my uh my molar my wisdom tooth area whatever so this thing actually gives me decent size drags actually wow and yeah so i'm gonna turn it off so i got my three four puffs in so another one last one all right so turn it off how do i turn it off press rapidly five times so one two three four five so is that it one two three four five one two three four five nothing i so i think it's off turn this off got the cartridge off so i had a little piece here i'll keep that protected and i'll put this on top of the cartridge so i can protect the cartridge and um i'll try to keep it standing up so i can prevent the hc from spilling over so my thoughts i can already feel the buzz coming in it's obviously a wax so it's a little stronger airflow was good it didn't feel like those cheap ass uh vapes has a good cartridge the battery is good the only downside i think is the charger the the screw-on charger i guess that's new i just lost the screw-on charger so you're pretty much screwed losing the screw-on charger if you lose it because um i don't know where the hell you can buy this except from a cannabis store or online on amazon but yeah make sure not to lose your screw-on charger make sure not to lose the cartridges the lady at the dispensary told me you can keep it pretty much anywhere in your pocket whatever i don't trust that hole so i'm gonna keep it somewhere warm and tidy so it doesn't melt or it does not uh lose its potency i'm gonna keep this somewhere safe too and overall good product seven out of ten if i would give it a number uh it was decently expensive the cartridges aren't expensive i think it's just the battery pack and the starter kit that's expensive um the vaporizer got me high i feel a little higher and a lot more elevated than i was a few mil a few moments ago obviously the whole product is good uh like i said seven out of ten pick it up if you want something discreet and that will let you get high on the low low um yeah that's pretty much it i don't have much to say about this product more than this gets you high gets the job done good ass blue dream i can't taste the blue dream that much and the high i guess reflects the blue dream high but not too much because it's a distillate in wax so it's a little stronger it's a sharper buzz but yeah if you guys enjoyed this

"hello ladies and gentlemen welcome back to weed stream it's myself here mr. matt CEO how's it going ladies and gentlemen just doing a little quick tutorial here so today we're looking at some new products that are on the market here and I'm not just meaning on the market but I'm meaning more or less inside of your dispensaries and your pot shops with that kind of stuff this kind of stuff I been kind of using in the past and I have been more switching to oils and vape just because I'm on the go more and like I said this kind of stuff is super super easy to use so I'm just gonna go over some stuff that here this um that you want if you see this kind of stuff get it I recommend it it's not the most expensive but it's a medium grade and they have newer stuff coming out in which I'm more interested in but like I said this is what I use and this is what I suggest because I find this to be the best so anyways this here is your straight straw it's your draw straw and this thing comes with a cool little charger that sticks into either your car or any USB outlet charging block I use it in my car i plug it into my into my USB port and it charges it in no time holds a really good charge glows cool red on the end it's a draw stick so it does not have any buttons which is one of my favorite things about it is it just instantly draws and yeah like I say it doesn't heat up it gets a little bit warm like every little stick does but it doesn't make it so hot and you want to have it a little bit warm anyways to kind of keep that oil coming down right you don't want it yeah you know what I mean if you use these so straight straws are good straight straws are not overly expensive and straight straws work for most and I'll get into what they don't work for but anyways they are very good with good supply and good supply is one of my favorite brands I don't know if you guys agree with me or not but good supply I like for their sativas I don't really take them for their indicas but there's sativas are usually fairly goodly priced this one here I believe was like $40 for 0.5 and like I said will go down it's a pretty good THC value we're sitting see we're gonna move that decimal point one point to the left so we are sitting at seventy five point two percent so about seventy five point three and our CBD well as you can see we don't even have a trace of CBD in there so we're looking at pure oil and these people use nothing while all oil companies that deal with extract distillate or honey oils they don't use no vitamin ease they don't use none of that stuff that is inside of your vapes that are in your store for tobacco companies like I said it's it's clean oil I've been smoking it most of the day today and I was a little bit grumpy when I woke up today but now I'm not so that tells you right there that this kind of stuff so I'm just gonna try and do this here with one hand which is kind of difficult let's see here sorry everybody I gotta get a better set up for this one of these days so as you can see your pen just slides on or sorry your cartridge just slides on to your pen just screws in five to ten thread everybody write five to ten thread make sure you say that to them or they say that to you in some form because that is exactly what what's going to get what you want to fit your your cartridges right so we'll just take it up here you can see you get a real nice draw from it it looks real nice you know what I mean you can clean it you can disinfect it you know I like this oil specifically because it's not a thick oil it's a nice honey oil you don't get that big blobs of bubbles in there and lose a lot of the oil up on the sides you have to heat it up and stuff so it's a real nice super good smoke this one here is pineapple express and I recommend pineapple express to people that are dealing with anxiety if you're pissed off if something's bothering you this kind of stuff it's got a lot of limonene in it and limonene is the turpentine or the terpene sorry that gets you nice and relaxed and happy you're gonna want to take this one if you're a little bit grumpy a little bit upset a little bit stressful in the day it's gonna make you feel energized to give you a little bit of that I don't give a [ __ ] type of attitude while you're inside and nice and happy so I would recommend this and like I say I

here are the top eight most expensive fruits in the world number eight Buddha shaped pairs the Buddha shaped pair is perhaps the most unique looking fruit on earth right down to the facial details these pears look exactly like little Buddha figurines since the dawn of Agriculture humans have been experimenting with their fruits and vegetables at first the goal was to create bigger faster growing food and in large quantities humans also have a history of manipulating the appearance of produce long before the arrival of Columbus to the Americas prehistoric farmers had developed hundreds of colorful and flashy varieties of corn beans tomatoes and peppers as people continued experimenting with the looks of their fruits and vegetables some were deemed more attractive than others it's estimated that around 40% of produce is rejected due to its appearance sadly most of these cold items are perfectly edible and nutritious and they just get thrown away the Buddha pear is grown by China's fruit mold company which is responsible for several other oddly shaped fruits including star-shaped cucumbers heart-shaped watermelons peaches shaped like human behinds and apples with gnome-like faces during immaturity these fruits along with the Buddha pear are tucked into the appropriate molds for their intended appearances the fruits fill the mold and simply adjust to its shape in 2009 one Buddha pear cost around 7.30 two cents these days they're a bit more reasonably priced at least in the Netherlands where tan Buddha pears can be purchased for 33 dollars and 89 cents what a steal number 7 Seki ie Qi apples in English Seki ie Qi means world's number one Secchia eg apples originated in Morioka Japan in 1978 and are still primarily grown in Japan they are round in shape and are one of the largest apples in the world weighing up to 2 pounds each and are a cross between Red Delicious and Golden Delicious apples those are two of my favorites to reach their huge size they require a bit of extra attention during the growing season Seki ihe apples are customarily eaten fresh rather than used for baking or cooking they have a mild but sweet flavor with minimal tartness just one sec eie chee apple typically costs around twenty one dollars they are sold throughout the fall and early winter I'm gonna be looking for one of those number six B Jin hime strawberries luxury fruit is popular in Japan because it connotates social status and is tied to cultural practices in an interview with CNN soy young Jim Dean of the school of human ecology at the University of wisconsin-madison explained that fruit plays an important role in Japanese gift-giving practices it's only natural then that Japan is home to some of the world's most expensive luxury fruits the country is reputed for carrying the world's most beautiful strawberries they're called B Jin hime which means beautiful princess and have been grown at the okuda farm for the past 35 years the farm belongs to O Kootenai Show who has spent decades perfecting his strawberries in an interview with CNN he explained that it took him 15 years to achieve the perfect be Jin hime strawberries which are scoop shaped and grow as big as a tennis ball neasha won't go into detail about his methods for growing these plump juicy strawberries and for good reason the average price of a tennis ball sized B Jin hime strawberry is four thousand three hundred and ninety-five dollars he only sells about 500 of them per year but to the mat that's still a lot of money and now for number five but first what's the most you're willing to pay for say a pineapple let me know in the comments below and be sure to subscribe to world list before you go anywhere number five dense ook watermelon the ultra rare dense ook watermelon is black skinned and stripeless and its flesh is known for being sweeter than other watermelon varieties they're grown on Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido only 100 are produced annually the average price for a dense ook watermelon is around 250 dollars but the highest-quality melons which are sold at auction typically sell for a thousand to four thousand five hundred dollars the most expensive one ever sold went for six thousand one hundred dollars at a 2008 auction and weights 17 pounds in 2014 staff members of the Canadian newspaper the star took a blind taste test of the dense ook watermelon some of the taste testers found the dense ook watermelon to be sweeter than a run-of-the-mill 699 watermelon from the market on the other hand some of the testers preferred the cheaper watermelon because it was less soggy than the expensive dense ook variety square watermelons which also originated from Japan can also cost several hundred dollars while dropping this kind of money for upscale fruit may be customary in Japan the practice is viewed less favorable among Ontarians mike chrome jack who's a partner at a Tilson Burgh Ontario watermelon and asparagus farm explained to the star that he wouldn't feel right selling a designer watermelon to someone for more than a few dollars because until it's cut in two there's no true way of knowing if it's ready to eat he also referred to the fancy watermelons as a status symbol and excess indulgence what about you would you pay an exorbitant price for any of the high-end fruits that we've talked about so far in today's video let me know in the comments below number four rwby roman grapes Ruby Roman grapes are grown exclusively in Japan's Ishikawa Prefecture each grape is around the size of a ping-pong ball and has a distinctive red shape there are strict rules for selling the Ruby Roman grapes each grape is inspected and must weigh at least 20 kilograms and have a sugar content of 18% or more there's also a premium class of Ruby Roman grape which requires each grape to weigh at least 30 kilograms and each bunch of grapes to weigh at least 700 kilograms in 2010 only six grapes were classified as premium and in 2011 zero grapes made the cut the first Ruby Roman grapes sold for nine hundred and ten dollars per bunch in 2008 or roughly twenty six dollars per grape in 2016 at the year's first auction at a wholesale market in Kanazawa a bunch of Ruby Roman grapes sold for around eight thousand four hundred dollars double-checked the kilograms it's like really heavy number three say Toni's cheeky cherries these bauble shaped shiny cherries are primary cultivated in Yamagata prefecture of Japan where 70% of the nation's cherries are grown when fully ripe these small cherries are bright red they're in season during early summer and are carefully sorted and graded like all Japanese fruit the say Tony cheeky cherry was first bred during the early 20th century by a farmer in dis uke Sato at the time most cherries went bad shortly after being picked or during shipping net a host of other issues Sato solved this problem by crossbreeding Tobi's cherries which have a short shelf life but a good flavor with Napoleon cherries which last much longer but have a sour taste it took him 16 years but eventually he came up with the say Tony cheeky cherry in 2018 a stolen batch of cherries weighing a hundred kilograms was valued at 5600 $31.24 number to deck upon the deco pond is a hybrid between a Mandarin and an orange and it's rumored to be the most delectable citrus fruit on earth now I have to try one it looks like an orange but is larger and sweeter and has a bump on the top a single piece of the seedless thick-skinned fruit can weigh up to a pound and its flavour is said to resemble that of an intense orange but a much sweeter in fact the deco ponds flavor is so sweet some have compared it to eating candy I really want a dry one the deco pond is a relatively new fruit it was first produced in 1972 by a governmental Research Station nagasaki prefecture japan it's now grown in various countries including Brazil and South Korea in 2011 the deco pond was harvested for the first time in the United States in California that same year in an article for the LA Times writer David Karp whose tried over 1,000 varieties of citrus identified the deco pond as the most delicious he's ever tasted by the 1990s Japanese consumers were paying as much as 10 dollars a piece for the deco pond as of early 2017 the average price of a six pack of deco ponds was eighty dollars number one lost gardens of Heligan pineapple in the county of Cornwall in southwestern England there's the lost gardens of Heligan a set of botanical gardens where pineapples are grown far outside of their traditional environment pineapples are a tropical fruit that don't grow naturally in England's temperate maritime climate in 1991 a manure heated pineapple pit was unearthed at the present-day location of the lost gardens of Heligan it's believed to be Britain's only working manure heated pineapple pit after many months of research architectural and horticultural historians concluded that the site's first structure was probably constructed during the 18th century the first pineapple flower bud was observed after three years of nurturing a plot in June 1997 Prince Charles visited the garden and in October of that year the first successful harvest occurred the growers even sampled the first pineapple to ensure it didn't taste like manure upon discovering that he was delicious they gave the second pineapple to queen elizabeth ii as a gift for her 50th wedding anniversary you know growing these pineapples is a very labor-intensive task and it can take years before any success is achieved after factoring together all the costs associated with growing the pineapples the growers determined that each pineapple has probably cost them in excessive get this 1290 $9.50 the growers don't sell their pineapples but instead share them among staff is a reward for their hard work throughout the growing process on the official website for the lost gardens of Heligan the cultivators of the pineapples state that it would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for someone to try one and that if one of their pineapples went up for auction $12,995 would be an appropriate selling price and thanks for watching which one of these very expensive fruits would you most like to try have you ever tasted any of them I think I want to try the deck upon you let me

it's kind of candied slush fresh yeah it is but I say it's very very much like the great bait like I thought but it's got a little bit of mint like a little bit of that cool adage it's not as much do you get the mint or not I get more layered together I get more women in the last one dear I'm not sure simile oh but that wouldn't make sense it's wrong it should be because I'm getting a less mint in this but I got moment last one so this is this is going back to what I've said in a few comments to reply to some of the viewers flavor can differentiate on your taste buds yeah so that's why I Liam's in so we can do this different devices and give different tanks different mods different powers so obviously I've got this at 50 watts a yahren 80 I've got a point one one coil in this it can go up

the berries you get a sweet naught of means that same sort of like Malaysian like plasticy sweet is nice it's like the sound appealing plan available well like with the last one that was the flip Rob off the last one wicked his wicked his was a mix of black currant and lemonade that creates an incredibly extraordinary exhale taste lemonade layer is perfectly blended without overdoing a crit and heavenly feel okay where's that one gone alright okay that's what that's slightly bitterness what you mentioned that makes that mix that makes a lot of sense then that little someone as you mentioned

from it the first one what with more berries enough it might be a very mix yeah Lightroom yeah I do like this the aluminium bottle this him to here who's fresh okay say it first look at the bottles like back is only 50 bills but it's a lot fill material all of 60 mils they don't look big enough yeah it's a very very thin material the aluminium that's what the bowlers bends it Wow I thought one of me that's definitely berries that's pre so I'm reading the M I'm very sweet berries you just make a point but very very good any Liam boy the description of this I was correct it is similar the very first ones blackcurrant so this one let's get someone down a bit you want to read it I may read it if my dyslexia doesn't kick into place yeah supers are we very funny so glad but they're in bad luck without bad blood on it a blood so bad blood is a nasty juice is an e liquid from the brands fruity series this scenery liquid combines of freshly picked black currants it tastes like currants little bit marries miss of them that is very burst with flavor and sprinkles them with a cool mint leaving you're refreshed and waiting for more so yeah I'm definitely getting the berries like with the other ones but a lot sweeter this time last week that I think that's the law mint because I don't get cool ardor I don't get anything called on mental or minty but I do get at the very end yeah that's kind of from the exhale yeah the end of the exhale and just just at the end yeah you correct there you're right for once a lot agree about it for that no real fun great yeah that's them like that almost tastes like a gummy candy yeah like the purple it's a hurry on a phase power boilers no I'm not a boy one no wait for it Delta is pop of islets and take them that would sweat and samantha is infused with everything together wait for it there's a subtle Palmer while I'm waiting for him I don't think those guys it's been fun events were an inner third juice oh well I put even so and I get wait what you mean by the palm of violets pork all it tastes like is very BORSTAR mix yes and you getting the white gummy shoes with the white gummy bottom in the plastic colored tire it is at the purple one of them yeah no yeah I don't get Palmer violins I know you mean it's similar but I get the poor purple shoes from the horrible stomachs for sure purple shoes that's that's tasty I like that one I feel I probably could get sick after a while really have too much I'll see ya like sweetest of me but yeah I'm more as a person and it's we aren't ready yet stick up there's always I love does real flavors because they're all like yeah and you know you get more out with them yeah but it's nice to have a fruit you make a fruit you flavor a review and to actually use for a bit yeah that a mix it up a bit because I'd mix up would like to get very strong and you know so but yeah I like that one I'm gonna have to quickly tick some work out and rework this for the next one because I've got to share the next two months you know always liquids definitely more flux like a service oh yeah all day like when we got fire engine their star yeah a neon green slushie so about over somewhere would have been read up in the called VIP it was heaven Loretta and it was quite warm some days you know with winder in the Northland yeah I the winter's coming yeah but yeah but now neat lime slushies come dunks typical that people don't want to vape them but I can see people enjoying these just because the fruits are in it and everything else so what's the next one next one we have by Devils Keith ah both both ungenerous ah it's a flavor I don't like this certain flavor but I'm still gonna read Wiccan I'm just gonna try and bear with me I might just have to cook this but out while I do my fair way for there with bear with where's the bear man BRB you've got a cut in your hair I've never seen it oh no I think the barber slipped is it'll slip slip the slip you slept with it in Turkish blood yeah like I said we are both kind of on the shore on this one at same time it is enjoyable cotton fingers but no like it's really really really strong there's little forefinger them and it you definitely taste the water how did you Ellen why you can I'm cooking cotton Iman there was me talking to cotton just took in the cotton down the holes yeah this is this is a honeydew melon one mmm Liam Lee would you want to read the description again with your business best dyslexia that's the devil's teeth let me zoom in slightly they go let me just finish your alarms well like turn it around it was bigger deaf dumb stupid devil Steve obviously were nasty juice is in a liquid from the brands fruity series combines succulent Holly do melon and I do I like I don't like melon at all you don't know this is true this is it's like your kryptonite no oh literally kryptonite another part violent one anyway with the hide you venom of a light sprinkling of fresh mint so a short description they're short but sweet that is worthy so what is it honeydew melon yeah and like supplement mmm fresh mint so I'm expecting this to be like the last one with a shuttle sweetness at the end and melon but bitter taste

remover yeah acetone from yeah yeah yeah give you the nail bars got the door open yeah oh yeah but it doesn't taste like it smells at all so if you get a bottle of these don't don't don't never judge a bottle by its mere I mean you can know it take it off me then you can smell a bottle and then dab a bit on your finger and lick it wonder sometimes smelling a bottle isn't how it actually tastes especially like one that is that smells a lot of like the metallic can with bits and bobs and you're right just smart nail varnish consider this as honeydew melon you use your phone I think I'm left with lemon you are this one I'm not massive fun well it just tastes like I could actually rip this melon whereas with most watermelons or honeydew melons I can't can't touch them it's kind of sickly that's that that must be that mint leaf result at the end it tastes like you know the little bits on top of food I just wanted some chewing gum yes yes while chewing gum and my stomach is saying I'm not sure so he's trying to trying to reject I've it's just that the mint isn't it the yeah yeah I see what you mean about that chewing gum kind of yeah it still he leaves your mouth yeah wondering quite quite like that even not a melon I could rip this and I will then I'm gonna bomb when I've got to the end of everything else little bit send that getting rusty yeah above the lip I was about to said you need to kiss me better that kind of gear nothing on yet really dirty was the carry from last night definitely the curry bro definitely curry curry hands right yeah quite like this one I want to move to the next one not because I've just seen what it isn't it's my favorite it's a fair but what is the next one oh boy remember your favorite boy you love the fat boy yes I'm very excited I don't like that I've got my DP a little bit DP right I need a wick I mean I eat your trip fresh stripper I'm just gonna tipster on cuz there I'm confident with this one my thoroughly thoroughly enjoyed this one I have another set of my cross this time fuse Clapton's I'm adventuring in a fancy builds at the moment just because Grimm green keeps talking about them in his vlogs how we go those uses like fuse Clapton's and they're big things so I'm venturing into them and I've noticed a bit of an improvement like with flavor and whatnot have you just tried it no I just think Malia just know like good boy those like sweaty fat boys but now it it's a smoking this week probably the other nicest smell so this one you can't judge a brother smell because it's little yeah grete smells incredible yeah just there's a strong mango likes like you taking like a smoothie you know you pop the can like a mango smoothie are the innocence movies and you know with it's just loved so the description for this one but bye bye Nattie juice is a juice from the Bruns fruity range so it's another one of them this eliquid combed lines are perfectly ripened juicy mango with a light sprinkling of mint to add extra freshness to the excellent VIP so it's another chewing gum kind of pull over then definitely a very very nice mango it's very fresh and ripe it's probably one of the nicer Mongolians I've had and definitely in a long time it's quite ripe and fresh as the description said yeah these plasticky ones like what's that mango on binary virus mango guava smells like cannabis so it's about this very cheap not fresh mango but yeah it's kind of like classic my artificial well this is nice and fresh and just delicious is really nice is really fresh and very sweet what should you buck down there on the viewfinders going hey dude tickle my fancy that did a first offense cloud all right I do then do a face-to-face clover it's the new credit card competition sophistication I know it's done cribbage Europeans law so yeah so the face to face cloud come on from Greens European event blog what just happened was they camera died Liam on a coffin lid onto the floor and it's just like literally just you know had a bit of a fit so we're gonna do the cloud first offense cloud comp again going and what we're going to do is in the comments below roughly we can't see but what you around the pot Liam or Danny I don't know how you win this grim just announced and they look quite fun so it's going to do it another three big orbital well okay I think I won cuz I at least vape on me that's that that's first offense cloud comets sermon if they don't you think yeah hashtag face-to-face I'm lost for a minute we're up we're up one fat boy Emily oh yeah that the great mango no yeah he had a coffin fit no doesn't even member where he is gone to my head man hello might be driver there yeah that's just gone drag but their birth pretty fighting some it's all right for me I've got to say I need a real I need a dry off and render up the next one so this is fat boy this is the right mango and mint one yup it's delicious it's pretty the best one so first I would say sir yeah okay on par with like that that no no for me that and the purple here's wicked here yeah them to a nice yeah just don't be drunk yeah I'm gonna dripping wet with off I went up to wet and wet my whistle in my wake for the next video for the next day juice and feel next one is where are we we're on a slow blow I couldn't be bothered to rework that so I've just dripped around will really dry dry dry con ground Roderick I might singed actually yeah it smells really nice which one's this don't try it before me farther are you sure like premature oh my jewels converse they're so slow blow me windy pops slow block the flavor of pineapple it's right missus for there's an actual pineapple slice and the cameras can I'm gonna work out what this smell is get doesn't smite pineapple doesn't do either but good my nose apply it so it kind of smells like the next part the flavor of pineapple lien with lime Sauder that will surely make you lose its freshness without getting bored sounds amazing the thin points for a second there we sounded like a QVC four o'clock in the morning stand out your head out to advertising channel so slow blow with its pineapple in lime soda sounds notice maybe the wish first for the smell yeah okay hmm no it's kind of it smells like lime you just said you have a blocked up nodes are you making that up prove it this nostril is a block look it's just all right okay I'll let your off that's what I split my good nose I've got a good nose or the bad nose that would just read like nothing it's not it's got like a limey saw yeah you worked in a bar with other large stuff you punk Orioles when you put the cocktails like lemon juice in language oh just the truth it's just yes smells like a lime juice but that pineapple must be the thing making it not smell anyway it smells nice so that's what I'm getting at a cigar always says nice oh well this is a compare for the narcissus niceness nice nurses his competition for the next one the Nashville yeah that's definitely am definitely lime definitely purple moly I was reading in yeah that's definitely hit me instantly with a nice flavor compared the last one which was nice but this has tickled my air Tish puts a little bit work out the difference the inhale the XL but it's quite similar inhale and exhale you get the lie get the lime on the inhale I get more of an acid aftertaste oh yeah tastes like that line shorter in America that I add they also make ginger cream swordancer me I saw a play and then running on love cream so do I scream I scream scream so if you want to send us some no anyways when I was on the plane in New York I think that like different kinds of drinks it was like tonics order ginger and the real I'm on and I got the lime on it in this case like the lime Slurpee juice things I add and then the exhale you get the pineapple trumpet sound Goodman definitely get the pineapple on the exhale because that's where it gets a bit of fresh own you get fruity oh that's tasty real taste like that that's the last the best of me um I mean if they'll jump the gun my next question is if you have to pick it's combination of three Oh top three with your third I don't know but we don't think I'm doing the bit I think I know mine I don't mind why don't we do out of it while we're the end of the video Liam oh we've reviewed them all okay well I heard that okay well in third place here's a third place right I'm gonna get my third one right yeah I know what you bear not copy me can you just seen mine no then I'm coming you burn oh no I think you haven't my third place is wicked here's and that's the called blackcurrant lemonade yeah it was delicious refreshing and I could viv this all day long my was a SUP grape really I really enjoyed it but compared to the aventine I've got picked up next then it's an odd competitor it I love the able to I think that I think we're going to be the same on the next one mmm in second place for me you've just changed it okay dropped him at our okay the fat boy mango with mint was refreshing tasted great and I could fit this all day that's my number yo and mine was slow blow which was the boy destroyed the pineapple which is my number one because I respect you had a bit more flavor than the mango just with the pond up and the lime you know the pine in the lime and you me clear up the coconut alignment of pineapple lime in the pineapple one had a little bit more depth of flavor was having two different inhale that kill flavors so that was number one for me whereas the the beautiful mango one was second my mango fat boy it was was number one for me today I just are you I felt it's baby all day every day and I'm like open slop Roger because I'm enjoying it I enjoy both if I do they've they're all they're all nice they're all really beautiful they are are really nice and to be honest third place is a bit of a joint for me it is hard between wicked and bad blood because they were both black currants they were both very nice what's your least favorite who need you for me I don't like mark I'm a mix of I've mostly by Real ID or or honeyed really yeah see the grip would be like last cuz obviously grips a bit meant for me but what they wanted you melon I didn't really like at all it was pleasant and I could vape it and as I said it went over and out the rest of all my other juices I'll rip it but it just didn't hit me but if you're a melon lover you will like it same as you if you're agreeable over you'll love ear sucker if you missed the lens there you know what curry ends so that pretty much wraps on the whole nasty orange they're all 70/30 they're all 50 mil bottles they are aluminium the 70/30 three milligrams good Royals yeah nice clouds perfect tank juice at 70/30 as well try blown it this way because of that where the camp looked look at the viewfinder Lily there you go so you can see the dense clouds now I'm me yeah yeah that nasty juice it's a nice range there's something in there

and do that gay stuff so yeah you think about what goodbye internets yeah I have to do it I have to do [Music] 50", "fUDMjaGMM7A": "[Music] hey guys dr sean miravichy here and i know it's been a while since my last video i apologize for that it's been tricky with new covid restrictions i can't really get into my studio i've been waiting to be able to get in there but i've sort of come to the realization that i gotta start doing these videos from my house which is okay so welcome to my house and my living room uh so today's video is something that i promised to do a while ago and i've had people wondering when it's going to happen so today what i wanted to go over is proper vape technique now i'm not saying that i have all the information there is to know about how to properly vape or that my technique is the best technique what i want to bring to the table is the fact that i have been vaping for about a year and a half two years quite regularly i've tried different vape systems i've tried different techniques so i'll bring that to the table i'm also bringing to the table my knowledge as a naturopathic doctor and a cannabis educator when it comes to safety effectiveness and different administration systems and all that so i hope to bring some insight from that perspective as well so let's get into it um what i have today is the 510 system which basically is two parts you have a battery system that heats up your oil and you have the actual cartridge which houses the oil and they just fit together like that now there's lots of different vape systems out there there's the pac system um there's dry herb vaporizers this information will apply to all those uh systems so it's not just about the 510 this is just what i i've been using for a while and i like this system it's easy to use it's discrete it's small so that's why i like this system okay so there's a few things to keep in mind with vaping number one and this is from mostly a a safety health perspective but also i believe that it does have some benefits with effectiveness is the length of time that you keep the vapor in your lungs so uh it's a misconception that you have to hold in vapor much like holding in smoke when you're smoking a joint a lot of people think like if you hold it in for a long amount of time you're going to get that much of a better experience where actually in my research and my experience holding in smoke or vapor increases the likelihood of exposing yourself to potential carcinogens and talks and toxins and actually doesn't really uh dramatically improve the effectiveness so the trade-off is very unequal so you're exposing yourself to more possible toxins and you're not really getting much added benefit from holding in that vapor so the number for the first tip is to not hold in the smoke and vapor uh pretty much let it do its job and breathe it out number two is uh is about heat level okay so with the uh 510 system you're kind of limited in in what you can do in terms of heat on this particular battery there's three heat settings there's a low there's a medium and there's a high other systems you can fine tune the heat setting a lot more what to keep in mind is you want the lowest amount of effective heat let me break that down so you want an effective vapor or smoke or whatever it is well we're talking about vapor vape so vapor at the lowest possible heat setting so this will require a little bit of experimentation and different oils different strains different types of herbs will require different amounts of heat so you're going to have to experiment with the particular cartridge or or or herb that you're using and you want to start low and gradually build it up until you get that desired effect so don't start like high right off the bat because we want to minimize the potential for combusting the herb so the whole point of vaporization is to minimize the amount of carcinogens and toxins we're exposed to because we're not putting the oil or the herb into combustion basically burning it we're just trying to vaporize the terpenes and the cannabinoids so you want that lowest effective setting i've personally found that most cartridges for me the best setting is the medium setting there are a couple that will be okay on the lowest setting there's a couple that will be better on the highest setting but most do perfectly on the medium setting and what i usually find is that with the lowest setting i don't really get a thick vapor and that translates to not the desired effect that i want it's it's um it's not potent enough so i do find that the medium setting uh works best for these purposes all right so now let's get into a bit of the technique so what i really like to do and um i don't know if other people do this but i found this works the best for a few reasons is i like to have my mouth as a sort of pre-chamber for the vapor before it actually enters into my lungs this sort of works the same way as a bong would in terms of the smoke going into a chamber first before it's inhaled and what this does is it helps to cool down the vapor a little bit and and settle some of the harshness of the vapor so it's easier on the lungs and the respiratory tract so what i end up doing is almost like sucking in the vapor like you would puffing a cigar not inhaling it directly and then breathing in that vapor once you feel like you've got a good amount in the mouth inhaling the vapor and then breathing it out after about a second or so and i've found that that works the best so let me demonstrate how that all looks so here's my 510 system vaporization system the battery i'm using is from san rafael and that's just because my original purchase for the 510 system was from san rafael and the cartridge i'm using is the good supply pineapple express i am really liking this cartridge um check out the review it's going to be coming to you guys shortly but a little teaser is that this is definitely top three for me which i didn't expect it to be um it's just it's so common uh that i thought okay this would be just you know another cartridge but it's actually really special all right so that's um that's the system i'm using now when you you activate this by clicking it five times and then you get an indicator that it's been activated you could change the temperature setting uh by clicking it was it two or three i forgot what i did so now it's on the high setting which is uh indicated by a red light it's on two yeah it's two clicks and so that brings it to the low setting which is green light as you can see that and then but i know that oops oh i think i put it into a preheat setting hold on let me just get out of this okay one two all right now we're back to the medium setting all right so um i actually will be inhaling this for a longer time that you might expect because i like to build up the smoke or not smoke vapor in the mouth a nice good amount of it and what i usually use as an indicator that i've gotten enough of a dose in my mouth is i start to feel a little bit of something in the mouth like a warmth and that's how i know i've got a good amount and then what i'm going to do once once i've got enough in there and so that inhalation period is going to take about uh probably about five seconds or so and then i'm going to breathe it in just like a nice deep um yogic breath uh if you will and and then i'm just going to breathe it right out no holding no nothing when this is done correctly you're going to find that you only need like one or two puffs from your vaporizer to have the desired effect that you want so this is how it all looks and that's it that's how it all looks together so just to break that down once more what i did there was i activated the vaporizer i sucked in vapor into my mouth not inhaling yet for about i guess that was about three to five seconds and then i'll breathe in all that vapor that i captured in my mouth and then breathe it right out and that's all you need to do that when you expose the lung tissue to that vapor just even for a second you're going to absorb all the necessary cannabinoids and terpenes almost immediately and you're going to really minimize the risk of exposing your lung tissue to any possible carcinogens even though there's a lot less significantly less probably 90 percent less potential toxins in vapor as opposed to smoke so that's my tips for proper vaporization technique um i really want you guys to comment on this video tell me if you have any techniques that you have found to be more effective what what did you like about my technique what do you think's an issue with my technique uh feel free to comment and all that stuff and please subscribe if you haven't already i'll be back soon with i have a couple more videos that uh that i really want to do uh one is definitely a review on the pineapple express from good supply i'm also working on a really exciting project for you guys where i'm actually going to be interviewing a dispensary owner here in toronto and going through that whole experience about setting up a dispense a legal dispensary so that's going to be a really exciting one and then i also want to do a cannabis education video so that will be coming up soon on um cannabis and sports and athletics uh so everything from recovery to sports enhancement will uh i'll definitely cover for you guys so until then have a great day have a great week and i'll see you soon", "SBiNwQibNzQ": "we're outside of dispenser here in illinois and

zero to 100 like in terms of dollars that's the currency okay if i were to sell it i could sell it for 69. what do you think about the taste crisp clear crisp and clear it's piney you know what like yeah if you got a taste for it you know exactly what you want if you don't smoke tsc very much excuse me i mean taste and flavor-wise yeah that's worth the money that's why it's worth any dollar amount you assigned to right up to i'd say 60 70 bucks i could pick me worth it it would be low it would be well worth it batman flavor is high quality i like that i like that i do i like it what do you know about delta a thc nothing nothing nothing okay let's try it and see how you like it yeah alright yeah cool [Applause] so i know it's a big battery don't be too intimidated i gotta just press

vape batteries now we've been getting a lot of questions on what the differences are between different types of stick batteries so this quick video is gonna give you guys a nice little tutorial about what the key differences are between stick batteries and a lot of these we actually do sell so the first question is what is 510 thread 510 thread is the actual thread adapter that is used by a majority of vape cartridges these are cartridges they're prefilled with CBD or different medical oils that you can pick up at your dispensary and what companies will do is they will pre-fill these so that you buy just a cartridge and then you go and purchase and attach it to your own battery in order for you to be able to vape so 99% of the cartridges sold in dispensaries and CBD shops use what is called a 5-10 thread which is actually just the threading of the cartridge now not only do prefilled cartridges use this but a lot of just vape products like even slim wax adapters like our silencer they also use a 5-10 thread so they can appeal for the dabbing crowd so once you've figured out what you want to vape then it comes down to picking your battery and what the differences are between your batteries and what i've done is i've narrowed them down to four main types of batteries the first one and one of our most popular ones is the twist style battery so it has a 5-10 thread which will allow you to screw in the cartridge like for example our performance cartridge to screw that into the battery so it has a 5-10 thread adapter there or an end right there it has a push button which means that you have to push hold the button throughout your inhale and because it's a twist battery it has a little twist knob here that allows you to adjust the intensity of your vape and this one goes between 2 volts and 4 volts 4 volts being higher giving you greater intensity now how do you turn this battery on once you have your vape Karcher attached you simply push this button 5 times to turn it on 1 2 3 4 5 and you see it's gonna flash and that means that you are ready to vape once your cartridge is on there now most of these twist batteries ours included does have a preheat function on it for when you're using a cartridge for the first time there's thick materials in there that need to be preheated before you can vape and that's achieved by pushing the button when it's on twice in succession so you push it twice rapidly one two and you see the LED is changing colors there that means there's going through a low voltage preheat to get your cartridge right of vaping at any time during the preheat you can push the button to exit so that is our twist battery it is very simple to use not a lot of clicking adjustable power there nice 510 battery these are a high capacity and they come in several colors I brought along the multicolor in the red and we actually even just launched a brand new carbon fiber version which it uses real carbon fiber so there's a real carbon fiber version right here the other battery is a 5-10 variable voltage non twist battery so you have your 510 adapter here that you can screw your cartridges into or of a products that you buy like for example your prefilled cartridge show you guys we're prefilled one looks like so here's a pretty little prefilled cartridge simply screw it on in there this one is a variable voltage but it's a non twist this is actually a pass-through as you can see a pass-through meaning that the charging port is here at the bottom so you can actually if you're vaping and it's running down or you're one of those people who works at your desk or in your car you can have it plugged into microUSB have the battery on in succession while you're charging the battery which means you don't have to take off the cartridge to screw in a charger so this one does not have a twist function on it this has just a button but you still have variable voltage and preheat the difference is is that you would change the voltage by clicking the buttons and Wogan that so to turn the unit on you click the button five times rapidly one two three four five as you see it blinks right there now it's on if you wanted to go in to preheat as we do it the other battery same thing push the button two times one two and you can see the LED again is going into the color change mode you can exit that at any time to get out of preheat mode and if you want to change the voltage what you do is you push the button three times quickly one two three and what you'll notice is that the LED changes different color now what that signifies there is that now you're on a different voltage level so your power intensity has been adjusted and this battery actually comes with three voltage settings three different intensity levels and you can cycle through them by just clicking the button three times one two three now you see the LED turn blue so blue red and green so that shows your variable voltage nan twist five ten stick battery for your reference the other battery that I've outlined is a 5-10 thread a lot of people refer to this as a stylus because it has a little stylus tip that people used to use for their Palm Pilots and you could use for your cell phones and touchscreen devices but as you will notice this battery is a standard it's a buttonless battery so it doesn't have a button on it so what you do is when you put your cartridge on there you don't have to turn it on or anything like that just make sure it's charged all you have to do is inhale so it's a different action you don't push and hold the button throughout the duration your vape as the other two batteries we showed you you just simply inhale and it will turn it on a couple of things to point out at this battery so a lot of companies do sell batteries like this we don't because for auto draws to fire ceramic cartridges they have to be much more powerful and we offer auto draw models like our elf concealers and elf twist but they provide a lot more power so they can fire ceramic cartridges that have thick heaters this little battery doesn't have much power to fire some of the more modern cartridges the other thing is it to be Auto draw it requires your cartridges to have an air hole at the bottom like this one let's see if we can zoom in to make sure people see that there's an air hole here so this cartridge has an air hole which means that when you inhale it lets the air travel through the cartridge which then reacts with a little sensor microphone in the battery that signals the battery to turn on into vaporize now if we take a look at these two cartridges we'll notice that they don't have air holes so you would technically not be able to use these two cartridges on this Auto draw battery stylus battery when you would be able to vape them just fine with the twist batteries I showed you before or the non twist variable voltage battery that I showed you just before that so that's just a little bit to keep in mind when you're selecting your 5/10 or your perfect 510 third stick battery now the last battery that's pretty popular is this ego style battery now this is a 510 and also stick battery and I see a lot of people carrying these with cartridges that ask however you'll see this is a little bit different than this because look at the the difference this this right here is flattened flush where you screw the cartridge in and this one kind of pokes out and you have this exposed piece that's because there's two different 510 threads is your standard 510 cartridge thread so it's your 510 C thread and this one is your 510 ego thread an ego thread means that there used to be cartridges for a liquid that would screw on to the exterior of this and make an interior connection so you can use it with the older style eliquid tanks as well as with prefilled cartridges well you'll notice is if you're really into just prefilled cartridges is when you screw it into this ego tank it this transition looks a little funky it'll still work and they work good but you'll see that this just doesn't look that nice it looks like I need like a transition piece of metal there like a skirt or something like that and you know this is a fatter battery so as you could see the widths don't exactly line up like other tanks like this you'll see it's a much smoother transition it looks like they're all one piece versus like this now there's lots of ego batteries on the market there's ones that have twist knobs there's ones that are longer the thing is that you can these are about 500 milliamp hour batteries for so that's a pretty good decent capacity for a battery these ones are usually between 350 and 650 they're this size you can get longer ones or all the way up to 1200 or 1100 milliamp hours so you can get ultra high-capacity powerful fat ego batteries like this but one of the trade-offs is if you do use a lot of cartridges they're not gonna line up they're not gonna look a hundred percent with these stick batteries they line up so you can use all different types of heating materials like ceramic cartridges standard a stainless steel or organic cotton coil cartridges you can use high performance ceramic like our performance tank you can even use wax tanks like our silencer with these little 510 thread batteries so we hope that today's video was useful in showing you guys the differences between the different 510 thread battery types and we familiarize you with some of the pros and cons are of each one so when you are on the market trying to pick up a 5-10 thread stick battery you can see some of these differences and figure out which 510 thread stick battery works perfect for you for lots of cool products that you've seen here today you can check out our website

"3DUkkphRYWk": "hey y'all trevor here with ready to leave and today on this thursday we're going to be tapping into one of the first 1 gram cartridges that came to the market we've got versus originals tropic lemon cartridge the one grammar i'm excited to see how this does you guys i hope you are too we'll see on the other side of the intro when we're tapping into this cartridge and uh getting into this review y'all cheers and i'll see you over there welcome back you guys so as i said in the intro we are going to be trying out one of the first one gram carts to the alberta market this one grammar was brought to us by verse originals and it is a tropic lemon thc vape cartridge it came in with a thc total of 83.4 percent a cbd total of point one three percent and a package date of august nineteenth twenty twenty one nice thing is this one gram cartridge of course let's mute the laptop so we don't get any more of those the nice thing about this one gram cartridge is it did come in right around the 50 mark so it's equivalent to some of our half gram cartridges out there so the cost is definitely within reason i've got the burst website pulled up you guys we're gonna quickly rattle through that information before we get into the full on urban scale so meet tropic 11 a potent sativa vape with a bold citrusy flavor by verse originals our best in class formulations hardware and value popular lemon jack and tropic thunder strains inspire tropic lemons terpene rich terpenes like limonene terrapiline and mercene produce a uniquely balanced floral and citrus aroma our ultra refined extraction extraction makes tropic lemon an extremely pure distillate the high performance cartridge is compatible with 510 batteries and is made of medical grade stainless and features a ceramic heating element and mouthpiece huge benefit that this is going to be ceramic as well a one gram worth of ceramic mouthpiece and heating coil hugely beneficial you guys so the strains are going to be a lemon jack and tropic thunder cross and the key terpenes are going to be carefully impeding meristening terpene and lemony the senses are going to be botanical terpenes sour citrus flora aroma fruity herbal citrus flavors clear golden appearance ooh i'm very very excited to uh try this cartridge out you guys but the only way we're going to be able to do that is if we actually crack this container and get into it so let's do that urban scale intro first and then we will tap into this container of tropic lemon and see how it does to the vape y'all cheers and i'll see on the other side [Music] welcome back you guys so for those of you who have been here before you know how we're going to do this for those who haven't let me explain it for you the way we do these vaporizers rip vaporizers review ooh that's a beautiful looking one graham cart nice and tall full oh she's looking pretty but as i was saying the way we do these reviews is we start out by uh sparking it up on the fireside battery at the lowest temp before we work our way up through the three to the highest and after that let's get this purple monkey card off here we've got the g pen battery that we run it through and then after that we go back to the fireside run it through a little mad hatter bell there and then back to the g pen for our 420 rig so we've got lots of glass lots of smoke coming your way in the next 15-ish minutes so let's get through it you guys let's start cruising through the vaporizer starting out with the lowest temp on the fire side let's take a first haul through this see how it tastes and i'll uh be letting you guys know as we're smoking through this one but first oh that thc sticker is placed in there so we need getting that sucker off let's just start smoking y'all cheers okay that was very unique tasting does have that tropical touch to it it's kind of like that trident um tropical punch gum that is very much what i'm tasting here while you're walking through a pine grove because it is just so piney in a very dewy undertone way and i'm enjoying it you guys so we've got it set to the second temperature let's crush it on there and uh i'll let you guys know how it is after that okay guys so got the fireside ready at the highest time surprisingly same flavor through the second temp as the first the only difference is i got more pepper on it and it came with a little bit more of a burn but saying that it's not it's not unenjoyable it's not overwhelming it's nothing like that it's just a nice little burn in the back your throat i think blinking this cartridge might be a little bit of a tougher job than i was originally expecting with that first draw you guys but i've got high's temp set up let's uh take a rip through there and see how this cartridge tastes at the highest temp on the fireside battery y'all cheers and i'll see on the other side when we're uh tapping into the g-pad and i'm giving you the score for the fireside battery cheers i'm going to give the fireside a 9 out of 10 you guys honestly very enjoyable flavor i i do like it quite a bit and if it didn't have that kind of pepper punch near the end or on the higher temps the little bit heavier pepper punch i could give this a 10 but that the pepper just throws me off a little bit from that tropical pine type of flavor and that's really what i'm enjoying from this cartridge you guys is that tropical citrusy piney that sweeter blend not so much the peppers but um we've got it on the g pen you guys we're going to start it out on here see how it does we're going to run three quick pulls through the three different temperatures and i'll let you guys know what i taste all my way through but uh for the time being cheers let's get going on this [Music] as much as it's giving me that tropical citrus peppery flavor it's actually reminding me a little bit of my auto lemon drop home grow like it's got that type of flavor and that um super lemon haze that that auto lemon drop is has got a touch of a pepper to it and i'm i'm enjoying it quite a bit i wasn't expecting it at all but overall the flavor that i'm getting from this cartridge is really enjoyable you guys so we've got the second temp ready to go on the g pen let's take a quick haul through there and see how that's gonna taste and affect this review y'all so let's get through that we'll get through the high stamp and then we get to rip through some rigs but for the time being cheers [Music] okay incredibly smooth again i am very much finding this similar to that pure sun farms cart where it's just incredibly smooth with that ceramic coil ceramic mouthpiece it's just a cleaner taste and a cleaner pull you guys and i'm i'm enjoying it quite a bit again that tropical that kind of tropical punch trident gum i'm not getting the pepper through the g pen that i was getting through the fireside vape which is a huge benefit for me i really do like that tropical punch kind of flavor without the pepper kick and this cart is doing incredibly well for providing that you guys and i'm i'm enjoying it quite a bit but now we're gonna go ahead and take our last rip through just a pure vaporizer before we move on over into the glass and uh start having a lot more fun with what we're smoking here you guys but for the time being spark up the g pen at the highest tab and see how it tastes cheers i'm gonna give the g pen a nine out of ten you guys honestly it's a stronger nine than uh than the fire side but the pepper it's just there's something about it that's got me turning a little bit away from this flavor and really is just slightly disappointing with it but you guys i just hope that the glass and the water helps um create a little bit of a better environment for uh for that lemon and the citrus and the sweet flavors to uh perk and develop and leave that peppery behind but honestly the only way we get to find out how this is gonna taste is by trying it out and finding out how it's gonna taste guys so let's start doing it with the mad hatter we're gonna run through the three temperatures again no talking in between this time just three quick rips and then we chat about it afterwards before we move on with the g pen and do the same thing but you guys enough talking from me we preheat the last rib i'll let you know when we're doing that but let's get some cheers i guess we're running off the highest temp first you guys so we'll preheat the medium temp this time really sweet very little pepper until that preheat and the first one we were running on the highest temp that was where i got the most pepper and it was very much a dry cough producing pepper experience and i honestly did enjoy it it it it was a little bit too much pepper in my opinion but that's a pretty small adjustment for uh this cartridge so far you guys but we're going to uh quickly rip it through the 420 rig i'll give you guys the glass score the high and then we'll wrap it up with the overall but for the time being this cartridge is doing pretty good you guys let's see how it's going to do through the glass start on the lowest work our way up to the highest you know how it goes cheers and i'll be back on the other side [Music] okay yes taste from a glass nine out of ten really enjoyable and honestly not what i was expecting when i first picked up this cartridge and smoked it i wasn't expecting such a tropical flavor i was definitely expecting more of a lemon jacket like a peppery lemon combo but this was incredibly sweet you guys and very very flavorful overall and i i enjoyed it quite a bit for um all three ways to smoke but that pepper a little bit of the burn on the back your throat you guys that's the key key thing that knocked it knocked it down a couple notches so nine out of ten across the board for flavors very enjoyable very good put out cart now when it comes to the high i'm only going to give it an 8 out of 10. and that's just due to the intensity not being where i would expect it to be after smoking these reviews i should be feeling the high really strong and there shouldn't be any contemplation about well what what am i feeling this card i've got a little bit of a like it is very much a assistant to whatever i'm smoking if i have a really good bowl and i pre-load it with this i'm gonna be [ __ ] up afterwards but just the cartridge ain't gonna do it for me right like it's that kind of a high that's a little bit disappointing but what i am experiencing is a very light easing and relaxation of like emotional easing relaxation not so much body and then a clear-headed uplift like it's got that kind of uplifting energetic kick and that easing of stress anxiety the two work in combination very well together and i'm enjoying it absolutely but i wish i wish it was stronger yes so with uh that eight out of a ten i got a 35 out of 40 for an overall which is a really good score it did incredibly well and honestly the few things that it was missing are really just preference points for me and i'm gonna be honest with you guys i'll tell you when it's a quality thing i'll tell you when it's a dryness thing and i'll tell you when it's a personal preference thing this cartridge the points that it's lost is a personal preference did incredibly well verse originals great job with this one gram card i am very much looking forward to enjoying the rest of this still quite full one grammar and uh yeah you guys we'll be back with some more content uh tomorrow we've got the bc organic blue dream from simply bear that review coming here guys where this friday and then we've got the weekly wrap-up at the end of the week which always is going to be something a little bit more unique for you guys

cartridge for this review we've got phyto extracts fire stick 2.0 it's their pink kush dislip pen i'm really excited to try this out and see how it does y'all let's get into it we'll see on the other side when we're tapping off the little bit of info that's on here before we get into the full on urban scale see on the other side cheers welcome back you guys so as i said in the intro we are tapping into fido extracts pink kush 510 cartridge so this sucker came in with a thc total of 79.1 percent it's got zero cbd in it and it was packaged on the 15th of may 2020 i'm just gonna start pulling it apart while we're chatting through the information so we've got the lift and co website pulled up with this information you guys so we'll uh run all that off before we tap into this beautiful looking car so we've got pink kush 510 cartridge pink kush is an indica dominant hybrid that much like it's close relative og kush delivers a sweet aroma accompanied by a distinct herbal taste these point five gram distillate cartridges are made from food grade all natural terpenes with zero fillers and additives it contains 75 to 85 thc and no cbd we use top of the line c cell cartridges that features a ceramic heating element when filled this heating element absorbs up to 0.15 milliliter of the 0.5 mil of oil contained in the cartridge this can lead to the appearance of a head space at the top of the cartridge each of our cartridges are auto filled by weight to ensure that you receive exactly 0.5 of oil with 100 accuracy we need to get that thc sticker off there so we'll throw that on the torch while we uh rattle off the oh they don't have any more information you guys so uh i'm going to stick this on the torch while we uh do the urban scale intro and then we'll tap into this cartridge y'all cheers and i'll see on the other side of this intro [Music] welcome back you guys so we've got the pink kush cartridge right here we're gonna get rid of all those silicone dude ads screw this into the fireside battery and start a rocking with this sucker we're going to start out on the lowest temp come on there we go white light starting on the lowest temp we're going to take a rip through there we're going to go up to the medium and then the high try it all the way through there i'll give you a little bit of my thoughts and opinions on it after that and then we will go on into the g pen battery before we put our adapter on here and we start ripping it through a couple of glass pieces that we have here as well you guys i'm really looking forward to seeing how this pink kush hits taste i'm just excited to see how fido did their transition from the dark black gray market into this legal market so uh only way we're gonna find out you guys is by tapping in and finding out so uh let's do that cheers i like the elongated tip on this they're similar to what trailblazer had but it's a longer glass tip and i like that okay so it is kind of a sweet herbal flavor nothing overwhelming nothing really that screams excitement for me but it's definitely one of the better tasting pink kush products i've tried so now we're on that medium temp let's uh take a haul at this level and see what it tastes like here you guys cheers okay guys so got a good herbal push on that one got a little bit of a pepper flavor as well which wasn't disappointing it just wasn't expected i'm i'm liking it now it balances out with that kind of sweet herbal it's but it's not a really overpowering flavor it's strong when you have it in your mouth and when you exhale but it really dissipates quickly after that which is a little bit disappointing for me but still not bad so uh we've got it on the highest temp guys let's take a rip through here see how it does uh before we switch it on over to the g pen cheese yes we moved over to the g pen from that fireside battery i'm only going to give it a 7 out of 10. it had a nice flavor to it but it didn't hit hard enough to hold the flavor and it didn't have a really enjoyable enough flavor to make me want to just keep hauling on it so i have it in my mouth it's it's that good for one hit kind of a high and flavor not necessarily high but it's good for like a one hit it's not really that sugary treat that i'm finding my vape cartridges are really more what that's for they're kind of for that dessert of smoking right i'm i'm done having this harder [ __ ] i'm done smoking that i'm like bong rips and dabs and stuff like this i just want something light to sip on with a really sweet flavor and that's definitely where these come in handy but uh seven out of ten is the best i'm gonna give it for the fire side moving on into the g pen we've got it set on the lowest temperature let's see how it does and taste through here you guys before we move on and rock it through the glass i'm expecting a pretty good outcome from this let's see cheers okay guys we're on that medium level let's see how it does i got almost more of a sour cush kind of push with this it was nice it was really unique for uh the changes from that fireside battery and it's one of the biggest reasons why i like using different batteries you guys because you do get a totally different experience with these and i'm really really enjoying this pink kush so far but got on the medium temp let's tap in and try it out cheers so we've got it on the highest temp you guys okay let's get into this i am feeling this pink kush already which is not something i am used to i haven't had a pink cush strain hit hard and have a really good high for me like ever the flower just it's a strain that doesn't really do much so this this this pens got me excited you guys so we've got on the highest temp let's see how it does through here before we uh move on and give it a score on that medium level i still got that kind of sour kush taste which i enjoyed i'm i'm not upset with that kind of sour dank cushy flavor but uh let's see if the high temp does the same thing you guys cheers okay guys so i'm gonna give the g pen made out of a tent it had just a little bit more of that kind of sour cushy flavor that i do really enjoy and definitely look forward to when i'm smoking these kind of these kind of carts this pink kush is definitely uh something that's caught me off guard you guys and i'm really looking forward to seeing how it's gonna taste to the glass but uh we've got we are a mad bell here a little mad hatter bell we've got the fireside battery ready to go we are starting out at the lowest temp again working our way up to the high we do preheat on our high temp only because why not so uh yeah i think that's all the info we need y'all let's start doing this i'll see on the other side of these uh these three rips cheers last two let's preheat it y'all [Music] okay guys we're back on the g pen we've got a 420 rig we're gonna tap into this and uh see how this pen does you guys i'm uh definitely looking forward to um seeing the flavor on it but uh the only way we can find out how it does is by finding out how it is low tam first medium then we preheat on the high just like that last bit get to y'all cheers [Music] last rip y'all cheers preheat it sink okay guys so i'm gonna give it an eight out of a ten from the glass had definitely that sweeter flavor that i was looking for um it did end up being a little bit harsher than i was expecting through the rig so that's why it's not quite the nine like it had the potential for the nine for the intensity of the flavor that was there but there was a harshness to it that just i didn't quite enjoy um and i bumped it down the point for that but all in all very well put together card for the flavor on the glass through the just sucking it straight through the vape it was really really nice and i i'm quite impressed honestly overall with this pig kush because i've been nothing but disappointed by it now moving into the high i'm going to give it a 9 out of a 10. the reason the point is docked is easier to explain it doesn't have any body effects it is strictly mental which is what i'm finding the majority of these cards to be is a head high and that's a little bit disappointing for me just because i've heard some really nice and enjoyable body effects that go with this pink kush but i'm just not finding it right now you guys just doesn't quite have it and that's it's a bit of a disappointment for me but there's there's nothing much i can do about it i'm gonna enjoy what i do get out of it which is that really nice heavy head high and overall i i think they did a pretty good job for the high and the flavor you guys moving to the overall with a 32 out of 40 i think it did overall very well um very sweet flavor definitely strong on that side um especially when we got into the glass or through the g pen but that little bit of a peppery harshness to the end when you bump that the temperature up to the highest levels is a touch of a turn off for me and a big reason why it lost at least one point in most of the taste scales and then just the lack of the sweet to comprom to uh to balance it out is typically the other reason why i would uh dock some points but overall you guys this this this cartridge did pretty well and i uh i'm quite impressed uh if you guys have tried it let me know down below what you think if you've tried any of uh phyto extracts cartridges let me know what you think we've had the super lemon hazel one in stock too and i was intrigued to try that one but uh the pink kush was definitely the one i think i needed to try first just to get a basis of where fido wanted to run with it and they they took a hell of a good run in my opinion you guys but uh let's drop this sucker up when the end card slides in you

mrs. Smith here and today we're going to be reviewing the heavy hitters cannabis infused gummies we have strawberry pineapple to try today we're actually very excited to try these uh if you don't know already heavy-hitters is possibly our favorite brand I would definitely say I would say it's also primarily smoke heavy hitters for our everyday cartridge and then when we want to like it up a little bit we'll grab some other stuff but heavy hitters is definitely always on a cartridge for us so we're also going to be trying the heavy hares GSC I say trying we've had it many times but we haven't been able to find it for a while not what you are it kind of it kind of went out of stock just weird it used to be available a lot in like 2018 but it kind of just fell out of favor except for certain places would still carry a guy in town by our main delivery service was no longer carrying it but they had it the other day so I had to pick it up cause it's been too long it seems like they almost haven't had it in stock since the name change so JSC used to be Girl Scout cookies I don't know if they changed it in others stances I'm pretty sure it was part of the laws that happened I'm pretty sure it's part of the laws that happened in 2018 for California that's they weren't allowed to call it they can't call it candy I believe they can't use the term candy and they can't use the term anything that could be marketed yes towards children can't market towards children right Paul any so that's why it says gummies or it'll always seem medical or cannabis like that they never never make yeah that would be appealing to a child exactly it can't be bears or anything like that so I mean it's a good law honestly I totally understand why there's some other laws that happened in 2018 which I will give you a refresher on right now now there was some weird stuff that happened when California passed a recreational marijuana back in 2018 I believe it was one of the things that happen is towards the middle of the year they actually switched it to where edibles could no longer contain more than a hundred milligrams per package now if you work in the medical marijuana industry or if you were a user or anything like that prior you know that there used to be packages up to a thousand milligrams in just one treat and what that used to be really good at is you could like just take a nibble off of a treat throughout the day and just kind of keep yourself dosed and medicated off one treat for a whole week basically but they changed it because there were way too many people who would come into a dispensary have no idea what they were doing by one of those really high potency edibles eat the whole thing and then they have a really bad time and end up going to the emergency room they got sick of dealing with that so they made a law saying you can't have more than a hundred milligrams per package there are certain things you can get around that such as cannabutter tinctures and pills those three items you can definitely get in higher doses than 100 milligrams but for edibles and then kind of cookie or anything like that max you're gonna get in a package is about a hundred so today we're reviewing B's from heavy hitters and the way they went about with these twenty milligrams per piece is you can actually rip the pieces in half so it's actually two servings per piece so it actually comes in two to ten milligram servings which I'm pretty sure is the law is that each piece inside a package can only be ten milligrams or something like that I know five to ten milligrams is a state recommended serving I'm not a hundred percent clear on the laws but it's just an unfortunate thing that happened with edibles in 2018 but I am absolutely dying to try these guns so let's go ahead and open up to the [ __ ] strawberry cuz I'm Joey it's been it's been a long time looking for out that let me grab the a7 r3 with the 70s [Music] [Music] yeah we just won't have us we won't help you all this video it's just not working at the moment six and a half hours Nathan I might open the pineapple real quick to maybe these do not open well I feel like we should show just how much of a struggle these were to open just like a montage of the [ __ ] difficulty this is bad this one opened much easier but that first package it just ripped in such a way that it was really hard to open but this is just like the other one has a really strong smell I figured it's it's really strong artificial pineapple mmm it's it's kind of a a bit herbal but not like too herbal it's not like overly pungent or anything like that like you're not gonna have you're not gonna get in trouble they're just keeping these in your drawer or anything like that like no one's gonna smell it yeah I don't know if this has any actual like pineapple juice or anything in it it doesn't have it listed on the ingredients mm-hmm so we're not sure if this is artificial flavoring or real bad no artificial actual coloring and flavor so is that natural flavors that display really use the natural coloring and flavor like or is it a flavor that's kind of that's kind of weird I don't know if I feel someone from heavy Harry's modified food yeah I don't mind it I mean that's just what I mean the people are heavy hitters you might want to put that it is natural flavoring as well like actually specified natural color and natural flavoring because natural color and flavoring just sounds a bit odd it's it leaves it up to the imagination as to is the flavoring also natural or just natural color you're always a nice flavoring this yeah always alright so let's try the pineapple yeah I'm gonna do a full 20 but I'm gonna show the camera how it splits so this is the gummies from heavy-hitters it's a square and if you look very carefully there's this little seam in the middle that if you pull whoops it starts to come apart yes it does if you start to pull it comes apart very nicely into two perfectly even ten milligram pieces so let's start well I'm actually just gonna eat the whole thing at once wait so where's our list of like criteria so I know what the hell I'm supposed to be doing bring it up go on top down your mouth and just roll around a little okay yeah my hands are all sticky now you know I gotta say I'm a little disappointed I'm a little underwhelmed actually I had I had much higher hopes it could just be the pineapple yeah because I mean the strawberry definitely smells better than the pineapple the pineapple is a little strong it's kind of it's very herbal forward which isn't a bad thing a lot of people enjoy that it's not a bad flavor necessarily but it is definitely herbal forward if you're looking for something that you could just totally mound shun and forget that there's weed in it not that we recommend it's not gonna be that yeah definitely don't recommend that but I mean like if you're if you're a fan of someone who like Eric or someone who likes really really flavorful very liked gummies that don't aren't bitter or plant alike at all this is not for you this is made to be strong and to be potent and it definitely tastes like it so keep that in mind and next up we have the strawberry so let's go ahead and pop these open and yeah will rate them in a second let's try the strawberry and I want to go ahead and split this one yeah because there'll be 30 milligrams each mmm much better much better mm-hmm all right strawberry is actually really good um I would say it's definitely pretty it is still has that herbal flavor but um let me bring up the criteria so we can actually start to break these down aftertaste yeah yeah really bad yeah I would say it's a bit odd I I'm almost feeling a little bit um disappointed I know me too it which it sucks because I'm such a fan of their oils but that's where comes in would we be as disappointed if we hadn't hyping it up so much yeah we did we we've also we've held on to these for about two weeks we've been waiting and waiting and waiting to try these specifically for the on camera experience and you know I think that also kind of built it up the fact that we've been we've been like dying sitting on me dying to try them the whole time and I mean they're they're good [ __ ] effects for sure by new user mm-hmm will probably like would probably really like it however its strong grams each heavy hitters recommends 10 milligrams as a dose the state of California recommends that california recommends that I personally have very low tolerance when it comes to most things so if you're like me I would definitely recommend starting with 5 milligrams when it comes to edibles but I mean you've been doing it you've been using medical using marijuana medically for two years yes so her tolerance is pretty high so we can handle the 30 we just say no problem but the big thing is though from let's let's go ahead and actually break this down but the main thing that I'm getting from these is but from trying both of them it is quite herbal forward the the flavor is there the strawberry is much sweeter and more flavorful I would say than the pineapple pineapple is a little more herbal forward as well but let's actually start talking about our rating categories here and give these are actually solid score each [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] we're also gonna open this GSC previously known as Girl Scout cookies for those of you have been in the game a little longer and actually know the OG strings we're gonna be trying that card out today so anyways hope to catch you all later and see you in the next video like and subscribe [Music]", "tRBv42DgLsM": "hello everybody welcome back to the next episode of canada smokes my name is cody and i'm going to be your host on this journey as we check out some canadian legal cannabis products today i have another vape cartridge for you it's an interesting uh cartridge i've got it before uh it's called purple monkey it's made by a company called good supply this has around 79 percent thc it's got a fair amount of flavoring inside of it so if you're someone who likes to vape for the flavor you're really going to like one of these vapes here now the worst part about these is trying to get inside of these things these little boxes are kind of awkward so they've got a seal up top that you can bust with your fingernail you know or if you have a key or perhaps a knife if you're a redneck you might have a knife on you or if you're you have a kitty you can that has the shoots lasers out of its palms you can have it blast it run away like all the people on the beach here so and then there are these little plastic tabs on the side you push them in and then you can slide the box through all right here's our little cartridge inside once again this is the 510 cartridge the standard kind of thing you can buy 510 cartridges and batteries uh at any of the cannabis shops and they they work quite well you know these batteries will run you quite a few cartridges before they start to kind of lose their capacity they don't cost very much the batteries are only about 12 15 bucks and this cartridge was uh 35 that's canadian that's not a whole lot of cash and so anyway um here you can see the the color it's a nice light color it's an indica so it's pretty light in color for the indica in all honesty a lot of them are a little darker in color now uh all you gotta do is thread it on there just like i showed you once you put it on you don't have to screw it on too tight once it's once it's seated it's just just finger tight it's good enough you don't have to crank on it real hard or anything like that and uh these like i said before these have quite a bit of flavor and so just smelling it you can you can tell already that this is going to be a a pretty nice treat so let's go ahead and let's have a pull on it here and we'll see what we think here yep very nice flavor they uh very smooth these pens they're not too bad um you don't want to blow this stuff out your nose too much it kind of burns the nose and i definitely did a little bit of that you may have noticed that i just spliced two videos together and that is true i did the reason why is well it's halfway through no october in alberta and uh it's starting to get cold in my 600 square foot rickety 10 box house that i live in i've got a 60s mobile home that i live in and the walls are about as thick as a modern day hard wall trailer without the insulation so my furnace comes on a lot and uh it wrecked my previous video it did it sounded like absolute crap as it was blasting through so i decided that i would uh re-record hey canada so anyway these things are nice i like these cartridges and these pens these vape pens um they're a good little unit they don't make a lot of smell you can smoke these kind of more discreetly than you you could a joint if you're to burn up a big fatty and combust some flour that makes quite a bit of smell your fingers smell and all that now the worst thing is just try to get away from the red eyes no obviously you can use a lot of visine but i don't know how good that is for you either so that's kind of the telltale sign is some squinty eyes anyway um yeah you know if you're you're traveling through and you're curious about picking up one of these pens i highly recommend that you can rate yourself up for about fifty dollars and you've got a nice little little smoking pen there and um that'll last you for you know let's say a day and a half maybe two days depending on how much you smoke i know people that can make them last longer won't name any names of course um so yeah they're decent that's about all i have to say about that uh if you have any recommendations as to what you'd like to see me try please drop them there in the comments hit like maybe a sub that'd be cool check me out this is the third video going big time here maybe going to do a fourth video right away so appreciate everyone following me checking me out here um it's a lot of fun to be able to go down to the store and just pick up some some products off the shelf without having to try and find someone you know and uh make sketchy connections and sketchy places just for a little bit of chronic you know it's it's quite nice so it's one thing i'll give a little bit of credit to our prime minister for is uh the man has pretty much given us this market here that i don't think would have existed under uh a different government so there you go it's what as political as all i'm willing to get in any of these videos um yeah the the canadian legal market isn't terrible some of these vials these cartridges are down at reasonable in in price and they're decent in quality and if you're interested go out and grab one please always drive safely don't ever drive impaired enjoy cannabis responsibly keep it out of the reach of children don't smoke out children or people that don't want to be around it let's be smart let's be responsible let's be classy about it alright let's not screw this up thanks for checking out my video this has been another episode of canada smokes i hope that you will join me again and we'll check out some other products in this legal market that's all i think i have for now thank you very much take care", "llkmXnsnnmA": "[Music] so I'm doing the reef kit

Michaels I miss Michaels florals are so pretty all right so I went all the way around I was feeling out when it I think when it this one goes here but it's gonna keep falling down and it's not in the right spot I might add one more right there I think I'm gonna yeah even after you know everything's open they're seeing a good year to two years up even after everything's open that you should you have to still wear masks in public and you know I don't have a problem with that I think everybody at least for the first year should wear the masks they say cuz it's coming back in the winter with a vengeance so it's like huh alright so we're just gonna cut that now you guys for this hit already have a premade bow that I already made and I thought I made one for me but I did not so I did not

thought let me just pre make them but I don't have mine pre-made so you're gonna have to watch me make it I'm so sorry but we're gonna do ribbons so you guys would have got in your kit you would got the yellow and blue there are 12 inches long and you have to dovetail them when you're cutting them they're rolled up like this each ribbon colored like this and all you have to do oh the ribbon tails up there ribbon yeah there put my brother sells them their ribbon tails yeah I'm gonna cut across the top I'm gonna put my scissors again through the middle and then cut across the top try to keep it straight I missed some apparently I wasn't in the middle and then you're gonna dovetail the ends you're just gonna put the ribbons together make sure they're lined up fold them and then cut it at an angle so you have a nice finished dovetail Oh so actually I have Halloween kits now and I was coming out with ladybug ones um but when I went to check out my stuff which took me forever to get they only have three signs so I got to find the signs um but I want to do ladybug ones and I do have Halloween ones I have all the stuff right now for Halloween I just was gonna wait a little bit to put it out but we could do Halloween Halloween's my fave do the castle in the dark I don't that's a good question they look like they would should we see all right so I just stuff tails all them and then this yellow one I'm gonna put with that just gonna set it up yeah those are nice I love him in it he did him fatter so they're super cool now all right so my brother sells craft supplies he's just starting off in his business on Etsy Facebook in YouTube is the 305 store and he sells ribbon tails these are acrylic they're super nice they're pretty thick and these are the fluorescent ones they do they do look like they would glow in the dark now I don't know I don't think so hey Murray he can't see but you'll get it they saw he saw some SS at so you get a 10 inch or 12 inch or 13 inch and a 14 inch make sure you're checking them out if you want them go to the three one five store on Facebook and message them whatever alright guys so I'm gonna do these two in every other tie I'm just gonna

days and then they closed back down then they'll be closed for a couple days but they're usually opened at least once a week you just they're only open for a short period like I said a couple days they'll get a few orders in and then they shot it back down so you just got to keep looking there and it'll usually tell you if you click the kovat thing on top click it and it'll use you can read it it'll tell you when they'll be opening back up you know so then you know it said Wednesday and they did they opened Wednesday evening and it looked this morning and they were still hoping so I don't know if they're not now but they were this morning yeah yeah I shop a lot most of my signs I shop yeah I don't you know unless I'm doing a kit I don't usually buy my science from craft outlet I pretty much just buy mesh and ribbon I usually buy all my embellishment stuff local but I am finding they have to buy some things from craft outlet like the kit stuff no normally I would have found stuff locally but I can't go anywhere in the stores are all closed so and a seam or was one of my main abolishment places Hobby Lobby Michael's but a Seymour's gone I'm so sad about that I love AC more all they were Michele really ah I almost said a bad word Halley up shoot should have placed it this morning try you guys there you can chop it deco exchange trendy tree the riche op Sims pottery there's there's so many places science gains front door personalize it by p.m. personally yours um not a country country term reefs there's so many places to shop I got pages and pages of places in the loft it's crazy I don't even know if the girls know that where that is but there is a four-page shopping thing in the lot but the main things the main place is like I might get stuff from are under albums and a different category section section where do you say you got the UH my the three one five store that's my brother's shop and it's the three one five store he's on Facebook Etsy and YouTube yes three birds nest company there's so many places like I'm like I'm going like oh my god I'm overwhelmed with thinking of all the places you can shop any I buy a lot of signs off Amazon - all you gotta do is go into Amazon and search like you know summer signs spiritual signs Halloween signs so yeah get a lot of stuff off Amazon you'd be a based Amazon has everything all right so we got all the ribbon in so let's any sign water means loft yeah blah durman's loft you know Scott's got a lot of good stuff yeah so these again are the ribbon tails from my brother's store the three one five store and um Cheryl could probably share that link if she has it all right so now we got to add the sign now these are super duper light I'm trying to figure out how I'm gonna attach the sign I didn't take it out super light things that make you go hmm now um you could probably use those cases cable adhesive months on here but I'm not a fan of them at all I know people use them I don't like them but they would probably be good for this because it's super light I think I might have to do a little drill I think I might get my drill and just draw a little hole at the top and went down at the bottom cuz I think if I staple let me try I'm gonna put fell down and staple it I'm either gonna ruin it or it's gonna work I'll let you know don't do yours yet now my felts a little thick oh I'm nervous it's gonna go through I'm so scarred maybe I should double it I'm gonna double it that sign is not that thick I'm gonna double my felt it might be too thick now I don't think my staples were that big yeah it did go through a little so I'm in a drill hole all right I don't want to do that I'm just gonna do a little hole in there um drill hold on one second goes you could probably just use a not all because he's that's super um it's not like I don't know what it is but you could probably pop right through it with a knob but I'm just gonna smell find a small small small drill bit that's pretty tiny and I was gonna drill a hole yeah Sean loves doing live some chanting you girls he loves when he shot her on showing you guys stuffing chatting you off for hours and hours he's a little camera hock alright so I'm just gonna hold this in my hand and draw at the top don't you know drill your hand I'm gonna do it right in the middle little teeny tiny bowl of it it's around that scared me I'm just gonna get my silver wire cut to pieces yeah I love him too I missed them I can't wait til we all can get together and have a gathering and hang out I have a feeling I'm gonna be in the backyard and I can't by myself most of the summer I'll be on one side of the pool and they can stay on the other and if they sneeze or cough they gotta leave no get out no no ila when that little thing that I so had that fabric felt on the back stapled and when I did the drill it's funny and it scared me and it's like what was that yeah all right so I'm just gonna come over here and I'm gonna determine where I want this and I think I'm gonna put it right here so I'm just gonna poke right down through my mesh hold her down right through grab that wire I did fail I went to Walmart because I'm a snacker you know and I could send my husband to the store he goes to the store a lot um Calif yells at me like mom you send him to store everyday I don't son mister every day every day he's saying he's going to the store so if he's gonna go I'm gonna give him a list right but he can't do a big list so I mean he does his best but he'll forget stuff and I need my snacks oh you know what he's like what do you want like I don't know what I want I don't know like I'm the type that needs to walk around the store and see what I'm in the mood for that week but yes I got snacks I got lots of cookies you know even though Kayla makes cookies she's only doing the sugar cookies I mean they're good for these are delicious but I'm not a big sugar cookie person I'm not usually a big cookie person unless they're lemon or certain cookies but yeah I got these lemon strawberry the obvi thing I got was lemon 200 this fella Dora feels like shortbread ones I love those I love shortbread cookies and anything lemon but yeah I didn't what and I so I wanted bins to firm you know organizing my supply room I picked up some bins and I'm trying to clean out that other small room because I think I'm gonna have to wrap that in shelving to to make more storage solutions alright so I got this here we're gonna put a big bowl right there so you guys already got your bow I'm so sorry I thought I made one for me too and I probably did I just don't know where it is so I'm just gonna make a ball real quick yes lemon anything girl I love I was like you know for Mother's Day can you please just make me a lemon cake she's like really I'm like yeah it's Mother's Day you can't say no like don't even think about it girlfriend all right let's see I got one two one two three so like I said you guys already have the bow you just got a reef flop it and I'm gonna show you how to reflect it let me make mine first and I'm gonna smash it down just like I did to yours uh I'm asking up we're going right yep you do you just gotta you know I'm being extra safe and washing my hands and not touching things in the store and um social distancing and getting in the car and wiping myself and all that stuff and came home and wash my hands and but you know she just got to take those extra steps and make sure you're doing them so I'm gonna do 6-inch lips oh you guys I'm just gonna make this bow because like I said these were already pre-sold in the kits so this should have already been made and I apologize so I'm just gonna hurry up and make this I'm not really gonna explain it because I'm trying to remember how I made my bows some of you guys got different bows I was gonna do them all different but then after I got a few of them different I was like now I'm just gonna be pop suppose the same now they're all sold out out I have um I have Halloween one said I'll be coming out a problem I didn't want to list them yet but I'll probably list them this week and and I'll be coming out with soon out ladybug ones so I'm gonna do 4 loops 2 loops on each side these are I am have been buying a whole bunch of them when I'm listing them because you know with people being out of jobs I wasn't sure if people were gonna be shopping for kids of course we're all home and bored to death so I just didn't want to get stuck with a lot of them so I'm only doing like for each kit 10 to 15 over man a time but you know I'm also head back to back kitchen usually so I will if you guys are interested in the Halloween ones I can just let them out for now and so that ladybug ones come and again of course you know Halloween time I'll have more cuz Halloween's my favorite I just seen it one shop and I was like oh I think I'm gonna do Halloween even though we haven't even reached summer the bedroom Boris uh they're called ribbon tails and they're for my brother he makes them in sells them the three one five store buy he's on Etsy YouTube and Facebook they're about three one five store all right hi Trina that's okay and you're never late even if you're watching the replay you're never late you're watching me so that's that's quite okay I'm gonna just do another loop on each side this is the one-two one-two bow little bit longer spray-shun tonight on now shine on he's usually jumping on to tell me make sure you tell them about the ribbon tails what's getting warm down here I turned up the heat that's okay you can like I said you guys can always catch the replay my videos are always available after my life for you to catch the replays so again make sure you're sharing those replays too

to use save ten oh thank you all well did you put that because I completely forgot Kathleen yeah you guys um also I'm so sorry I completely forgot about that he keeps telling me you guys I'm so forgetful if you go to the three one five store everything in his shop is ten percent off for the rest of the week so those ribbon tails will be ten percent off awesome Thank You Kathy I know aren't those pineapple I ordered a few extra for myself too besides the kids like you better get a couple more because you know they're there posing or once they're sold out they're sold out like I said I bought all the stuff for the kit I have everything and I had 16 signs in the car and when I went to check it out it said when they opened it said sorry there's only three science and I was like come on I searched for that stuff for hours are you kidding me why'd you let me put that meeting in my cart if there weren't that many usually tells you and it did not it's not gonna do I think I'm gonna come back on with another pineapple now some of you got it this way and some of you did not but I'm gonna do this on this one straighten the scrunchies down so they fluff up better hey Debbie hi Reese god I haven't seen her in a while but she's got to be getting bigger they grow so fast like I know I mean I don't personally know her body you know you send me pictures she's so cute in writer I miss my little writers so bad I mean I'm sure Cheryl misses the crap out of them cuz it's her grandchild but you know when we FaceTime I only see a little writer I love him all right so did I do yellow I did green pink so let's do that dark turquoise and a little bit of yellow and then weird done with my bow okay so I'm just gonna do this down here twist so I'm only gonna do one loop on each side I have a feeling I'm probably gonna have to reschedule my um event my camp meet and greet which is I mean I'll definitely let you know June first if that's gonna be rescheduled um but it's not really looking that well but we'll see I'm still hopeful bring that down all right sorry guys let me grab just gonna grab a big pipe cleaner so I'm just gonna pick this up and twist it off oh really I know that's what I would I can't wait to beat grandma I just know by the time I'm a grandma I'm wouldn't be like and I wanted to be the young grandma that played with them not the old one that just gave them money inside you're so adorable and I'm almost at that old age like all right I don't got that much energy anymore all right so you guys let me uh that's right I want to I'm gonna fluff it then I went a magic the way you got it so hold on cuz that's how I did it when I packed them so I can show you cuz again if you've never done a bow you're gonna be like huh she's Smosh turbo which is okay everything is reflex wired ribbon and get it all in place all right so I went and fluffed your bows and then I matched him so I could put him in your box because you guys got the bows already pre-made for you so the only thing you're gonna do you guys is just grab the back of it and we're just gonna fluff from the yellow so we're going to start with the yellow and they're gonna go off to the sides just like this yellows going off to the side and then you're gonna have a pink going in between or one above and one below the yellow and then again so the two and a half inch is in the middle and yours gonna have a one and a half on each side and that's how you're gonna do it all the way up two and a half in the middle one and a half on the sides okay and you're just gonna keep repeating that all the way up and fluffing it pull your tails downwards if they want to keep going up like that you're gonna grab them don't be afraid make sure your bow is nice and tight or you're gonna grab these because they're gonna keep doing that and pull them hold your middle ribbon the one that it keeps going up over and pull it under pull it down because it's gonna want to keep going back up that way and that way they'll stay down okay I'm gonna do the same thing to this one pulling it down just hold your bow and then pull your tails down cuz they do want to keep doing that alright so again you got your two and a half we're gonna put a one and a half on each side of it that's not near the same length so I'm just gonna adjust it a little by pulling on it this one's way short okay okay alright then again the two and a half up in the middle and a one and a half on each side two and a half in the middle don't be afraid to really yank on them to get them where you want them and then these two we only did one loop so you can just pull one up and one in the middle let's get this fluffed and you should have mo you just gotta fluff it just you know shape out your loop skin and wear you like um you should have got a nice festive bow so just gonna come over here now you guys I don't like an opening in my grease and I always forget this when I pack in these but if you want you can attach a pipe cleaner crossbar and put mesh attached mesh to that Center that way you know if you have something that you're placing like your bow it's not dipping down in that hole but I think mine's gonna be fine and I don't know why I made that long I should have made this long like I did with all yours and I didn't so I'm just gonna make this longer I don't know what I was thinking I always use the EZ bow maker the EZ bow maker is so easy to use guys like I don't watch videos I I just make bows I I don't like like I love the Pro Bowl the hand I think it's awesome but I have to watch a video to know how to use it and when then I seen someone using the EZ bow maker a lot of breeze makers were using them and I bought it and I just put it you can you know see exactly what it is you're doing so and then I just started making bows and now I make those all the time so this is gonna go right down the side of your wreath right down the sign of your sign I should say sure my ribbon stop twisting back here you're just gonna reach rate you're gonna determine where you want it I want the top of my bowl pretty much to be right with my sign I do like my ribbons to hang a little bit on my sign so I don't want over too far kinda almost right on top and I am eventually gonna pull a roll in there you should do that with a crossbar but I'm just gonna poke right now through my mesh determine where I want my bow I'm my pipe cleaner stuck because I twisted it and it's snagging on the mesh I always get my pipe cleaners from a craft outlet but you could probably find them somewhere else you know use your 40% coupon and I usually stock up on them thank God but I'm stuck guys hold on my pipe cleaner all right wasn't going all the way through all right so I'm just gonna I got a look in stand up gonna go ahead and attach it right yup yup when i AC morris was closing guys i got bags of zipped of course pipe cleaners i mean they only had orange but I got like freakin I got oh my god I got like 20 bags of orange pipe cleaners and about 50 rolls of ribbon and one of those round metal then I showed that my life that I keep ribbons in that it's got the spinning in the wheels that they use for their stuff to hold things I got that in like 50 rolls of ribbons and like 20 things of pipe cleaners for $20 the very last day they were closing they called me in like you got to come pick up all the stand you bought and I was like what they're like we're closing today and like are you kidding I've been calling you guys for two weeks to come get those and you keep telling me now and you're literally giving me like a 20-minute notice they're like yep like okay alright and then you're just gonna adjust your tails minor quite long I'm just gonna go ahead and make sure I'm separating so there's each color on each side we don't want the same now I doubled my pineapple so there's two on each side oops missed nagging alright so I'm gonna go ahead and trim the tails now if you guys like longer shorter tails it's totally totally up to you the length or you could just leave them the way they are and dovetail it and I think in my group you guys I think I had a hundred in my design group so I'll be doing a MIMO giveaway I'm gonna make it a contest though I'm not just gonna pick a name and you I'm gonna make it fun and do like a contest for it but one of you will be winning amiibo in my design group I told the girls a long time ago when I got to 100 I would do amiibo giveaway and they've been waiting that long and I think we hit there it's just not reading yet because a lot of people a few people haven't asked to get in yet I'm just gonna make these ones a little bit shorter I kind of want them a little stacked a little bit a little bit alright so you're just gonna duck tell your your tails to Tullius that you are on it and I always like to just give these a little curl with my fingers just like take them and roll them under this one's too long let me go too and I popped a little pink through this because there is pink writing on the sign so we pop some pink in with the wreath form on the sign in in the ribbon but I didn't want it to be too much pink in there because I wanted to look more you know with the yellows in the blues now we just need to add our pineapples so you would have got this right in your kit and you're just going to I'm just gonna cut this whole thinks I don't need it that long I'm just gonna cut that I'm actually gonna make this one a little shorter so you got your two sprays and honestly you guys you could put these wherever you want but I think I'm gonna do one off over here to the side so I'm just gonna I'm just gonna wrap this I'll hit it with hot glue I don't got my glue gun on and I want it to stand out more so I'm gonna put it down now remember if you're shipping these the more it stands up the higher your boxes I would just push it down and let the people know when they get it that they can just pull it back up it's all wired it'll stand right back up but you know if you're gonna ship it and it's standing that high up it's gonna be like a 14-inch box and I think I'm just gonna put one up here coming out near the bow and I'm just trying to get the rain spa and again I'll hit this with glue I don't got my I forgot to turn the glue gun on actually when I wrapped up right here gonna wrap it right now with my thinking here but you never know I might move it went up towards the top but you could put yours wherever you want and that is the pineapple reef kits and you could add to yours guys this is just what I gave in the kit you can add more stuff to it if you want and really you could really make this so much more but you know the more I keep adding to them the more those kids are crossing so cuz trust me I could go crazy great great I'm just gonna straighten these out turn it around for ya so yeah I'll show you really quick the UM the Halloween one but I am gonna be having a B one out probably by the end of the week not this week next week by next week I'll have a ladybug one out hopefully I'm just gonna have to order the sign somewhere else but that is it I want this in the middle wasn't it goat thank you I can't I like my tails always hanging a little bit on the side [Music] my straight can you guys see that my two close up [Music] it's adorable I do need to move I think I'm gonna drill a hole right on this side so I can keep this pulled over a little more because it wants to keep leaning inwards and you know what it might also do I well I don't want to cover the wording but you can also put this sign on the opposite side in the bow on this side so it's not covering up the pineapple it really depends on you know if you want what side you want the bow on it's totally up to you though doot it's cute and like I said I can see the hole I can see the hole in the center and I'm just not a huge fan hole so I'll probably add a crossbar in that center part and put like over some tenon shop ruffles in there just to I sold ups that both stays the way I wanted to sometimes that hole on makes the them move a little bit and not stay exactly where you want them to so you just do a crossbar with pipe cleaners and then you have something to connect to in the middle of your reads right it's very summery now I do wish those phrase came with three pineapples on it because I'd like to do things in at least by threes because I would have probably put another pineapple down here so it would have been around the sign or you could just have them exploding out of your bowl it's totally up to you where you put them but yeah I think they're cute I love pineapple themed grace I don't know why the pineapple ornaments I got at craft outlet oh you have an attempted one yet Jenny girl when she started read you're gonna be addicted and want to make a moms time then you're gonna be blaming me for your shopping addiction to ribbon it's gonna be on my fault that you spent all your money at the craft store don't blame it on me okay it's not my fault it's not my fault I'm saying it out alright guys I really appreciate you guys following watching and sharing me you guys are so great I hope you're all staying safe I'll be live Wednesday and don't forget on the weekends I do have my girls in my design group go live on my large entry throne page on Facebook so you know I'm hoping you guys jump on there I'm trying to help them build up their followers and subscribers just like me you know and in our community of support so I'm trying to support them and help their channels to grow and I appreciate you guys watching and sharing them also in like in their pages you guys are so awesome at that and they love you all I hope you all stay safe and I will see you when I see you", "rUScX_Qlvq4": "today I'd like to do a quick how-to video pertaining vape pens and specifically a vape pen that utilizes a prefilled cartridge so this one in particular is from pure hemp botanicals and you can purchase this one of two ways you have this prefilled cartridge this is has the CBD in it for you you could purchase this cartridge by itself and that would be a perfect option for those that already have a vaping device at home so people that already have some sort of vape pen vape battery bait mod now the key there is that this cartridge fits on a 5-10 thread that is what that's referring to it's called a 5-10 thread so as long as you have a 5-10 thread you could put this on your personal vape device if you do not already have a personal vape device of any sorts then you can purchase this as a kit off of pure hid botanicals calm so as a kit you would get your pen slash battery because this part is rechargeable you would get your prefilled cartridge and you would get the USB that recharges this pen for you so that's what comes in the kit and the way that this works is you just take the cartridge place it on top of your pen slash battery you just screw that right on there and to turn the pen on you're gonna click it five times in a row one two three four five you'll see that blue came right on that is indicating that it's on and ready you are going to simply press this button and inhale at the same time as you're pressing the button this is what is heating up the cartridge for it to vaporize so that's how the mechanics of how that works and I will do a little demonstration so you can do whatever feels good to you if it feels good to do a long draw if it feels good to do maybe a couple of light draws in a row whatever is feeling good you'll know it's working for you there's a lot of different style of pens I do like that this one has a button because I feel like it gives it a little bit more of temperature control but any pen that is 510 thread will work with this if you if you find that your pen is dying or it is dead all you do is you take your USB piece you're going to screw that right in and then you could put this directly into your computer if you do have a USB port in your computer you could use something like this this is just from my phone and I would just put that directly in there and then plug it into the wall and it will recharge for me so that's how that works and as far as taking care of your pin you want to be mindful of not to keep it in high heat like you wouldn't want to keep it in a hot car it's just making it so it's more likely to leak or have problems um if you do ever find that something sticky or leaking I just clean mine with a little bit of rubbing alcohol from around the house super easy keeps it all clean and nice and then it is a common if so for instance like I've had this I've had this cartridge for a while I've gotten lots of uses out of it and I still have a ton of oil left um but it's common for the oil to change color over exposure to light and even heat so you know this started off a little bit of a lighter color and over time it's gone a little bit darker that's nothing to be concerned about that's totally normal it doesn't mean the oil is bad by any means so this one was cool because I chose caramel which is one my favorite flavors of terpenes that they offer but you could choose any other terpene that sounds good to you you can get this device at pure hemp botanicals calm and you can use my coupon code for friends and family which is Lanie 15 and that will save you 15% its la whaai in IE one five and you go you can put that coupon code in and um what a lot of people are interested in in this product for and what a lot of people are using it for is that

out of this Pease love Lanie ganja", "FgCI7PNWV28": "hey guys it is wednesday november 2nd welcome back on the pursuit of wealth it's rod with pal group and in today's video we're going to do some product reviews i just ordered a 500 order from hexo on the albertacanvas.org website and i'll go through what my thoughts are on those products and what those products are but before we jump into today's video make sure to hit the like subscribe tick the bell and you'll be notified on any future product reviews i'll also jump over to a few news articles that came up today and we'll do a little bit of analysis here on hexo as well so stick around and we'll jump right into it [Music] all right so welcome back the products that i ordered so i have the i ordered a bunch of vapes so i got the granddaddy purple which is their new product and new strain that they have available in the vapes it was fantastic also got the fire og the tangie or pretty sure it's pronounced tangy and blue dream so pretty excited about that and also ordered i love all of their vapes by the way some of them are just vaped cartridges so you put them on your existing mod or the battery and i bought a couple of disposable ones as well but uh also ordered some of the very well cbd drops and this is really cool the packaging is really cool as well so you just twist it this comes off and you just take the cover off and you dip it into any beverage so you can put it directly into your water it's water soluble and i love it it's awesome especially for the xmg order these as well the thc drops which is from truss beverage corp which is the um the joint venture with molten cores and hexo so these contain thc drops you just drop it in any i put it in my tea my water you can put it in the existing cannabis beverages so if you buy a cannabis beverage from the store and it's only got five milligrams of thc or 10 milligrams of thc and you're somebody like me who requires a lot more than that you can add that to it and voila problem solved so what else did i order i ordered some of the up so they came out with some news yesterday that the up brand is they're repositioning it as 20 and above so it's guaranteed that every time you order from this brand the up brand it will be always above 20 thc so this one's the northern berry indica flower three and a half grams that one was really good i enjoyed it smells and tastes exactly like berry and i also ordered the cold creek kush and this one's my favorite the high from it is absolutely awesome it's you're very creative i found it you know i didn't get too lazy which you normally do on a indica kush type flower so really recommend this one and like i said if you're into berry or the fruitier type that one has a lot of nice terpenes as well so i also ordered some of the original stash hash which i really enjoy it's 2 grams and it'll last a long long time it reminds me of whenever i was a kid used to getting it from down the road from from your guy but i highly recommend the hash as well it's my second time buying it the smoke is super clean it's not harsh on the on the throat at all i really enjoyed it i highly recommend that one and probably my favorite is the os click train wreck so let me show you guys this product i didn't even know these existed and i'm pretty sure hexo has the second most patents of any canadian producer out there but essentially you just take it out of the package and it looks like a little pen and what it is is it's distillate so it has you can ingest it or you can inhale it so you can use it as a dab rig you can put it into a dab you can um you could roll it onto a joint i guess you could put it in some ice cream there's so many different ways to do it but it's cool you just pop this little edge this cap off here and they have pretty sure this is a patented technology but you can see here you just rotate this and once it clicks it drops a perfect amount which they categorize as 40 clicks and it drops a perfect droplet every time and you can so let's say you're doing a dab rig and you have the the bowl there you heat that up with your blowtorch you can put that directly into the dab rig it's a metal end here as well so this is just absolutely genius in my opinion because you can dab it right onto the rig and there's no need to even touch it and it's super clean the terpenes are fantastic i'll bring up the website here in a minute that shows the description of this as well but i really really like this product i think it's absolutely incredible and the branding on the original stash so the original stash hash i also have the original stash 220 which is the indica it's about a 24 thc it was only 112 dollars for a full ounce and that's what these are so the original stash hash the original stash 220 indica they have a bunch of other flour as well and then the os clicks they have three different types of strains and it's just brilliant in my opinion it's the original stash they have the hash now they have the distillate and the dabber so you can you can basically get anything from this you can get flower you get hash you can get your dabs you can and and it's the original stash which is their black market competitor and brand uh that they're using to compete with the illicit market so i think the branding is absolutely fantastic i i can't get over how much i love these products super impressed with the os click hopefully you guys find as much enjoyment and uh just overall satisfaction with it as i do all right so taking a look at some news articles and some charting i also want to bring up a picture here of my order so like i said i ordered about a 500 order ordered it on monday off the alberta cannabis dot org website and it was here tuesday morning so huge huge order and it was delivered in no time so very very speedy delivery so if you are in alberta they are on the ball and like i said i ordered a lot of hexo products these were i just wanted to try the xmg drops the very well cbd drops i hadn't tried these um these bran these strains of their up cannabis as well i already tried the hash but i wanted to order a little bit more of those i wanted to try the os click which is really cool and i didn't try these three vape cartridges or the blue dreams so just trying out all of their products so far i love their products i love their packaging i love their branding everything about it is just fantastic so i order a lot of their beverages as well and personally i stopped drinking alcohol for a while and that's awesome because you can buy a molo now which is makes it very easy to do because you can still have that beer still feel like you're socializing and fitting in and you wake up and you don't have that hangover as well so um and now we have the xmg drops you can drop thc drops in any drink that you have or you can add it to an existing cannabis beverage to make it more potent so we'll take a look at the albertacannabis.org website i just want to show you a couple of their products here as well but if you just take a look at if you search hexo and this will come up but everything about it like their products their packaging their their branding they have something for everybody it's just it looks like super it looks so professional compared to a lot of other uh lps that are out there and honestly they have something for everybody their brands are fantastic my girlfriend really likes the limonene and tonic sparkling beverage so it basically kind of reminds her of champagne and it's uh it's easily replaced and it tastes amazing i really like that one as well the mercin's nice to combine with food i really like the dark sparkling dark cherry as well in the little victory molo is my favorite the cbd drinks the very well cbd drinks are really good as well tropical fruits probably my favorite of the xmgs the tropical mango i just did a video review on that one you can check that video out on my channel but that one was good too but i give that one about an eight and the tropical a nine out of ten and they have a bunch of different flowers as well packaging really nice on those tried the disposable vape pens those are only 19 bucks so very affordable they're three and a half grams are now only 22 dollars so that's you know competing with black market prices they're up cold creek cush in northern berry the two that i ordered are only 27 and they're really really good like i said it was uh it was a good high it give it's a nice calming and creative high as well and didn't completely knock me you know on the couch or anything so taking a look at a few more so i ordered the cbd drops here those were sixty dollars ordered some hash which is two grams for thirty eight dollars the xmd drops the thc drops are very affordable as well only thirty eight dollars and the vape cartridges are only 27.99 and they last a while too so i want to show you guys the os click as well but just looking at their original stash flower they have a lot of options here as well and only 109.99 so 109.99 for a full ounce 28 grams of indica they're sold out of the sativa and they they usually are because it's fantastic i can't wait to get my hands on some of that again but just taking a look i want to show you guys this is the os click train wreck that i ordered it's 59.99 so just taking a look at the description here so exclusive to canada os click is an easy to use distillate dosing pen for dabbing and other concentrated uses the os click applicator provides consumers with precision dose control and a mess-free portable and discreet concentrate experience each audible click from the applicator display dispenses 25 milligrams of os click train wreck a hybrid cannabis distillate featuring terpenes including limonene humeline and karyo phelan that's a difficult one to say say that five times fast don't get tripped up the distillate can be inhaled or ingested and does not contain any additives you your pesticides you got the idea heavy metals distillates terpenes just each os click applicator will dispense approximately 40 clicks so again 40 clicks it's just it's a awesome product it's an awesome brand i love the original stash brand they now have the concentrate they have the hash they have the flour they've got their elixir the spray the cbd drops the thc drops they literally have something for everybody even in the beverage category they have something for everybody they have a beer replica they have a champagne or a cooler just really cool they have the more potent and tastier options in the xmgs as well so looking at some news and articles from today the united nation approved the world health organization recommendation to reschedule cannabis in historic vote so this came in at a vote 27 to 25 and the united nations commission of narcotic drugs on wednesday accepted a world health organization recommendation to remove cannabis and cannabis resin from schedule 4 of the 1961 single convention on narcotic drugs so positive news looks like we're making history also saw a article from seeking alpha symbolic day for cannabis setting up with the house vote on tap so tomorrow could be a historic day for the cannabis sector if the house representative votes to approve the more act on cannabis legalization as expected while the bill will be almost surely blocked by mitch mcconnell in the senate there is still some focus on the vote on the vote according to cohen so is saying keep an eye out for the legislation changes and it basically takes a long time for these things to pass and the fact that it did so in two or three years is absolutely phenomenal and extraordinary stocks to watch a fria hexo aurora tilray canopy organogram cushco green thumb true leaf cura leaf kronos and they named some etfs there as well and just taking a look at hexo on the day here so we were at 111 we're at 110 we have above average volume at 30 million the average volume is now at 34 million just a couple of days ago i think that was around 10 million and it has grown significantly in the last few days but we're seeing huge record volume on hexo and share price well over a dollar again this may be the last time that you could accumulate this below one dollar and again this isn't a buy or sell recommendation this is for educational and entertainment purposes only but as you can see we had a bit of a hourly inverse head and shoulders here we also have a couple uptrend lines to be watching this white one here on the hourly and drew this yellow one on the daily so and then one dollar psychological obviously going to be extremely important and we were scheduled to have a vote next week about the reverse split so we'll see if on the 11th if that actually gets passed i know a lot of people just from what i'm seeing online have voted against it i know i'm against it i think that they can rebound without a reverse split and once the market makers and the you know the the institutions and the people that are holding the stock down and accumulating the stock the big big money in the space once they start try uh stop trying to keep this stock down it's going to explode like you wouldn't believe because you can tell that it's being manipulated they're running it up into after hours and overnight they dipped it down on the earnings reaction and then skyrocketed 100 in a couple of days and like i said these huge swings in the after hours they're just really making it difficult for retail to get involved and they're really making it emotional and doing a good job with that volatility and just not making it easy for the average retail investor to get involved so we're holding that uptrend line here that white uptrend line as well and just clearing that out here you can see a little bit of an hourly inverse head and shoulders we're holding ema 26 as support so we'll look to change the hourly trend you can see with a low high higher low we need a break above the 123 level to confirm an hourly trend change and if we can confirm that hourly trend change then we'll be confident that the daily higher low is set but we do have a daily inside bar on watch as well so we'll be looking at a tightening range and no daily higher low from all the way down at about 71 cents we are still daily overbought taking a look at the hourly hourly is cooled down now as well so it looks like we could potentially be due for another rip and like i said just keeping an eye on those trend changes on the five minute looks like we're in a five minute uptrend with a low high higher low higher high so we did break to a higher high so we're now in a five minute uptrend so it looks like the hourly higher low is now set at a dollar five so again we're we're maintaining the one dollar range it has now been two trading days it's basically one and a half trading days so if we finish the day above a dollar today that'll be two days in a row finishing and never dipping below one dollar so it's starting to look good it's got a lot of positive momentum the macd is blasting off on the daily as well taking a look at the weekly we do have an upper wick forming but huge volume definitely going to exceed the previous record volume from the previous earnings reaction back on in june in the summer but we do have earnings coming up on december 16th as well so it's going to be it's going to be a really good earnings report in my opinion we do have ema 12 looking across bullish we have so many bullish indicators so we'll go through them here daily and macd is skyrocketing we have the weekly rsi not even close to overbought yet we have ema 12 looking across bullish through ema 26 we back tested the bollinger band and on the daily as well and we're finding support there at the top of that band uh on the monthly we're in a monthly uptrend we just need to get above ema 12 resistance which is at a dollar 23 then we have nothing until 187 which is ema26 we're in a monthly uptrend so i'll just extrapolate this here for you guys so you can see we have a low high higher low higher high we are now in a monthly uptrend the first time since the all-time high and really no resistance on the monthly here if we can get above ema 12 and ema 26 really no resistance until all the way up to the all-time highs so we could be due for a huge explosive move on the weekly chart we're in a weekly uptrend as well with a low high higher low we have 73.71 so low high higher low higher high weekly uptrend we're in a daily uptrend taking a look at the four hour we're in a four-hour uptrend just looking for a four-hour higher low and forming a base of support there off ema 2012 on the four-hour most important resistance the most important resistance in the short term is going to be 144 and like i said just looking to change that hourly trend so most short the most important short term resistance is going to be the hourly chart of the dollar 23. we can get over that we look to 144 and then 150 and nothing really on that after that 150 2 psychological so i could see this easily hitting two dollars especially if we see more positive momentum from the vote you can see we're growing a little bit here now it's uh trending up again we're at a dollar eleven and like i said almost at yesterday's volume and just take a look at the volume and this is huge so we had 112 million on the 30th yesterday we had 140 million shares traded and today we're at 30 million shares traded so we'll expect the daily bounce to continue if we can change this hourly trend we need to change that hourly trend to be confident though so that's where we stand still in a five minute uptrend we'll continue to monitor this we'll look at the 15 minute as well so the 15 minute we had some inside bar bull breaks and you'd say we changed the trend there as well not really a whole lot of a pullback so here we had 111 110. so we pulled back about a penny and set those higher lows i'd like to see a little bit more of a pullback maybe a pullback to 109 108 and then break to a higher high and then be more confident on that but we'll continue to zoom out we'll zoom out once we change the 15 minute trend we zoom out to the hourly once we change the hourly we zoom out everything else though is in an uptrend so if we can get the hourly back to an uptrend it's going to be it's going to be very very good for the bulls so that's where we stand on the hexo chart again on the weekly we are above the 10 week moving average we the macd and stochastic are blasting off and extremely bullish taking a look at the daily so we did have a golden cross confirmed today with the 50 moving average at 75 cents and the 200-day moving average at 74. so we did cross that golden cross and the 100 is looking to cross through the 200 as well and again on the weekly we're above the 50 week moving average nothing until the 100 up at 283 but again if we can get above the 129 cent level there's nothing really until 144 and 150 and two dollars psychological so that's what we can expect again we'll see some more positive momentum if we see more votes from the house and some positive developments there but other than that that's pretty much all i have in terms of charting that's going to do it for today's video thanks again for joining us on the pursuit of wealth for another product review make sure to hit the like subscribe hit the bell you'll be notified on any future updates i'll see you in the next video", "IcGqieIeZWo": "hey guys trevor here with ready leaf and today we're going to be diving into the last general emission cart that i have to try their berry g33 strain is definitely one i've heard interesting things about and have a real excitement to dive into and try it out this indica dominant vape from general mission is going to be their thc dominant let's get into it and try it out you guys cheers and i'll see you on the other side of this intro welcome back you guys so as i said in the intro we're going to be getting into the berry g33 vape cartridge from general emission this is going to be their one two zero thc cbd cross so it is the pure thc cartridge that they've released on that indica dominant effect the thc total that came in with this one is nice and high at the 87.4 percent the cbd total is at the 0.74 we've got a package date of september 6 2020. and the price for this sucker is going to be 39.99 for the 0.45 gram card these aren't a half gram they're just shy of that but um i don't have any specific information based off of this cart but we are just gonna quickly cover the cartridges that i have tried the three other cartridges that i have tried from general emission and we're gonna kind of rank them in uh in order so there was a tropic thunder which was a two to one cart you had a lemon ice which was a one to one card and then a tropic girl scout cookies which would be a pure thc cartridge but sativa dominant and because we've got our indica dominant one here personally i really really fell in love with the tropic girl scout cookies and the lemon ice cartridge from general mission the flavor and just the overwhelming effect that it came on with was nice and strong very smooth the flavor was potent all the way until the very end like all in all it was just a great and very enjoyable experience through both that tropic girl scout cookies and the lemon ice cartridge now when it comes to tropic thunder i enjoy it i've still got a little bit of it left it's just not as enjoyable when it's compared to the other two the other two are just definitely by far the winners for my personal preference and i'm quite curious to see if this berry g33 is gonna be one that'll pop off and go along with it or if it's gonna be a little bit of the lighter tasting lighter effects but the only way we get to find out about that is if we uh crack this container open and get into it so that's what i'm going to do i'm going to break this security seal on here we're going to go ahead and get the urban scale intro in here for you guys before we go ahead and dive into this cart cheers and i'll see you over there [Music] welcome back you guys so we've got the urban scale intro down and over with we've got the cartridge out of the box we'll put that just down there for now let's get these plastic coatings off here and get it onto our vuber battery so the way we are going to do these reviews and the way we typically do our reviews is we are going to be taking a dozen hauls off of this cartridge first and foremost you guys we absolutely will get to experience all the different flavors and um experiences that this bud not bud but cartridge has to offer and typically general emission is really really high grade enjoyable enjoyable smooth smoke but to get to that dozen halls you guys we take three through the uber battery first we run it through each of the three temperatures on here and then we do the exact same thing through the g pen they each get an individual score out of ten and then we go ahead and we take a half a dozen more rips so three through the mover three to the g pen same way we did it before running through all three temperatures through our two glass rigs right here we've got the 420 rig and the mad hatter one in the back we rock it through there and we give it a score out of ten and then we finish it up by talking about the high giving not a score out of 10 for a total out of 40. you guys we're looking to get into that beautiful herbage but the only way we're gonna do that is if this cartridge performs and really impresses me so let's uh go ahead and find out if it's gonna do that let's make sure ah make sure we start out on the lowest and work our way up up to the highest temperature you guys enough talking time to start smoking cheers and let's see how this first taste of the berry g33 vape cartridge is let's go okay it's got an interesting transitional kind of a fight for you guys so at first i get a very nice and strong and very nice and strong but light in the sense of it being kind of a humid based flavor so it's very watered down it's strong in the intensity but watered down in the flavor that i'm getting if that makes sense of this lemongrass light flavor that sits on my tongue and then it transitions into this almost more floral like picking raspberries but not eating raspberries kind of experience where you're getting that combination of the green and the sweet and the sugar in the air like that's that's really the experience i found with uh that first temp you guys so we're gonna go ahead and run it through the second temperature and see if we get a more intense experience for those two flavors or if it's gonna stay right around the same cheers you guys okay guys so again didn't transition very much from that original flavor from that kind of watery lemongrass experience and then the transition into kind of the leafy airy raspberry picking kind of experience you guys there's a little bit more carry to it so i'm definitely getting more of that lemongrass and berry combination lingering than i did the first one and i definitely think that that that second temperature might be a winner if the high is the highest temperature just a little bit too much and it's more so for that carry of flavor than anything else here we go let's adjust the mic placements that you guys hopefully have a little bit clearer and a little bit louder sound but for now we're gonna go ahead and uh take our rip with the highest temp you guys and then we'll be back with the score before we dive into the g pad cheers and i'll see on the other side seven out of ten you guys that's what the boober batter's gonna end up getting all right and honestly it's i'm giving it a seven more so because i can't give it a six i have more reasons to not give it a six than i do to necessarily give it a seven and i don't know if that that makes any sense to you guys but let me just explain it so if i go through and i'm looking honestly with most of the sevens they're gonna be i don't have enough information or i don't have enough of a score to give him uh eight and i've got too much of a score to give him a six because that seven is really that that buffer between enjoyable and uh kind of that plus right big thing that is selling me this cartridge for that that seven is the length of carry of the flavor afterwards i am still experiencing that flavor and it built up over those three three rips that i've got a nice little carry of that kind of light raspberry light lemongrass flavor and i'm enjoying that quite a bit that's the selling point right there but the flavor on the original draw wasn't strong enough to really get me to enjoy that experience of it so that's why i can't give it an eight and that overwhelming lengthy hold of the flavor is purely why i can't give it a six you guys so that it's not a it's um plus with a little bit of an extra addition to it and that's where those sevens end up creeping in there um but we have it on our g pen we have the blue button ready to go which is the lowest for this guy let's start it out here work our way through see if this gets a 7 or if it's going to work its way into that eight category or maybe down into a six we don't know until we get through let's go ahead and try that with you guys okay biggest biggest notice and biggest noticeable difference that's a better way to put it biggest noticeable difference between this cartridge on the g pen and on the boober is draw the size of the ports on the g pen make this this va holy man okay give me a second let me let me gather my thoughts and try that again the bigger ports on the g pen make it easier to draw than on the vuber the uber was nice and it provided a really intense flavor but it had the smaller port so it was harder harder to draw through holy [ __ ] you guys this this cartridge is affecting my speech today we're definitely going to be giving a decent score on the high um the ports were harder to draw through and it made it a lot more of an intense smoke on the lungs so the cough and everything along those lines was a little bit more intense and a little bit of a removal of the enjoyment with that uber body where the g pen more air movement seemed to be a smoother draw and just seems to be the more enjoyable first draw we're gonna go ahead and take the second draw you guys and see if it's comparable or if it's going to be be the place that we really enjoy this cartridge you guys but for the zombie let's get into it okay guys so we've uh gotten through the second rep and i'm sad to see but that theory i've got and for those who haven't been here and heard it before let's just keep it short in these cartridges the tanks that typically heat the oil so where the the inner portion where you actually have that cotton and those little holes that'll hold roughly about 0.15 of the oil in these cartridges so for this that's a third hold a third of the oil every time i hit the button it heats that third worth of the cartridges oil up and every time you heat it you go ahead and you start to break down those terpenes and you start to break down the flavors and the effects of this this cartridge this one's starting to have that breakdown happen already you guys and we're not all the way through and it i really i noticed it the first haul through the g-pad and that my last one the flavor just is was not anywhere near as intense as the first hall and i'm kind of concerned that this one's gonna be continuing working down that road which is a bit of a disappointment because so far none of the general admission cards did that to me until this one so let's see if it'll recover or uh if we're just gonna have more of that deterioration of flavor you guys let's dive in and find out cheers okay so we went from that really light lemongrass kind of raspberry field combination it did have hints of that right at the beginning and then that [Music] that raspberry field is is there but it's not strong it's not overwhelming it's just kind of light and that lemongrass seems to be almost more of a citronella like it's got a lot more kick to it a lot more kind of herbal hold and and hold to it that i'm enjoying but it's not the same as it was through the uber and it was a little bit disappointing but when we go and we add the ports and the smoother draw and the smoother experience the experience was more enjoyable that way where the flavor experience wasn't the smoking experience was more enjoyable the flavor experience was not the uber it was the opposite way around flavor experience was there smoking experience was give or take so i'm gonna keep it consistent you guys i'm gonna give it a seven um because i think if i had smoking smoking if i'd smoked this cartridge through the g pen first or just exclusively through the g pen it probably would have gotten an eight so if that's the thought that i have i should probably just keep it within reason you guys um and honestly it's not that i didn't enjoy it through the jeep and it just the flavor's starting to break down and that's a little bit of a disappointment for me but we've got our uber battery here we've got our mad hatter rig ready we run through these three rips i don't typically sit down and talk about a mom going through we just get them through then we talk about it before we move on into the next battery so that you guys get to hear how each do individually before we score them as a group and we'll get into that high and we'll wrap this video up but uh for being halfway i'm enjoying this one quite a bit you guys it's definitely not my favorite cartridge so far by general mission and i don't think it will get into the top two but i think it's in the top three i think it's got that bronze medal pretty well locked down but let's see how it does to the glass before we guarantee that cheers [Music] okay that was first let's take that second down [Music] okay now we're going into this last one we preheat it because why not we gotta experience this as many different ways as we can so two clicks preheat that sucker and dive in okay guys so the uh the vuber battery through the mad hatter rig honestly it was really enjoyable and it actually had a decent amount of flavor to it but it was definitely the broken down flavor in comparison to what we originally had so this flavor that we're getting kind of hints at and lean to with the uh the breaking down is really finding me thinking of like a lemonade not a lemonade but like a lemon iced tea really because that that citronella flavor is really potent in there and then you just get kind of this raw sweet herbal combination afterwards that with that lemon there and the kind of freshness of it it's it's got me really reminiscent of of an iced tea like a good lemon iced tea and it's it's quite sweet and quite enjoyable there so if we keep getting that flavor through here i might give it a better score because i really enjoy that flavor but that's not i don't know if that's really what they're aiming for when they put this cartridge out but let's uh go ahead run it through the three battery settings we have on the g pen with our 420 rig before we go ahead and wrap up this reviews smoking cheers you guys and uh let's work through these okay a little issue on that one afterwards but we're all good we're gonna go ahead take that second rep that iced tea flavor is really really something that's popping through you guys let's see if we get it all the way through cheers we're going to go ahead and preheat dive into the slash drip cheese okay guys so for the taste from a glass i'm gonna give it a seven out of ten honestly it it it didn't really excite me didn't really overwhelm me didn't really do anything other than just kind of a yay it tastes like iced tea um like as i was smoking through it there there really wasn't anything that enjoyable or memorable the first poll was most memorable poland if that's what it is um i'm a little bit disappointed in a cartridge but smooth just not overwhelming for flavor you guys decent little bit in there but definitely is not my first pick especially from general mission for flavor for an overall indica cartridge though for a more body based high for more of um of an easing instead of that head rush kind of effect this could be a cartridge definitely worth looking at for me though when we go into the high i'm only going to be able to give it a 6 out of a 10 and it's just purely because i'm a huge indica dominant person if you're going to come in and be primarily a body affecting type of high i need you to really be a body affecting type a behind i can't get into or really enjoy any cartridges or flowers that hint at that body effect like i hate i hate the ones where it's like oh we're just gonna sit right around your shoulders and your neck and not go all the way down your back that actually causes me to have more headaches and just feel more uptight because i feel like i'm sitting like this all day and it's not enjoyable for me to have that type of high where i'd rather have a high that hits me and it [ __ ] makes me curl my toes or that thigh burn like that that is really the experience that i'm looking for when i'm wanting a heavy body high and that's one of the reasons why i like the bubba kush or anything of a really dank density kush body high like raider kush from riff i found that that for some reason that strain really hits with a good body high bubba kush anything i've tried there death bubba oh any anything like that i can really really get a good heavy hearty high from and it really does hit and give me that good thigh burn and you guys have no idea how enjoyable i find that type of experience at high but six out of ten is what the berry g33 is gonna end up getting it's enjoyable you guys it's not what i personally look for and that's where that ranking's gonna come down a little bit although i definitely think you guys will enjoy it and if you guys are a newer user and you're looking for a little bit of a mental drift with a good body high go and check this out i think you guys would enjoy it um now we're going to transition into the overall and i got a 27 out of 40 which is a decent score and honestly did not too bad it was just one of those ones where the enjoyment was there but it's not overwhelming it was like it was just kind of a enjoyment right um i'll smoke this cartridge i definitely won't buy it again um if general mission is all that's available i would definitely go after the uh the the lemon ice or the tropic girl scout cookies cartridges first because honestly you guys those two for me flavor and effect um that one-to-one lemon ice cartridge hit me harder than i found any of the other ones with the exception of the tropic girl scout cookies and i uh i've got a soft spot for the girl scout cookie strain i know that so but i think you guys that's that's all we've got for today but we've got a good one coming for you guys tomorrow you come in you check it out if you guys liked like this this one definitely go click that

different types of applique we're joined by our quilt lucky star the pattern for this quilt is available at shop dot the stitch TV show calm and our show today is brought to you by our friends at in mark and Cutie fabrics and you can learn more about the links in our show notes so we're back with our speckles fabric speckles I kind of want to turn it upside down to look at all the other ones well then we can do that amazing live action yeah there you go maybe turn on the side mm-hmm fancy my favorites the blue oh hey did you see where Pantone came out with its new color classic blue classic blue is the new color of 2020 I'm gonna be seeing lots of blue stuff sadly no classic blue and our thread bundle today but we have some available with that so this is the inner solutely right nowa Gertz has the bloom in it for sure and then my quilting assortment right has some blues I think I like the Smurfs blue best this first this looks like Smurf blue okay so if it I like it only one orange so that's kind of sad but you get orange and all the other ones feel like speckle speckle speckle I know so orange is everywhere hmm anyway so so we're doing a star block smackdown okay you're gonna have to explain exactly how we're gonna do this I mean I know what a smackdown is cuz if we've done it with her before but it's always been in a guild and killed setting so I don't know how you're envisioning this panel so what we had done in our guild was put out a prompt and say okay everybody go make a pinwheel block like interpret that block make one bring it in and then we did like a bracket vote system kind of in the u.s. we have like sweet 16 is the most common black bracket it's college basketball and you start off with like there's kind of random pairings of teams and then you know you go from 16 and the winners from those eight matches get down to 8 and then from those 8 you get 4 matches and then kind of on down until there's like one winner right and so when we were talking about hey what topics we have star blocks are very popular in the quilt world and I got to thinking well what's the better star block what is that and so I put together a little bracket and we get to figure out how do we want to judge these because I know how I would judge how would you judge star blocks for quilting okay so that's so vague now you said on the last show that topic is so vague it feels like it's like because you could talk about the construction not only the technique but do you like making it easy ease of construction you know sometimes I'm attracted to blocks because they look hard yeah they are challenging so I think that's you know more attractive to me because of that and then how well once it's done you know execution of it did they make although did they cut off their points did they you know then you get into judging of like their technique it's a person who made its technique yeah but we're not looking at finished blind they're not illustrations of blocks right there's a graphic on screen of kind of eight star blocks that we're gonna be talking about and so from my perspective I think ease of construction goes into it I think versatility like do I feel like I could make this block my own could you know not just with fabric placement but could i enhance some elements can I saw about the center does it look cool you know when you start applying different fabrics in different positions right or does it get are you so focused on how this block is made ready you feel kind of limited so I was thinking versatility and welds okay so so our first pairing are kind of two similar looking blocks we have sawtooth star yes which is an eight-pointed star and an eight-pointed star now the sawtooth star is typically made with like flying geese units points and the eight-pointed star uses a V block for the points so the center is smaller in the eight points yes are because you get the tall V block yeah so the points in the center are the same in the eight pointed star in the sawtooth star you get a fatter Center yes so what I mean okay so if you were gonna make a quilt of only these two blocks which would you rather work with okay well that okay right there is number one got ha I've got hives on cuz I rarely make a quilt with the same block in it that all looks the same like that to me is boring okay let's say you're gonna add a second block I'll be determined later we would play nicer with others mm-hmm if I were using a bigger focus fabric or like I really wanted to do selective cuts and it had you know larger elements that I wanted to be a part of that the saw two star would play better but for attractiveness I like the eight point star so I would pull the eight pointed star because I like that it doesn't look even I like that it's it could be seen warez off-kilter and that to me is more attractive than the saw two star which would you choose the can't drive if the construction of the eight point star those of you blocks drive me bananas oh they drove me bananas when it's on at least half of them or I have made it in such a way that there's too much float in the background to like my point is not going all the way to the edge yeah yeah it just drives me bananas I think we'd rather do the saw to start just for easy I appreciate the symmetry of the eight point star I appreciate that but I like the mobility of the Sawtooth because you could you could do like a big focus fabric or you could be like imma throw a four patch in there I'm gonna throw a nine patch in there you can throw a four patch in the eight point star very small I like small stuff I mean you know me like I will shrink stuff down she gets on to me because I'll be like we can do six inch blocks and she's like no no we cannot I'm with six inch box with 24 pieces and I'm no I know so I would I would go for the eight point star okay is that what you're going for well how are we gonna get to the winner I mean you have passionate feelings I appreciate both I'm fine going passionate feelings and we're gonna call eight point star the winner eight points Stars winner flow I always have passionate feelings if this is not gonna go go okay so next up is the classic friendship star which is made with half square triangles for the points yeah and then a Kansas City snowflake which again is V blocks but this time kind of inverted and then you have an hourglass block in the middle and I know it's called a snowflake that's like really Kansas City that looks like a star well I know I don't care for the friendship star you know why not because to me it doesn't look like a star it looks like a SAS square that got poked at or something I've never that is and I've taught a class it's in our postcard class and I did it because it's easy to do and it's great for beginners and I've taught this block before but oh it if you're asking me for my heart no I know I just a boring blog not I'm not excited about the friendships are ever I appreciate for its simplicity but I am also fan of the Kansas City snowflake all right nuclear winter there Kansas City snowflake it is alright okay next up it's the complicated bracket we got a lone star yeah we got a feathered star oh I don't know why you put those two up against each other because they're both complicated oh man okay so um you go first I went first last time you tell me I like the real estate of the feathered star but I have to take it in moderation because that's a lot of really tiny points to make all those little feathery bits it is that's why that's an advanced piecing class right there it is it's a precision piecing class if you want a precision piecing class take one that they're teaching how to do the feathered star that said like I like Lone Star quilts I've made them before for construction I've been more successful at feathered star I like that as a look I like that you can get that real estate in the center and still have something attractive and also adds of a fussy bit so for me the feather it stars the winner yeah I've made several lone star quilt she got one going right now I've got one on the wall right now and I have made feathered star blah blah on there none I like the feathers are block however however it's not versatile the Lone Star is far more versatile and the color placement the choice the quilting in it I have more vision of what I could do for the lung star it can take on a variety of different feels like it can go from a very traditional look to very modern look I think it has more powerful color stuff and the Feathersword doesn't the feather star to me reads very traditional it's a beautiful block I like all the little fussy pieces in it it looks very traditional to me so you don't think you could make a modern feathered star I think you could but I have such I really enjoy and you know I've made what five lone stars are broken lone stars or variation of those and the one I'm working on now it will be a gift it probably will already be gone by the time this shows unless I keep it and we fill it for next one mm-hmm that may be it you may not get it right away no we got news oh that being said I I just and maybe I just loved the Lone Star look and so that's probably why I'm passionate about it I think you could do some stuff with the feather star I don't know it would be a challenge definitely see I've already got some creative juices flowing with the Lone Star so there's already that so I think the feather star would be a challenge to make it more modern or more nothing couldn't be done and there are people out there who would definitely do it well but I don't know it just it's very traditional every time I see a feathered star honestly it's always in 1,800 reproduction fabrics so in my brain it's very traditional blog interesting normally you like a challenge that's true I do baby all right let's go for it how can I make the feathered star modern or not 1800 reproduction I don't think it's just changing the colors though because you have such little bits of color hmm I still think it'll read very traditional where'd the Lone Star you can swirl it you can do all kinds of cool stuff with them let's skip let's go to the next one oh okay we're gonna is I think we're tied there I don't we are cuz and I've got feelings that I will defend okay so we may have like a three-way coming up so like the winner of this next brackets gonna take on both the Lone Star and the feathered star okay okay so we have a Lemoine star don't think will be of the same boat yeah well Lemoine star which is an eight-pointed star typically done using Y seams but can be done without Y scenes yes and then a six-pointed star which is basically six diamonds that come together right both of these have you know stars come together in the center which I've seen that star Bethlehem or star David I've seen where you could like split the diamonds yeah wise and you get some dimension to it yeah I've seen it called different I've done a lot of English paper piecing of six pointed stars that's the problem with to me with that one the six pointed star there is no getting away from the Y scene yeah you have to do Y seeing somewhere somewhere yeah and the Lemoine star you don't you can get away with it I know I think the Lemoine store is a we're just like I've done the six point it it looks beautiful I don't need to do it again I the only time I want it I do want to do the six pointed star because I do want to do a Seven Sisters quilt and that is seven little six pointed stars in that group and I love that quilt for some reason if I were gonna do a reproduction that's the one I want to do not the feather to star so I'm gonna vote once Lemoine star on that one too as am i we got a little wine star now we're back to the feathered lone all right so let's put a Lemoine star against a feathered or a lone star see okay only one stars like the center of the Lone Star to do this it is totally is so I think at its essence I would say the Lemoine star beads either those to bracket either of those other two fancy complicated ones wait you're gonna throw out my favorite star because the Lemoine star beated okay practice go go up on the go start at the top of the bracket again alright so winner from our first bracket eight pointed star and we're gonna have this on a graphic to write a spiky bits against the Kansas City snowflake so eight points versus four points both of them used V blocks so that is no longer a differentiator I like the eight point really because I like we knew this is gonna happen yeah we totally do this is good I think the eight points are you want that to be like the best star block ever cuz that's where we're heading with this oh well that one's not gonna win the whole thing but it'll get to this it'll get to the semi-finals will it yeah I think I got the pin I think the refs are paid so but think of it this way if you put an hourglass in the middle of the Kansas City snowflake or in the middle of the eight pointed star I'm flipping around that's what you got you got a Kansas City snowflake I know so that do the eight pointed star why because you could put an hourglass in it's more versatile than that one it's the same it's the same block it's the same block with that hourglass of the middle of it those two would look good in a quilt by the way they totally would we should do this I will accept your argument and I will put an eight-pointed star moved on to the semi-finals all right semi-finals a but it's Darwin I think it was that excited the first time oh the feather pillows are we're gonna have to make a decision all right defend the feathered star cuz I'm not there yet I think a feathered star gets beat by a Lemoine star but not by alone sir I feel like I'm making a deal like but the feather star is the Lemoine star know those Lemoine star is the Lone Star it's the center of it I know but I like the focus on that element right giving in so this was a tie and then Lemoine so for our final the Lemoine star versus a eight point star eight point you said it wasn't gonna win the whole thing you talking a little annoyed start down here you think the Lemoine star should be an eight point star yes when stars are difficult by themselves they doubt why seems they are but the eight point star is no slouch either cuz you gotta lose weird pointy bits yes but the eight pointed stars more virtual firsts atoll you can put in that hourglass you can put in a checkerboard you can put in a square in a square you can put in another star you got nowhere to go with Lemoine it's just a start I feel like an audience right oh my god boy the boys should have kept the Psalter then that's what they're yelling they gotta get rid of the friendship star for Jim stark took a dark turn it did take it to I totally didn't mean it right in the annals of the stitch lore okay okay okay before we die eight point versus limo was there a contender that I missed in here that you want to throw in for like a wild card hit us with some graphics cuz I know you did some research cuz I'll be willing to throw one of these over for something in your pile okay in a classic come-from-behind story the star of the east it's not that one the star of the east that's an eight-pointed star which is the Lemoine star yeah only with sides to it yeah it just no doesn't help nope okay wait a minute no no I've got the southern star that's uh that's way too hard it is totally masterful girls the rolling star that's a Lemoine star bt-dubs the star Bethlehem I would make that one the winner and it's the Lemoine star perfect and we won so I think we have agreed the Lemoine is a versatile Blokland rubber ground we should also agree that it is not an easy blog dude that is true still like a boy but she's right Lemoine is good thank God the feather got me whew that was close real dodgy surprise wild-card entrant all right star Bethlehem is our Bethlehem is the winner now we're gonna take a closer look at lucky star quilt which we'll be right back [Music] [Music] all right we're back and we're going to talk about applique application yes so there are many different types of application right fusible needle turn reverse like all of these different right techniques and what someone wrote in the notes was hey when should you use all those things when you want to that right thank you today's episode so from for me a lot of it comes down to my comfort with the durability of my hand stitches which is pretty low that's why I don't do really hand applique for anything other than a wall hanging I think and I admire these women who do the Baltimore album type applique there is a skill set to it yes it is incredible to look at but those quilts should be treasured and protected and not washed a million times it's not a it's not a type of application of applique that you want to be drug through the mud or you know you're not giving you're not spending 300 hours application a Baltimore elbow and quilt and giving it to a three-year-old just that they use you know so yeah I totally agree with that now that said generally I wouldn't put applique on a quilt that's gonna get a lot of wash because I have also found and probably me not using the right fusible but even my fusible sometimes doesn't hold with repeated washing and I make a lot of utility quilts well and I think that you know a lot of times babies newborns get a lot of applicants because that's what's cute they want the seam to be a placate on there so you see I want a quilt with elephants on it I want to quilt with panda bears or I want to you know my my sister was she wanted a koala bear a koala it's not bear sorry sorry Australia koala quilt and so I did an applique fused qualit now it hung on the wall though yeah you know but I made her a separate quote that was just all flannel and it was very much utilitarian and you know that's the one that was washed and used and stuff like that so I guess the answer to that is what are you gonna use it for it we say this a lot I think yeah what are you gonna use it for is it fused another thing that you can do that I think a lot of people don't realize but there's an applique technique with machine that you actually turn the edges under and do a zigzag you and I both done it it's Sharon Shawn Berry's method what does she call it and it's just applique again yeah terminated yeah her method of applique but it's where you actually you turn and starch the edge over a piece of like it's almost interfacing yeah that when it gets wet it kind of just turns into fiber it doesn't stay stiff it gives some dimension to it mm-hmm without necessarily adding like bulk and weight which is good so I think if you wanted that turned look but wanted to be used more mm-hmm her method may be the right method now she does recommend amount of filament threads right and you have to use the right one that doesn't feel like fishing line oh absolutely not that's horrible yes don't use fishing line in your sewing machines no ever nobody even stuff that's called monofilament thread just still kind of feels like it yeah so just don't um so I will caution you though because I did this this week I don't know oh but do as as we say not as right exactly so um I wanted to make this little sign it said so many days till Christmas and so I thought I would cut out the font in the fused on my I have a cutter like a digital cutter I have a digital cutter thingy and so what you want to be cautious about and this did cut it out and I could have glued this all down but you'll notice that was so fussy because the font was so small and I think what you need to pay attention to if you have a quarter inch or smaller anything font vine tiny flowers two tiny flowers that whatever you know it may not be the best use a digital cutter to cut that out one and two fused applique may be a nightmare for you it feels like it would separate very easily if you just tugged on it oh well not only that but like this is the D for days or whatever and you can see the top it's only held together by maybe two four threads and you've got to peel the now you've got glue there but you've got to peel the paper away and then when you stitch over that it feels like the needles gonna hit the middle of the fibers and just make him go oh it will it will so anytime you're doing what I would never do for applique and I didn't pay attention when this was being cut is anything anytime that it's a quarter of an inch or smaller don't do it especially with fuse but I don't know how you do that with needle turn either a quarter of an inch little tiny this is where you get out markers and you draw that in India ink will be your friend and that's what I ended up doing on this I actually used the chalkboard fabric and I chalked it in because it I could draw a line faster than I could and that was just not gonna work and y'all can see the finished element on a video link right up there right and that was not gonna work so you know I'm not saying don't try it try it but you can see I still mess around with stuff all the time yeah and fail I failed if you had used say a batik fabric that has a tighter weave than a traditional cotton would it have same results would have been a little better a little better but same results because you're dealing with such a small kind of edge now there are I just used a wonder under for my fused here I think if you would have done steam a seam - it would have finished sealed the edge and it could have been better a heat and a bond could have been better because it's got a different glue and that glues stronger I'd have to play with it yeah but I just if I found it if you're dealing with stuff too small you're just gonna get those weird frayed edges I mean you're talking about and not just not just because a machine cut this I mean if you're trying to cut something that small - yeah even by hand with very sharp scissors right that's just don't grab him out of the craft drawer no that's not a thing that the ones that the kids use yeah like the dull points my adult craft you're very different yeah exactly so do you find I mean are there certain types of application that you steer clear of or so when I'm using applique for just an accent on what is mostly a pieced quilt like oh I'm gonna put a monogram as you should every time I will turn the edges under and stitch it down right because to me it's like if it's an you know 95% pieced background I'm just like putting an accent on there I will turn the edges under I won't do fusible sometimes it's easier yeah and and especially if it's if it's like a very large letter which is typically it looks like a you know 12 inches highs it's not like a little teeny one yeah and it's there's a lot more room to kind of get in get the corners right and it's not quite as fussy right but typically I'm not doing a lot of applique as much as you do all right and I probably will get into that more cuz yeah I've been sitting looking at my living room like I've had this weird tapestry there and I could probably just make a quilt that would go there and it would be cool if that looked like X and that design in my head is applique yeah I think yeah it was dangerous I was washing dishes rarely do I do that I was standing at the sink washing dishes and I was like oh look there's open wall space that should be filled so it's bad when you look around your house go there wait there's nothing right there on that wall that we could add something so I've been doing a lot of smaller projects lately cuz I wanted to fill wall space like I've got a hallway coming down to the basement it's gonna have a lot of quills in it in my brain there's a lot being done in my brain they haven't all come out like in real life yet but they're in my brain so that's what I know stay away from a little small stuff who are you gonna give it to you I think that's really handy flick a is for but early posters heirloom pieces and the people who enjoy doing it love it they find it relaxing they find it you know and for them it's a bucket quilt you know it's one of those I want to do a Baltimore Alba mesh quilt and I'm gonna hand applique or you know I've seen these that where they do all the I've seen them do baby quilts with the arc and all the animals coming out of it you know that's great do it enjoy it just who you gonna give it to what's its purpose and make sure they understand each eyes is it gonna be washed yeah that's the key kind of thing you know I'm not saying that there's quilts out there with dirt in it from 200 years ago but there is do you change how you quilt if you've used a different applique method like fusible versus like a turned edge do you quilt that differently no I don't and is that because you're just quilting the background space and leaving the applique done quilted uh no I do quilt applique that would be that being said I'm trying to think if I've done I've only done a few turned edge pieces and I and I don't think I've quilted them so I can't answer that truthfully I guess I can answer it in that I haven't done it but I don't see me hand applic hand applique usually they've gone in and added any of thee if it's something like it's a big piece they've gone ahead and added embroidery they've gone in and added the lines and nine times out of ten those things are hand quilted yeah you know if you're spending that much time you're probably gonna hand quilt it anyway not all of them and they don't have to be but I've not done it so I don't know I don't think I would but it would depend on what they've already done don't you think well I think on the size of the shapes being used to so when I think of when I've done applique on a pieced quilt and I have a design it's usually by the fabric and the I'm like quilting kind of to the piece in that monogram I'm leaving the application prior on quilted so it'll pop right yeah yeah and when I think of you know I had done a Baltimore album quilt but I did it as fusible it was a Halloween Baltimore album oh these three designs yeah and I did go and for the most part I just outlined to write on the outside of those shapes after they were yeah now I've done a McKenna Ryan pattern which also done is fusible and that again was gone and quilted with monofilament and it's in for that one I was like went rogue I didn't stitch down the applique before I quilted it I used the quilting as the stitching forage and so it was I had to cold every piece or it might you know peel off that would not be good no and I know theoretically like fusible should not do that because you know it should fuse but apparently I can I'm not always mean well I'm sure were friendly with the instruction it just depends on the fusible I'm gonna manufacture and all this stuff yeah does so do what you want you can use the different application methods for lots of different uses but just be aware of the consequences if you wash it a hundred times if you watch anything a hundred times already honest yeah yeah so there you go what are you did you have passionate feelings about our star block smackdown you want to defend a choice yes yes I do please leave a

this week we're gonna be diving into the tangy kush from good supply i've had this one set aside for quite a while i thought it was finally time to actually dig into it and try it out i'm looking forward to it i hope you guys are as well but for the time being we're gonna go ahead and slide on into the intro before we get into this cartridge you guys i'll see you on the other side when we're gonna get into the info then we're gonna start smoking our way through it cheers i'll see on the other side [Music] hey guys and welcome back so as i said in the intro we are going to be diving into the tangy kush 510 vape cartridge from good supply so these guys came out with a thc total on this cartridge of 79.4 percent we've got a cbd total of 0.7 percent and a package date of july 20th 2020 and a price of 35.99 so all in all this cartridge has got a lot to offer for that price point the 35.99 is great to see especially when we're getting into these half grammers because that's that's a more reasonable entry point for these cartridges and they definitely seem to be the good supply the hexo the retican anything at that price point definitely seems to be moving a lot of so will be very interesting to see how this one does because i haven't tried it yet so on the ontario cannabis store website which is the only place i was able to find the full details in one place we're going to rattle off the information for this cartridge before we dive into it you guys so get down with the citrus tangy kush has arrived in potent distillate form and is a hundred percent plant-based you'll know what they mean when they say tangerine good vapes from good supply so the licensed producer is a fria or good supply it's a very strong potency the thc range is going to be the 77 to 83 percent the cbd is going to range right around that zero percent it is sativa dominant it's a co2 extraction process and your top terpenes are going to be alpha penine beta meristenine beta pinene and linolol so i'm quite curious to see how this is going to taste and see if we get that really citrusy orange tangerine flavor that the tangy kush name and the description has for us you guys but we're going to go ahead and get our urban scale intro in here before we uh dive in with the uber battery first and then we go into our g pen before we finish it through the glass and then we'll talk about the high and give it an overall out of 40 you guys so let's break this seal and get into this cartridge and see how good supply did with this tangy cushy guys i'll see on the other side of the urban scale because we've got that open [Music] welcome back you guys so let's go ahead and get this cartridge out and let's take our first looks at it so overall i do really like the good supply cartridges one thing is the thc sticker comes off really easy and as well they do have a very nice basic look to them as well as well so you used to go to the other side well-branded so you've got the good buds wrap right there and then you've got the tangy kush in the green so it keeps you well well informed on what you're exactly smoking on so let's get that thc sticker up on there and uh we're gonna go ahead and start out with the uber battery the way we do our battery tests is we run through all three of the temperatures or voltages that are available on these batteries so for the vuber we go green blue red for the g pen we go blue green red and then after that we do the exact same thing but we run it through our rigs so the mad hatter and the vuber battery go together our 420 and our g pen battery go together and we do all of that using our hemper adapter right here so now that you guys kind of know what to expect while we're diving into this we're gonna just go ahead and dive into this i'm gonna take my first haul with the good supply tang kush cartridge to see how the initial flavor and effects are going to be before we crank it up and we start rattling this review off for you guys so enough talking we're almost five minutes into this let's go ahead and try this cartridge and see how it does choose you guys and i'll see you on the other side [Music] okay so hint of an orange very much a hint of an orange now there's kind of a floral licorice combo on the afterwards like it's it's almost more of like an uh and a set like that kind of not a raw black licorice not that harsh licorice flavor that you can sometimes sometimes find this definitely doesn't have that it's that really watery orange a tangeriney orange flavor with a little bit of that licorice undertone which is interesting you guys not something i expected but it's interesting so we're gonna go ahead and take our second haul with the second temp and see how it does through there and i'm curious to see if it goes more the citrus route or more of this kind of gummied candied wine gum almost kind of experience you guys so it sticks with that light tan it's it's very much more of that wine gum style experience you guys where while you're chewing on the candy you're getting that sweet kind of fruity flavor but at the same time there's just there's something there that is taking your attention off of it and it's making you look for another type of flavor which personally i don't mind like i i don't mind a thinking a thinking man's kind of smoke where you have to really figure out what you're tasting i don't mind that at all when it comes to the cartridges i wish it was a little bit more intense for the overall flavor like i wish both flavors were just more more oomph there a little bit more carry to it but all in all i'm not that disappointed and i'm still enjoying this cart so far you guys now we're going to crank it up to the highest temp we've got it set on the red setting let's go ahead and take our first hauls at this level before we move on into the g pen and try it there you guys but for now the tangy kush isn't doing bad it's enjoyable but it's not overwhelming okay so that had the strongest overall flavor like as i was saying this needs to just increase get a little bit more um potent just a little bit stronger flavor that's what happened when we bumped up to that highest temp so i'm curious if it's an airflow thing or a temperature based issue for the flavor because that one i see i don't know why but i always haul harder and faster through the higher temperatures where the lower ones i like to sip and kind of paste on where with this uh this cartridge moving over to the g pen we're gonna have larger ports so it's naturally gonna have more airflow so i'm curious if that's gonna allow us to get a sweeter more rich flavor because the comparison of the two batteries is really part of the reason why i do the reviews the way i do it just because i want to really see where the cart does best and i want to show you guys where the cart does best so through the uber battery i'm gonna give it a six because i wouldn't say it was enjoyable it didn't have enough overwhelming and uplifting and really powerful flavors or experience to get me go oh [ __ ] yeah that's an eight that's like it's really really up uplifting enjoyable exciting seven or eight i can't i just it's not quite there five or six it's got kind of that plus it's got that little umph to it that's enjoyable but nothing overwhelming or nothing that really is um or nothing that really makes me go [Music] over the moon with excitement it's just kind of it's there now moving into the g pen we've got the lowest temp set up let's see how it does through here before we go back into the vooper battery and run it through the glass and then we go through and do it with the g pen all over again you guys we still have lots of smoking left but first and foremost let's get through this cheeto okay so tangerine flavor a little bit on the lighter side in this one we definitely get more of that anise that licorice more floral kind of push it's got more of that wine sign to the wine gums which personally i'm enjoying i would rather a strong tangerine flavor and i would really prefer that kind of sweet juicy experience but this is nice it's just not top of the list nice it's enjoyable but forgetful that that's really the experience of having with this cartridge so far you guys now we're gonna move up to the second temperature see how it does through there and then wrap it up with the highest attempt so let's see what mid-range does for us [Music] okay so i got surprisingly more orange on that one but it didn't change the overall flavoring that i was getting like the balance leaned a little bit more to the orange side but it didn't hold that orange tangerine that citrus flavor that i'm getting does not hold it hits and it passes and then we get that floral that licorice that wine version of the wine gum flavor you guys that is enjoyable i will say that i am enjoying it quite a bit now i would prefer the orange and the citrus flavor if i'm being 100 honestly guys and why not when we're doing these reviews be 100 honest so that's what i'm looking for is just more orange flavor for me to enjoy but for the time being you guys we're going to go ahead and finish up our just cartridge reviews before we dive into the glass and then we talk about the high so see how it does in the highest temperature you guys cheers okay so let's quickly switch that temperature back on over to the lowest so we do not forget to do that when we uh take our ribs through the rigs but the g pen i'm not i'm honestly i'm gonna give it a 6 out of 10 as well it was a smoother draw smoother experience overall i will give it that now saying that it didn't have as much of that citrus flavor and citrus push that the uber battery did the uber had the better flavor the g-pad had the better smoking experience but neither of them were over the moon exciting really overly enjoyable it was very much i'm smoking this to get high not necessarily to enjoy the flavor when i'm comparing it and that this is the biggest thing you guys when i'm saying anything like this this is in comparison to the best cartridge i've smoked so far or the better cartridges i've smoked so far a lot of the anytime i'm doing that i uh well i'm using it's always in comparison to the stuff that i've really enjoyed because that i'll smoke for flavor like the orange cookies there's there's certain strains and certain cartridges that i will smoke purely for flavor because that enjoyment is the enjoyment i absolutely love the flavor is what sells me that strain now there are another category of strains and vapes and concentrates that are they [ __ ] me up they just get me high and that's a totally separate purpose for i'm enjoying the flavor i'm enjoying the flavor is i'm sitting at home i don't have anything planned i'm gonna get baked out in my mind so i'm just gonna smoke what i like to smoke this gets behind okay these strains have a specific purpose they help me this way i don't necessarily enjoy the flavor as much but i need this effect or i need this type of high or i need to i'm going to do this so i need like it's that give to take kind of companionship and this cartridge i'm finding is leaning more to that enjoyment than the actual enjoying the taste of the cartridge but until we run them through these rigs you never know because we could run it through some water and it could just blow me away and then at that point it'll become one of those pre-loaded bong kind of cartridges like i've got a purpose for everything i smoke i find a way to enjoy it the best that i can so enough talking you guys i i i get on these little rambles and then you guys get to enjoy a couple of minutes of me just going off but enough enough of that it's time to get back into the review and why you guys are here and that's going to be taking this tang and kush cartridge for some more rips let's start it out with our vuber battery and the mad hatter glass rig the way we do this is we start with the lowest temperature we go to the second highest and then after that we preheat and we grip at the highest temperature before we move on over and do it again with the g pen and the other glass rig and then we'll give you a total out of the six rips for out of the glass you guys but for the time being let's get into it cheers okay first strip wasn't bad it's definitely going to be a licorice and out of scent kind of exp and a set kind of experience through this you guys so let's get through those first couple hauls done and they're not bad they're not bad at all they've got a decent flavor very much that ascent experience but we're preheating the cartridge right now we're going to take a rip on the highest 10. see how it does here choose you guys okay guys so uber battery through the glass licorice honestly that is the most accurate and most realistic um flavor that i can give you for what i got through there there was the really light kind of citric like that acidic burn that you get from oranges tangerines that that kind of sweet acid that you get there that citric experience i was getting that 100 i was getting that in there but that was just kind of the primary burn at the back of my throat and then it would go straight into this licorice and a set kind of experience that all in all you guys isn't that bad i actually enjoyed it quite a bit but but we um definitely definitely could have a better experience and a better flavor if we were to get more of that tangy that orange citrusy kind of experience you guys but all in all cartridge did quite well and a lot better than i was expecting but for the time being we're going to go ahead and take our ribs with the g pen through our 420 rig guys and see how it does in here because i'm quite curious to see if our g pen is going to be the savior and really give us this uh tangerine tangy kush or if we're going to keep playing in the licorice fields but for the time being let's go ahead and dive into this i'll see you guys when we're working our way through it cheers second rip y'all cheers [Music] last trip preheat let's see guys cheers [Music] okay guys so the glass is gonna end up getting a 5 out of 10. honestly oh little stutter on that one but honestly the cartridge i think this cartridge again supports kind of that theory that i'm having where it just if you don't give it the time to cool down and really bring in the new oil and really start to recover from each haul you're you're gonna lose terps and you're gonna lose flavor because after that first first hit i didn't get anywhere near the type of orange flavor and i just transitioned into more and more and more licorice and asset kind of an experience which personally i don't mind but if that's what you're pushing for the flavor and that's what i'm expecting getting into it i'll enjoy it a lot more than if you go well it's kind of a tangerine flavor my excitement and my and especially when it comes to sativas i don't like the licorice flavor for stevias i really don't sativas i want citrus i want fruity i want sugary sweet really sweet flavors or give me my cushes like that kind of swamp ass kush if it's got that benefit i love that kush flavor so i'm willing to smoke that day or night now the citrus flavors i didn't really smoke those day or night but i know those typically lean more towards the sativa side so i love starting my day off with a nice big bowl of orange juice mimosa like citrus it's my thing but this one wasn't quite when uh when we switched over to the g pen it honestly got worse for that licorice flavor got more intense it got definitely a lot more um it's a best word for it the best way to explain it is the balance changed quite heavily from having a hint of the orange to just not really be in there and it was actually quite disappointing once it got to that level you guys and i i i just wish i really do wish that there was more of a citrus tangerine push through this now moving on to the high the high is going to be where it does its best with the seven out of ten it's right on that enjoyable portion it's not really a [ __ ] you up kind of a vape it is definitely one of those you're getting stuff done but you just need that relief you need to have that like for me it just gives me that ease and the ability to take the half a second think about what's going on and then react like for any of the anxiety stress anything along there there's just that that reliefs that you're not wound up you're not a a spring just press ready to [ __ ] break or just snap out and just explode right it's just it gives you that very much ease and relaxing and gives you a little bit of an uplifting and encouraging effect but not not enough for me to really notice it um there is a touch of the mental drift but it's relatively easy to work through and it passes in five or ten minutes so it's more of just that that rush that really high rush high you get a little bit of that mental drift and then it passes relatively quickly but all in all you guys this vape card was enjoyable it just didn't have the flavors that i really want with my vapes being more my desserts of smoking i'm a lot harder when it comes to when you say you're going to be tasting like orange i'm going to expect you to taste a little bit more like gourds than uh than i do with my bud but overall you guys not bad definitely would recommend if you like more of that licorice orange combo that that kind of tiger ice cream almost experience which personally not minding just not my favor especially today but overall out of 24 out of 40 pretty good score it did not too bad honestly it didn't do too bad you guys it's just it's one of those ones where it's 36 bucks before tax it gets the job done it's decent and the thc range on it is actually quite nice and if you don't mind the flavors or if you're not that worried about the flavors it's definitely a cartridge worth picking up because you definitely get your value in the high um but we're gonna we're gonna wrap this one up you guys that that's gonna be it for today and the tangy kush bait from good supply didn't do too bad with a six out of ten out of the boober the six out of ten out of the g pen five out of ten on the glass a seven for the high for the total of 24 out of 40. can't complain too much we got baked this morning and you guys get to enjoy it as well but for the time being we're gonna wrap this one up my end card will slide in here you guys all you have to do will be hover over my logo in the

more content", "PxL8RgmvK3I": "hey what's up guys what did do is you boy mr. bling see I'm coming back at you with another video I think I just cringed after I said that but uh anyway today I wanted to just talk about some carts uh in specific fake carts because like I've been watching a lot of other people's videos on like your views of carts and [ __ ] and anytime they review something that's like a dank vape or a dab wood or like a cereal cart all I see in the comments are over you smoking home to fake cards oh you've got no food carts oh that car doesn't have the holo graphics on it so I think that fake um I would like to just say shut the [ __ ] up cuz like I'm pretty sure everyone who smokes carts knows that all of these aren't real carts because I mean it's pretty obvious if you smoke them yourself you can get different packaging which are like fake our carts from a fake cart in general but just starting off this video all of these carts are fake these two are real though I'm just gonna show you the packaging on these real quick so first off they have the California label and that's something only some of these fake car companies can write or copy onto their packaging but uh anyway you have a sticker that clearly labels your total THC and CBD content your strain how many milligrams you're getting and what type of weed it is you have this sticker label on the top that seals the box you have this sticker label on the back that lists your THC and CBD again and a government warning all of this information is on this legit kingpin packaging even the way the packaging it comes in obviously I mean like these are long since weak but uh you get a nice little kingpin cart it looks very nice it's all high quality you can open it in case you want to take the wax out it's a legit kingpin cart it even has the like the label a you can't scratch off I just hit my camera mess up my then I think it was a shame all right so you have all of these other companies that are making black-market cards all of these are black-market cards the thing is it's just some companies do it better than others and I don't know why some companies decide to lie about what they're putting in the curt's like trap house they put a rough percentage of your THC content they put all natural high percent organic no PG VG or PE d and they even copy the California sticker the thing is trap house is an alleged company and so these aren't real cards they're fake cards but they're high-quality fake cards if I would say so myself I just finished their Venice og one and like the waxen this was just as good if not better than the wax and these kingpin cards don't hate to kingpin though these were nice um but yeah so like just because it's a car is fake doesn't mean that it's not gonna work the thing is these are full of harmful chemicals not full of them but like Oh some more but these are pure wax they're not gonna harm you these though even though they say they don't have PG or VG they do they're mixed with that it's real wax but it's mixed to dilute it in therefore you get more use out of it the way you can tell if it's a higher quality fake wax is if it moves slowly and if it's like a deep golden color or like yeah a deep golden brown um I think out of all of these carts the worst one I've had was this chronomaly skittles cart obviously the packaging is fake I never seen Khurana play anywhere else it doesn't even have like the fake California label on it oh yeah it does but it's like an even weirder one they always say lab tested on percent organic but they're not like it's very obvious when you're hitting these cards that they are mixed with something some of them here really harsh dank babes as you can see his had to change sorry about that I had to fix my camera back because I'm sort of hit it while I was trying to talk about these dang babes packaging um what I was trying to say was dank babes has had to change their packaging three times since January because other people are now taking their packaging and putting fake tarts inside of already fake cart packages which is such an insane thought to me but it's kind of good that dank vapes likes to like at least change up the way that they're selling theirs think their stuff so that people are at least getting somewhat higher quality wax under thinning that I like another thing that I like about dang vapes is that you can't open these see cell atomizers that they use for their wax they're stuck closed and that's a good thing because the fact that all of these companies mix actual THC like weed wax with VG and PG it makes it harmful for you if you take it out of the cart when you're smoking it in the car it'll make you coffee cuz it's kind of harsh it might taste really good but it's still not that great for you imagine that but worse if you take and open these car packages and then you try to actually dab the wax from them Auto break some of these companies make it so that you can unscrew the top of their carts you can refill them obviously but then you can also take the wax out and that's where you can run into problems once you burn the wax that's mixed with VG and PG on a rig it can be super harmful for you because we're not supposed to be combusting those chemicals they're used in actual vape juice that you would mix with nicotine for people to stop smoking they're not meant to be used for THC cartridges obviously you can use them and people are but I feel like people should just put out the information that yes these are fake yes they do work but you have to at least also be careful with them and know what you're getting yourself into before you start trying to like just smoke cards out of the blue and thinking that all of these these are legit I'm pretty sure even exotic like their wax is around the same quality as dank vapes I'm not sure if they're super legit but I know that their wax is not like an amazing quality wax it's decent but it's not great these trap house cards they are pretty good I would suggest them just as highly as I would suggest at King pen but only with the information that these are mixed with VG and that they can harm you and I think like my basic opinion is that these cards while they are fake are just as good as legit carts as long as you know hey I'm sort of damaging my body by using these and you just continue with the information in mind if you can get legit carts I would highly suggest doing that because while they may not like get you as high as these like immediately you might take me need to take a few more hits but these also last longer they're more healthy for you and I mean the smoke is super smooth so it doesn't feel like I was harming myself at all when I was using these cards these carts are probably cheaper and more available to you so if that's your like only choice try some of them out but like try to figure out what brands you prefer over the ones that are like sort of harmful um I feel like this video ended up being a bit of a ramble I'm sorry about that but I also hope that if you did watch you enjoyed and um yeah I'll just catch you all next time see you", "NJUtFR5jw5E": "hi welcome back to cannabis with kim i just wanted to touch base i know this is uh going to be one of my maybe my last videos for a little bit until you know after my surgery and i get things figured out so we'll see like i said going in this week for um knee replacement surgery so i had to make a little visit to the dispensary picked up some goods so i wanted to show you some new packaging that's out i thought was kind of interesting um let me just start with the remedy the rest rso so obviously i picked up some indica because of course the first thing they want to do is put me back on opiates um for my knee and really trying to avoid um that downward spiral and so i just decided to kind of pump up on all of my goods so i'm gonna make out some of my little capsules and i just thought this is kind of cool i mean you know we're paying for it but look you gotta double push the back and so of course you can see we've got handpicked cannabis and here's our info on the cannabinoids now this is only a half of a gram so in other words 0.5 grams or 500 milligrams and you can see that in this entire syringe we have 342 milligrams of thc um not really cbd cbda thca so the other cannabinoids are really not playing the forward so i was really just looking for pain relief and going to sleep so i just thought oh my look at our special little new box to hold i mean come on that's a lot of money spent on just a half a gram so remember this is already activated so rso is ready to go and uh let me see if i can tap it out nope i can't but you know it's just a syringe and we have it marked um per you know uh milligram so um or per 100 milligrams i should say you know and so this normally we see a full gram so there'd be twice as much in here but you know this is what they had it was um decent price in comparison to some of the other ones especially because of like i said the amount of cannabinoids so this one cost me with my discount you know 29 and change so it's around 30 bucks right so this is 30 bucks for over 300 milligrams and see that's a good price that's a little bit more it's about 110 milligrams per 10 dollars and that's right a hundred milligrams should only be ten dollars same with one gram in a dispensary of weed should be ten dollars so just putting that out there again all right now this i wanted to show you the um i know i've been doing a lot of the disposable cartridges okay so this is cresco i know you all have a love relationship with crosco i am a big fan of certain strains and this is one of them bio jesus is one of my favorite strains um for pain and this has got our little stats on it and again this was this is the uh sticker that closes it so this one is at 82.78 percent there we go seven eight five percent no thca no cbd no cbda again bio jesus and this is an indica so this one is you know 99 and that's really what we're looking for so again this guy's a double push we're grown in illinois and then um so whoo she got away from me just slide her open and then we have what a lovely little terpene well it talks about the fact that it's got liquid live resin so this is one full gram all right and again i got this for a hundred and really again it should only be a hundred for a full gram because it's ten dollars per 100 milligrams so that's the proper price that's what you should be paying but we're paying way more than that in illinois but anyway what do i love about this well it explains to you about the liquid live resin which is nice so cresco liquid live resin is a high terpene now remember terpenes so this is why i wanted to show you this is because um terpenes are valuable medicinal properties to cannabis that if you are smoking your cannabis you are disintegrating i mean immediately your the combustion rate of a flame will eliminate your terpenes immediately and you will not actually get the benefits of them so that's why uh vaping and um infusion are great methods of getting your terpenes all right so remember like terpenes are in a lot of different things so remember like mercine is in mangoes and a lot of people are like oh can you get higher if you do mangoes well yeah the the mercene in the in the in the um", "SPKdyldLvdw": "hey y'all trevor here with red leaf and today i'm going to be diving into the bubba kush one gram cartridge from legend i'm really excited to see how this is going to do honestly the bubba kush strain has been my favorite for quite a while anything based off of this lineage absolutely has me enjoying the high it has a nice and intense high for me as well d bubba personally favorite lineage strain based off of this but um with that you guys should know i'm quite excited for this cartridge so let's get this intro in here let's dive into this one gram cartridge from legend and see how their bubba kush comes through on the concentrated side of the game you guys cheers and i'll see you over there [Music] hey y'all and welcome back like i said in the intro we're going to be diving into the one gram push cartridge from legend i'm really excited to dive into this cartridge and try it out i'm a huge fan of the bubba kush strain and once i saw this one gram option with a reasonable price point on it i just had to get it for myself to actually dive in and try out now with that being said let's quickly cover what we will be going over over the next 20 to 25 minutes with you guys in this cartridge review so to start things off we go ahead and we cover the information that comes on this baggie or the boxer however the cartridge is contained that gives us the exact concentrate the package date everything that we can get off of this little bag after that we move over onto a website today i'm going to be using the leafly website i was unable to find the legend.ca website and any of the other online sites i was able to have pull up wasn't referring to this cart specifically and this is the website that i've had with the best overall information what looks like to be the information that's provided by legend in itself so the leafly website will be the one that we dive into today for that information and then once we are done with that we have two batteries here that we are going to be running through first we'll take our rips through the vuber battery we start at the lowest temperature here which is going to be our green we then work our way up to the blue and finish off with the red giving it a score out of 10 at the end of this now we go ahead and we do the exact same thing through the g pen except we start off with blue we move to green and finish off with red we give this a score out of 10 as well the different temperatures that we experience not only between the two batteries but each time we adjust the settings is going to provide a little bit of a different flavor a little bit of a different experience and overall just something unique that this cartridge has to provide and sometimes there's big changes sometimes there's no changes it really does depend on the strain and the cartridge since we scored these individually based off of the batteries themselves when we move on over into the glass rigs we score them as a unit so after the total of a dozen rips we take off this cartridge we have three scores we have the one for the uber battery we have the one for the g pen and then we have our score out of 10 for the six rips that we run through our little glass rigs here we go through the vuber first and then our g pen all three temperatures and we preheat that last rib because it's the only time only thing we haven't done already and it's a one time i find that the it actually does play a factor in the flavor and not necessarily just the harshness and the intensity to the throat so that is all we have for the smoking side of this this review before we wrap it up and give you guys the overall we do have to stop and talk about the high we give it a score out of 10 after we do that and that will add up to our total out of 40. you're looking for a uh what was it that we're looking for on this one a 32 out of 40 or higher for it to get that beautiful herbage you need the eights consistently across the board but for the time being let's go ahead dive into this cartridge you guys can get this review on the way so if you don't know by now we're gonna be smoking the one gram bubba kush cartridge from legend this sucker came in with a thc total of eighty percent a cbd total of zero point zero six percent and it was packaged on the 18th of november this is going to be an indica dominant cartridge and the price point is down in the corner i forgot to save the receipt so i'm gonna have to go and ask when we uh head back in before i get this video uploaded i'll add it in the editing portion of it now moving over to the leafly website let's quickly get this information off because i am very excited to try this cartridge out so the information they have for the bubba cooks cartridge is as follows bubba kush is a classic heavy indica with wide popularity this earthy coffee fuel filled profile also boosts sweet and chocolate notes the top five terpenes include terpinoline maricinine beta carefully guaialol and lemonade high purity extract natural terpenes and there are no additives or fillers to these cartridges the thc range is going to be that of 80 milligrams per gram the cbd range is going to be that of less than 60 milligrams per gram the size is going to be a one gram cartridge the type is indica dominant the aroma is earthy sweet and fully and the prominent terpenes are terpenoline meristem and carefully this is going to be a legend based product you guys now with all that information rattled off you guys are up to date i'm up to date let's get this package open let's get into this uh into this arabic scale and see how this cartridge judge does i will see you guys on the other side when we have it screwed in to our uber battery and we got this rocket guys cheers welcome back you guys so as i said we're coming back when this cartridge is screwed into our uber battery well she screwed in it's looking pretty good we have that all black top and the silver to match up with the uber and honestly you guys i'm loving the way these cartridges are matching up especially the one grammars with our vuber it's just looking classy with uh the silver and silver pairing up versus that silver and gold look i had originally with that fireside battery but with that being said we do have the set on the lowest temp not getting a strong aroma from this cartridge like some do have that cushman's that i got from back 40 that we smoked last week very potent aroma when you cracked open the container you could smell what you're going to taste this one not quite the same experience now that being said we're going to get to haul off of it and see if the flavor's there i'm hoping for a true bubba kush experience because then this one gram card is easily going to become a favorite of mine if that's what we have to dive into you guys but we can uh only talk about it so much before we start smoking it and it's about that time so cheers you guys and let's get these first couple of ribs in okay i would honestly not say baba kush experience it is very very sweet tasting there isn't so much of that kind of earthy swampy taste that i'm a big fan of with that bubba kush strain the um kind of richness of that chocolate flavor is a big big like a real favorite of mine and right now all i'm really getting with that lower lower temperature is that lemony that really strong kind of citrus gassy experience if it sticks with that throat i am going to be happy i'm going to enjoy it but that's not why i got this cartridge i'd want my lemon i'd want my citrus cartridges my hazy style cartridges to lean that way the bubble cush cartridge not quite that much but let's uh bump the temperature up to the blue the mid-range let's see if we get a little bit more of that earthy rich flavor i'm gonna really haul off at this time and see if that intensity might change it but i don't know that that first hall is kind of throwing me off a little bit you guys so let's take the second one see what we have to compare to cheers okay so it does a hit with a little bit more intensity you do as i try and fight fight my way through it you get that pepper ring in the back your throat that i'm finding kind of builds up and is working up into my sinuses i am a little bit stuffed up just my nose is right now a little bit stuffed up um and when that happens especially the higher higher beta-carotene strains i find end up just giving that a little bit more of a nose burn sensation kind of um almost like when you're eating hot wings or anything like that where it's got just that activation where your sinuses and your nose almost wants to start running when i have that clogged up that beta carefully and that's a kind of experience i have as well and i'm i'm feeling that i can feel that kind of almost heat and clearing of my sinuses and it's it's crazy that i actually notice that big of a difference like it's a very clearing like i can breathe fully through my nose now and it it's something that peppery strains have a huge benefit for me i don't know why but if i'm stuffed up if i'm feeling anything like that i get a little bit of a nose run but i get very clear ability to breathe which is a huge benefit and it's crazy that that's what i'm experiencing with this but it sticks with that lemon type of flavor it's got very much kind of a white pepper cross it's got that lemon hand but that white raw pepper burn at the back your throat so i don't know what to experience from this from this cartridge it might just be the uber battery with the smaller ports the temperatures that's or the voltage that's being pumped out to the cartridge might not be exactly optimal for that that really cushy earthy flavor and really leaving us with more of that lemony citrus gassy type of experience and the peppers just coming for the for um the ride because it's a primal terpene and it's one of those ones that really makes itself present no matter how minimal or majority of the percentage of the terpenes present is there i always tend to find that pepper or woody flavor makes a presence now i've gabbed on long enough between the the second and the third rip let's see if we can invite that more earthy swampy flavor to come play at the higher temperature if not let's see if the g pen is going to do it for us because as much as i like the gassy hint you guys it's not what the bubba kush strain is meant for me i like that more earthy swampy taste that more uh like dragging your face in this in the dirt that's that's that kush taste that i like but let's go ahead try it out the highest temp before we move over to the g pen and see what that can do cheers okay guys so with that uber i am going to give it a 7 out of 10. and that second stage ramble that we got i don't need to go on it about it again because it's very much that same experience you guys we got that lemon we got the pepper burn in the back nothing really else to show for it um honestly i did enjoy the experience i did enjoy the overall flavor it's just not exactly what i'm looking for seven out of seven out of ten is what i'm going to give it and if this was a haze cartridge or a citrus cartridge or anything along those lines a gas cartridge a ds like the strain diesel cartridge if it was that it would be getting eights or nines but the fact that this is a bubba kush cartridge and it tastes gassy not cushy personally i can't score it higher i cannot score it because it's not what i'm looking for and that's a big disappointment on my side great cartridge great flavor not what i'm looking for though when i'm getting this specific strain and there you'll find that some of these scores are going to come along like that where it's more i know what i'm looking for and this ain't it for the bubba kush flavor this ain't it so let's see if the g pen gives us that opportunity or lets us work through to see if maybe the rigs will but i at this point i don't know what to expect you guys i'm thinking more just that kind of citrus gassy flavor but let's dive in and find out cheers okay there that g pen and it might be the airflow might be the might be just the voltage that it's putting out there's a lot of differences between the jeep head and the uber that would make subtle experiences alter almost and that's what i'm finding that gassy flavor is definitely the most predominant flavor i'm ex i'm experiencing through here but that pepper flavor it's got a little bit of a lead into it now before you get that ring around your throat it's got that almost rich cocoa kind of an experience where it almost takes that and it moves into kind of like that cinnamon-style burn almost into the pepper that way where it goes really really savory and transitions over into that kind of a peppered spice and it gives you that kind of hint of that earthy the the way that like cocoa powder has that rich almost earthy experience but it's a little bit too rich for that a little bit too sweet for it it's right on that verge so the g pen could could come in as a saving grace for that kind of cushy experience but we're not going to find out without taking the other two rips you guys so let's go ahead take our second one see what we have to play with there before finishing off at the highest temp and moving back over to the uber battery and into our rigs so uh let's go ahead and take that haul you guys cheers hey guys so second rip from the g pen very similar in the sense of the uber of that pepper ring making a major premise presence it definitely leaves you with that more throat burn experience that kind of ring around your uh honestly that ring around your throat that just leaves you sitting there wanting a glass of water and it's just that decent little burn now that being said we definitely got a little bit of a richer more earth experience before that pepper ring took over and once that pepper ring took over we lost all of that kind of earthy cushy flavor and that's a disappointment for me this this cartridge is working its way over there but it's not quite producing the intensity that i'm that i'm looking for i'm really hoping that once we get it through the glass it starts kicking in there but for the time being there's nothing really selling me on uh this cart to being anything different than that haze cart from bingo because that's really what i'm experiencing here you guys is just that kind of citrusy gassy experience with a little bit of a different touch to it and the haze was like that and this is just going a little bit of a different way to that approach but we got our last strip on the g pen before we score this up and uh get the halfway point this review and our hauls and then we got half a dozen more to get into before we score the glass guys so let's just uh keep on working cheers okay guys so g pen is gonna stick right alongside with that vuber and get a seven out of ten honestly the overall flavor and experience wasn't strong enough it wasn't potent enough to really get me that much more excited than it was through the uber there was little hints and nods leaning that way but nothing to push me to say you need to score it this just didn't have that that that torque or the emphasis on the flavor and the experience that i'd be looking for to give it that type of score you guys which personally i find a little bit disappointing but there's not much you can do about it except for uh dive into the glass see how it tastes you're here we're going to go through our boomer battery two standard rips and then we preheat the highest temp before we uh buck on over to the g pen and do it through our 420 rig you guys but like the uh the glass says we're all mad here and let's uh start snapping these ball back cheers and uh let's hope we get higher than a seven from the rigs cheers second rip diving in oh preheat the last one y'all cheers okay guys uber battery through the rig honestly not much changed there was just a little bit of more um issue on the haul like the cart didn't really want to um flow that smoothly and it could have been the rig it could have been the adapter there's a lot of a lot of things that play a factor into that that being said flavor-wise there was no change there's honestly just a little bit of a drop off on the intensity of the flavor which personally big disappointment for me not something i would really look forward to or dot want to dive into uh through the uber battery in the water but it was that gassy flavor and i was almost expecting that to start to take a little bit of a damp air and it typically does take a little bit of a dampening when we run it through the water those earthy cushy more rich and intense flavors seem to like to pop off once we add the rig into the game and that's a part of the reason why we do it you guys that we can experience these cartridges as many different ways as we can and really see what they have to offer but first and foremost we got the lowest temp and then we dive into the second and we preheat the last just like we did with the vuber let's get this one going before we can score the rigs you guys cheers and i'll see you on the other side preheat that last one cheers okay guys so moving this cartridge over into the glass honestly didn't do it didn't do it any favors i'm giving it a 6 out of a 10 for the glass the loss of that gas kind of hint for the g pen and the overall gassy flavor through the uber was a little bit of a detriment to this cartridge itself it really did lose any and all flavor intensity that it had on the batteries in and of itself personally i definitely preferred the flavor from the jeep end because it had more of that cushy kind of a lean and on the higher temperatures it seemed to have a little bit more of the flavor i'm curious if we go into this card a little bit deeper if you start to get a little bit more of that richer flavor as the oil starts to get continuously reheated and if it's more of a transitional flavor from the initial to the one that we're going to get at the end and with it being a one gram cartridge there there is a little bit of the transition like the cushman's at the start and the cushions at the end are a little bit of a different experience the cushions at the start had a lot of that strong menthol cooling experience where now i don't have that much of that experience coming off of it but more so just that really rich minty like almost like a spearmint gum cooling but definitely more on the sweet side for the overall experience and it's just more the breakdown of the oil as you're heating it and it's not necessarily being smoked that heating and cooling breaks things down changes the changes the overall experience and as the cartridges are used the actual heating element in and of itself starts to break down and wear out a little bit so it that changes as you go through and use these cartridges so there's a lot to factor in with overall experience i think i am going to grow on this cartridge the more i smoke it but for this review it's all right it honestly is an all right experience moving from the six out of ten for the glass we're gonna be going to give it an eight out of a ten for a high the experience that comes from this cartridge is definitely the most enjoyable portion of it not saying that the flavor is bad it's just the highs more what i enjoy from the bubba kush line but it kind of gives me the lighter side of it so i'm a big fan of the bubba kush strains because they give you a little bit of that kind of mental ease emotional um lift where it's just not worrying about things you're not really feeling any of the anxieties or any of that type of stress all the time it's definitely more when it's immediate whatever's causing those type of feelings is immediately in front like the forefront of your mind then you still feel the the anxiety the nervousness stuff like that but it's definitely not um a it like you almost need to work to feel like that and i'm a big fan of that strain because it just helps slow everything down it helps focus on one thing at a time like it really does just overall ease everything and it really is a strain that i like to smoke coming into the evening when i'm going to sit down play some video games or gonna sit down and get into a movie this is a cartridge i could sit down and smoke throughout a movie and come the end of it have a nice good buzz built up from the entirety of the length but with that being said it's not something that hits with any sort of major intensity at the beginning and that's a little bit of a disappointment for me i would like like when i blink this thing when i use the the battery to its to what it determines its timeout value i want to exhale and feel a nice little hit from these cartridges not it doesn't need to be anything crazy but it should be enough that i can feel a nice little buzz for five or ten minutes and i don't know if this cartridges will be able to do that after i've had some flour like recently or anything along those lines i just i don't know if it has that oomph to it to really pick it up because right now it's got decent decent hit but not necessarily the strongest and that's why the eight is the best i can give it because it's got some enjoyable qualities it's got some some of that some of the things i look for but it doesn't really have that intensity and the whole from the flower that really gives those flower strains the nines and tens for the experience and the high because they do that body lock and that mental drift with um the cartridges just coming in with the body ease and the mental lift it's very very light versions of what you can really expect from the flower and honestly i am much more of the flower experience and overall flavor in comparison to this cartridge so with that a 28 out of 40 i think is a good honest score for this cartridge i don't know if much more than just a flavor increase for me personally would bump the scores up on this one um for those of you guys who are checking it out um definitely let me know down below what you think i would personally recommend this to new to experienced smokers it does hit does have a nice high so the newer smokers tread lightly take your time with it ease into this cartridge because it could put you on your ass if you're not expecting uh if you're not expecting the intensity of that kind of body creep that it can build up to then the more experienced smokers you're going to enjoy that little bit of a buzz but i don't know if uh you have any anything of a real tolerance if it's gonna hit you guys the way that you're looking for so definitely it's a good functioning cartridge good tasting cartridge it gives you a decent high but i wouldn't say it's top of the line or the top thing on the market um for what it's worth i enjoyed it i'm definitely gonna enjoy smoking the rest of the cartridge i just i don't think i'll be buying a second one of this with that you guys let's let's wrap this one up we're uh gonna

the tropic girl scout cookies cartridge from general emission i'm really excited to see how this one's going to do and honestly how this lp is going to do since it's new to the market and this strain is a new cartridge as well i am quite excited to see how it's going to taste how it's going to hit and how overall it functions you guys we've got a little bit of a modified review for it but we're still going to get everything and all the components that we typically do so let's get into the intro and actually get this review going guys cheers and i'll see you on the other side okay welcome back you guys so as i said in the intro we're going to be diving into general admissions tropic girl scout cookies cartridge the thc total on this sucker came in with an 87.6 percent a cbd total of zero and a package date of august 21st 2020 so that is the information that we have on the box and sadly that's all the information that i have right now i looked and i couldn't find anything online honestly i didn't take a whole bunch of time to try and find anything so if you guys do please re reach out and let me know down in the comments or if you're watching this after this video goes live and you are able to find that site with the information on it please let me know down below so we can share with everyone that checks this video out but with that we've also got to let you know about the modification for this review you guys and for the ones coming in the future my fireside battery has actually died i am down to just strictly my g pen battery so if you guys want to let me know what your preferable company for batteries or if there's certain ones you guys want me to check out and look i will be starting to look into a second higher quality 510 vape battery that um will probably into transition into kind of a review and a comparison to this g pen you guys really love that fireside but it just it started to die on me and it just slowly didn't hold the charge it just it was it i got my money's worth out of it and uh yeah you guys i think that's everything we've got for the information for this cartridge so let's just dive right into it get into uh the taste from a g pen before we uh move into the glass talk about the high in the overall you guys we've got the urban scale intro coming in right now and we're gonna see on the other side [Music] welcome back you guys so let's slide this cartridge out and take a look i'm actually not minding the pink whatsoever and all of the general emission ones you do get that ga on there the bar code and then the one two zero because this is their thc dominant cart they've got two thc dominant cards they've got the tropic girl scout cookies and the berry g33 and then they have the lemon ice and the tropic thunder which are going to be a two to one and a one to one cartridge i've tried the tropic thunder and i didn't mind it not overwhelming with the flavor not really a powerful high but it's it's a nice cartridge for just during the day and giving you a decent little head buzz but um you know what you guys let's dive into this see how this uh cartridge is gonna go these thc stickers that they got on the general emission they're well stuck on there so we ain't getting that sucker off in this video so let's just get to uh seeing how the taste of g pen is start on the lowest temperature talk about that we go to medium temperature talk about that then we finish it off on the high before we start running our way through the glass you guys we're gonna get all that done and talk about it while we're smoking it so let's get into it you guys cheers and i'll see on the other side wow very very fruity like sunny d fruity you guys i i was not expecting that at all okay if that's what we're gonna be tasting throughout you guys this cartridge is gonna easily transition into uh my personal favorite but that was just a first taste let's see what the second one does on the second temperature cheers i don't know how but it managed to get sweeter you guys on that second temperature it really is that sunny d like the orange juice you get at a resort when you're visiting down mexico cuba way like just the sugar with the taste of orange it's essentially natural tang it's tang with a little bit of added orange juice kind of flavor right just that that's super sweet super citrus flavor you guys this this is a card that i could definitely get myself into trouble with because i just want to haul on it for the flavor now now that we got the highest temp set on here you guys i am very curious to see if this gonna [ __ ] up with that flavor if it's gonna keep pushing the um that holiday juice that's what we're gonna call it that holiday juice kind of flavor you guys but um for the time being let's let's see how the highest temp does on this g pen y'all cheers without question you guys 10 out of a 10 for the g pen it is really overwhelmingly sweet and powerful with its flavor i i was not expecting that experience throughout any and it stayed with that kind of holiday juice that sunny d the resort like just the the sugared but still very natural tasting in um like not being the artificial orange it's just that really super concentrated sweet natural orange flavor and that's what i'm getting you guys and 10 out of 10 is i don't even have to think about it i'm giving it 10 because i can sit here and just haul on that cart all day until it's gone i would just get zombied on that cart because of how enjoyable the flavor is which is not something i typically would say with uh with a 510 cartridge lately any of the butt i've been trying since it's been a little bit on that peppery side but it's uh time to dive into the glass you guys and see how it holds up there i i think it's gonna do quite well honestly um if we continue with the type of flavors we're gonna get this sucker's gonna be the closest thing to a perfect square we're gonna have you guys and it'll be the cartridge to compare but we're gonna dive into the glass and see how it is we run through these quick three rips and i'm gonna take it through all six rips three on this rig three on the 420 rig because i'm not going to cheap you guys out on the glass rips as well it gives us a little bit of a different function a little bit of a different experience and we're going to pre-heat on our last rip in each of the glass because it's our highest temperature you guys i'll see you after we're done these six rips because there's no point in stopping and talking until we're always done cheers and i'll see you on the other side preheat let's dive it let's dive into it with the other rig you guys three rips let's get through it cheers lowest tamp to the highest him let's go last hand preheat let's go guys so the glass is gonna get an eight out of a ten honestly i want to give it that ten i really do but it doesn't have the hold over or the like the consistency with the flavor that i would want to be able to give it that 10. it really doesn't just it hits but it doesn't hold you guys and that's and that is the big disappointment how smooth it was through the glass was unreal the fact that i was able to get those three rips boom boom boom is huge and that's not something that i typically get with the with the vaporizer you guys i'm usually dying in between the second and the third hoot well i'm not not really dying but i got a good a good hack fest going but um honestly really enjoyable just doesn't have the hold over that i would be looking for and wanting for it to be ripped through the glass more often you guys it's way way better just through the pen even just little bits just little tasty tastes it is tasty but we're going to give it an 8 out of 10 for the high um first it hit really really heavy and i was like ah like i was i was worried after taking the ribs to the jeep head but it hit really heavy and it came on really really heavy um and it it also could have been the fact that i hadn't had much to smoke so my body was just a little bit having a thc rush at the beginning but now that it's come on and it's settled a little bit and we're about 15 minutes into it it's nice and mellow and mild and it's something that if you want that stupid head rush you'll get it right away but it'll pass relatively quickly for a nice easy uplifting mellow um like it's very easy and mellow and how it comes on to effect but it's very much an uplifting slightly mental drift like it's it's on the edge there and if you smoke too much of it it could go put you into that heavy mental drift area but all in all a really well balanced cartridge for beginning of the day midday for a heavier smoker you guys that are new to them tread carefully because they could put you in a [ __ ] hole but with uh the high getting the eight out of a 10 it rounds out at a nice 26 out of 30. and for uh the three categories that did really well the g pen is so tasty and honestly my biggest talking point about this cartridge i absolutely love it i already can think of a handful of people who would enjoy it as well just because they really do like that citrus flavor that i like as well but there's also chunk people that i'm just gonna avoid recommending it to because they don't want anything that tastes like citrus so overall really really enjoyable really tasty and i'm i'm quite impressed with how well this cartridge did from a general mission and you guys kudos coming from me because you guys put out a hell of a good product but for the time being i'm uh i'm gonna take a rip off of this i gotta go get some cardio done and then i will be right back to record our weekly review weekly wrap up whatever you guys however you guys want to approach and call that i've been calling it the wrap up for the review they both work they're interchangeable yes interchangeable but to uh to wrap this week up i wanted to do cartridge review so we could talk a little bit about it but this will be uploaded on sunday so you guys weekly wrap up link will be in the corner go and check that out but for the time being we're gonna have the sucker up end card's gonna slide in here you hover over my logo and click that bell notification when you subscribe so that you know anytime one of my videos go live we've been keeping up with at least six posts a week you guys and i want to keep that consistency up and rolling you guys are loving it i'm loving it let's keep it rolling you guys let's keep it chugging along but we're gonna wrap this one up bottom two videos go and check either those out most recommended for you and most recently uploaded cheers y'all and i will be back later with some more content you", "TwOZizw1DhQ": "hey y'all trevor here with red of the leaf and today we're going to be tapping into an indica dominant 510 vape cartridge you guys suggested the lp pure sun farms white rhino is the strain that we'll be getting into today cheers and i'll see you guys on the other side of the intro when we're rattling off the information and tap it into this vaporizer you guys i'm excited hope you guys are too see on the other side welcome back you guys so as i said in the intro we are going to be going into pure sun farms new addition to the market their 510 vape cartridge the strain that i selected from pure sun farms is going to be the white rhino indica dominant strain it came with a thc total of 80.6 percent and a cbd total of 0.18 percent cbd and it was packaged on the 29th of july 2020 so i did mention it in the intro it was suggested by one of you guys to check out this lp because they are new to market and their price is relatively reasonable this sucker came in at only 32 bucks for the half grammer which is a really really nice starting point for what i'm hoping for is good quality because the strain that's in there is one that i've found uh to be a personal favorite of mine for that kind of lighter indica effect it's not something that knocks me on on my ass hiccups already before we do a vape review what's going on here um it's not something that kicks my ass but it is something that has a specific appeal for the effects that i'm looking for you guys and uh it definitely does that for me so i've got the information pulled up on the leafly website i'm gonna quickly rattle that off before we go on into the full review you guys so the pure sun farms 510 vape cartridges are filled with 0.5 grams of full spectrum single strain whole bud extracts and nothing else just pure bc cannabis providing smooth clean flavor with every pull white rhino is an indica dominant strain selected for its fruity flavors of blueberries and mangoes meristening terpene the green grapes alpha pinene and the thai basil the carofyline carefully preserved in a terpene-rich extract fitted with a custom ceramic mouthpiece and featuring a glass tank and ceramic heating coil huge huge if this is actually ceramic you guys that is a huge benefit that pure sun farms is going to have over any other company and i'm i that excites me beyond belief to see that you guys i'm hoping it is ceramic versus the metal and it's featuring every component of pure sun farms cartridges is thoroughly tested for quality and safety okay you guys since i saw the ceramic i am really really excited i am definitely a man that prefers ceramic over metal um just for the flavors that it puts off and anything along those lines um it definitely ranks quartz ceramic metal for me for any of my concentrates so if this is a ceramic core you guys i think this card's gonna do well just based off of that but the only way we're gonna find out is by cracking into this container and trying this cartridge out i will see you guys on the other side when uh we lift this lid up and see what we got working with us working with us working for us there we go working for us in this review on this cart y'all let's get that urban scale review going and i'll see you on the other side [Music] there we go got that lid popped off what do we have what do we have [Music] oh first and foremost to start off pure sun farms really beautiful looking cartridge overall that is definitely ceramic on the inside there oh that is a very very sharp looking card pierce on farms nice nice placement of the logo on there oh that thc sticker is on there good i don't think we're going to be able to get that one off you guys but we're going to start out with the fireside battery let's screw that on there and see how she looks definitely a cartridge that looks good on these batteries we're going to start out at the lowest temperature before we bump it up to the medium and the highest on this fireside battery after that we switch on over into the jeep and run it through the exact same way you guys before we go on to the fireside battery again and do it all over again but through our glass rigs right here we have two different size rigs two different perks on them the the hemper adapter ready to use as well but um that's gonna be everything y'all it is about time that we get going on this review hope you guys are ready to get rocking because i definitely am and uh let's see how this cart does you guys i'm expecting good things cheers and uh i'll see you on the other side of this rip when we start talking about how it does with the lowest temperature on this battery to your show [Music] very light flavor definitely getting touches of that pine flavor a little bit of the berries but nothing overwhelming it was really smooth really light and a nice experience on uh on that side you guys we've got it up to the second temperature of the blue and uh let's see if that changes the game up if we add a little bit more heat to this oil y'all cheers and i'll see you guys on the other side it's still that really sweet mango piney kind of flavor you guys and i'm i'm enjoying it cheers okay so hmm uh let's let it sit for a second you guys um still getting that piney flavor i'm still getting a little bit of that sweeter mango flavor but not not very much i do have kind of that pepper burn on the back of my throat and i could taste it at the beginning when it was under temp like when it was under heat i could taste it but not so much afterwards which is interesting you guys it's definitely not something i was expected or expecting from this cart this early especially in that medium temperature but we got a bite of that baby that that carefully and that kind of peppery taste in the back i still am enjoying this we've got it set to the highest temperature now let's see if we get spicy or get sweet you guys but the only way we're gonna find out is by finding out so let's go ahead and do that you guys red tamp on the fire side before we move on over to the g-pad [Music] cheers okay guys so we've got to switch over to the g pen and before i go into any read real detail i'm going to give it a 9 out of 10 for the score um flavor was really enjoyable and actually quite decent to uh experience that fireside battery the lower temperatures were definitely more my preference where it's the richer more herbal mango type of flavor versus the spicier kind of peppered flavors at the higher level and i found that at the higher levels the flavor intensity was a lot stronger to like at the onset when you're taking your first taste but after after you let it pass a little bit it tends to disappoint it tends to fade very quickly where the lower temperatures found i found stuck around a little while longer it's it really tried to develop its flavor on your tongue and really put out the um the best potential that this bud or the bud or the cartridge had to offer you guys and it's enjoyable just not a hundred percent the biggest thing i will say that has given this thing huge points is how smooth the cartridge is to haul from this is probably one of the smoothest cartridges i've had when you light it up you just almost immediately get very smooth rapid draw from this cart and that's that's definitely big kudos to uh pure sun farms for doing that and putting that quality out especially with the ceramic you guys i'm i'm really really loving it i can i personally am tasting a little bit of a difference just a smoother cleaner draw but now that we've got it on the g pen we're gonna take our rips through here you guys before we move on and start smoking through the glass i'll see on the other side of uh this first taste y'all cheers okay so definitely more pine i am getting a little bit of the um a little bit of that beta-carotene a little bit of kind of that rich herbal flavor uh as well it's definitely not as fruity or as enjoyable vanish of an initial flavor in comparison to the fireside but it still is putting out a really nice flavor you guys and i'm actually not as disappointed as i could be with uh with the flavor that this cartridge is putting up so far we've got it to the second temperature i'm curious to see if the pepper is going to have more to play and more to say with this battery than it did with the fireside you guys but you all know the only way we're going to find out is by trying it okay definitely not anywhere near as much pepper on the g pen versus the uh the fire side it's and what is there is a late setter i'm starting to really feel it become dominant right now the overall flavor and presentation this butt has is nice and balanced it's got kind of that fruity touch that blends on over into a little bit more of an herbal flavor and it and it has that peppery tone as kind of an overwash for both of them to balance them out and i'm enjoying it so far you guys quite a bit and i'm looking forward to seeing what the highest temperature in that red batteries is gonna do for us for affecting how much carefully flavor and effects we start to feel you guys but um as you know what we're going to find out is okay guys i'm gonna give the g pen a nine out of ten as well it honestly didn't have the same sweetness and flavor and experience that i had through the fire side it honestly flavor weight flavor determinant it wasn't the best tasting strain or cartridge that i've had through the functionality of it was what really kept its point up points up on the g pen it was really smooth it hit heavy the terpene domination throughout the flavor was really really available for me to enjoy like i could pick out the different flavors and really enjoy the combination of the effects and it that honestly having the ceramic heating coil and the the ceramic mouthpiece the ceramic i find just tastes better you guys personally i'm a huge fan of ceramic over metal if i could have bought a e-nail with a ceramic bowl or ceramic nail to it i would have 100 percent bought that just purely so that my alternative option is more where my preference is and more when i like to smoke because i'm really more of a s of a quartz ceramic kind of a combo versus that quartz metal that some other folks tend to enjoy but enough jabbing about that we've got the fireside battery screwed back in and lowered to the lowest temp and ready to go we got the hamper adapter a dab huh plugged in up top we're gonna plug that sucker into the rig and uh take ourselves some tastes of this 510 cartridge from pure sun farms i am uh really excited to see how uh how this is going to turn out you guys but for the time being let's get to trying it and i'll see after the last of uh these three hoots when i'm giving you a little bit of a rundown on how it tastes and just so you know that last hoot the highest temp we preheat that sucker because do last pull preheating i'll cheers okay guys so we got the cartridge loaded up on the jeep and ready to go i found that the flavor through the fireside and the glass was enjoyable it had a good kind of peppery berry flavor to it that actually combined really well and made a good overall effect and enjoyable experience from from this cartridge you guys and i was i was not expecting that through the glass to actually just explode and accentuate the strains that not the strains with the terpenes and the flavors that i was really enjoying through just the vaporizer so i'm quite curious to see how it's gonna do through the g pen and through a little bit of a bigger rig you guys but same setup as before three rips three different temperatures last one we preheat and then we rock it through the rig so let's start on the lowest temp and work our way up and see how it does for the g pen i'll see you guys after that when uh we'll give you the score out of 10 for the glass the high and then we'll mark up the uh out of 40 overall y'all see on the other side when we're through these three reps [Music] cheers let's preheat that sucker and get going cheers okay yes i'm gonna give this an eight out of a ten for the uh taste from a glass it has a very similar flavor overall to what i was getting through the batteries which is really enjoyable and it's definitely a flavor that i would look forward to smoking but if it's just what i'm getting through the vaporizers themselves then there's really no benefit in me going and putting it through a clean rig or preloading a bong with it because i'm not really getting that unique or individual flavor which the ones that i typically like to pre-fill my bongs with or anything along those lines or ones that i can match up with maybe a little bit blander tasting flower when i'm smoking it so that the cartridge is a more definite and more intense flavor that i'm experiencing and enjoying and that's really what i try to aim to do with when i'm do preloading rigs and uh this just didn't have that intensity and variety so that's why i'm only giving it an 8 out of 10 you guys for a high though easily 9 out of a 10. has a really strong cerebral based relaxation mental drift to it it does well work your welk it does work its way down along your back and right along your spine i'm feeling it doesn't go much further than that like it's kind of the back straps the chunk of muscle right around here your spine is is all i'm feeling for intensity for myself and a little bit disappointing there but still a very well balanced high and enjoyable from the onset so a 9 out of 10 is easy easily able to be the uh the best scorer for it but wrapping up this overall you guys it's going to end up with a 35 out of 40. i still did incredibly well had a good overall flavor and experience through both the jeep and the fireside battery and it really did um it really did catch me off guard with how much enjoyment i could have from a really simple tasting and raw tasting strain and i did enjoy that quite a bit you guys and i think these uh ceramic ceramic tanks are definitely going to be something that'll uh slowly start to take over the market because i have a feeling that there's more folks out there like me than than not or just people haven't had the chance to try the ceramic and i really really do suggest it if you get the chance to try dabbing or doing anything off a ceramic bowl versus a metal i i think you guys will enjoy it but for the time being let's uh take one more haul and wrap this video up when mine card comes in up in the corner will be my logo if you hover over that you can click

going on guys it's jimmy the camera guy here and today we're going over the riot verb 510 device before i get into the actual device i'll show you the contents of the box we have a micro usb charger here your riot verb user manual as well as two magnetic adapters one for your smaller half gram carts and one for your regular full gram cartridges there now let's get into the device i'm liking this desert tan almost camo look very cool this is a zippo style device as you see there first thing i do notice about the device is how light it is almost feels like there's nothing in your hand usb charger at the bottom 650 milliamp battery takes approximately 45 minutes to one hour to charge it does have uh it does come with variable voltage as well as preheat and here you have your little window this is uh straight through there's no glass or plastic in between that or anything move this to the side here we'll turn this device on one two three four five as you see the light will blink signifying that the unit is on right there it is the green color which is your lowest voltage setting which is 3.0 volts one two three that goes to the middle setting at 3.4 volts one two three that goes to your highest setting at 3.8 volts the riot also comes with a 10 second preheat simply press this button twice one two and then you'll see the device start to flash there it'll cycle through this rainbow type of color and there you then you have 10 seconds to hit your device to cancel the preheat one two oops sorry one two preheat is now cancelled we'll try the device now uh this is a half mil cartridge with the full size magnetic adapter drop that in there as you see closes very nice you even see a light up once the device closes there and then i'll pop in a full gram as well with the smaller magnetic adapter so you can see how that fits as well very simple nifty device you do not want to put a swap magnetic adapters on cartridges so here you'll see i'll take the half gram one i'll put it on the full gram and the device will not be able to close so try to keep your magnetic adapter with the appropriate cartridge and now in the moment you've been waiting for i'll go ahead and utilize the device i have some regular e-juice in here a half gram cartridge with the adapter i am currently on the highest setting which is 3.8 volts and simply by me pressing this button you'll probably be able to hear some sizzle in there hold on one second there you go so now i'll go ahead and give the device a hit and it produces some good flavor nothing tastes burnt close this throw

something that i've had a lot of requests to review it's the pink kush 510 vape cartridge now this is from san rafael which is a brand under the license producer med relief which i believe is also co-owned by aurora cannabis which is a huge sort of cannabis brand license producer here in canada it retails on the ontario cannabis store for 32.95 and that's for 0.3 grams of cannabis oil so i want to do a little bit of math here that i think will help to clarify some of those numbers that you guys might see on the ontario canvas store and help you make better decisions about what to buy so if we break it down at 32.95 that's 10.98 per 0.1 gram of cannabis oil now to compare i did a review a little bit back on the marley natural black vape cartridge which i consider to be a very good quality cartridge and that retailed for 52.95 on the ontario cannabis store but it was for 0.5 grams of cannabis oil so if we break that down it was 10.59 per 0.1 gram so pink kush was 10.98 per 0.1 gram the marley natural was 10.59 per 0.1 gram now what's the range okay so what is a good price what is expensive so on the ontario cannabis store the range of uh prices that you see for these 510 cartridges is between 6.79 per point one gram at the lower end of the range and at the very high or high end of the range it's 12.99 per 0.1 gram so this falls somewhere in the mid to mid high range in terms of price point okay so hope that clarifies that point uh now pink kush is a strain of cannabis that is grown for san rafael by med relief i'm assuming and it's an indica dominant strain and it's very rich in terpenes um we'll talk about the flavor soon uh what else it uh i like this part on the description it's in the description on the ontario cannabis store it says contains no fillers and no dilutive agents okay so we know that it's a clean cannabis oil the percentage of thc in this one is 65.8 percent to 77.5 percent and they call that very strong a very strong product on the ontario canvas store in my opinion i would say that it's i my opinion differs a little bit i would say that it's a strong product but i've had very strong products and this is not a very strong product i would say this is a strong product it's not a weak product it's not very strong it's somewhere in the middle so i'm going to go into a little bit of my experience with this and then what i really want to do to kind of conclude everything is to compare this to the pink kush disposable pen which i reviewed previously uh let's first talk about flavor so i would give this full marks for flavor it was delightful it is floral it's fruity it really reminded me of elderflower i don't know if you've guys ever had like an elder flower like soda or something with elderflower in it but that's what this really reminded me of in terms of flavor the vapor was it's not the harshest vapor that i've had but it's also not the smoothest vapor i had it's somewhere in the middle uh in terms of the vapor quality the effects so the effects come on uh you know pretty soon after taking your first dose much like the all the other vape cartridges and in terms of how long it lasts same amount of time as most of the other vape cartridges you know i would say anywhere from like an hour to an hour and a half and then it slowly dies off after that so no major differences with this one compared to others in terms of onset of effect and duration of effect now the quality of the effects so i found this to be very calming and soothing and it doesn't have much of a body effect so there was a little little body effect with this one um the really sort of surprising thing for me was that i how unfoggy in terms of like my thinking it made me feel i was very much able to get work done uh while taking this so like at night time you know i'd have a dose and then i could still do some some work on the computer no problem with the marley natural black no chance that thing just knocks me on my feet i can't do anything except watch tv but this one i could actually kind of be productive which which i sort of like that's pretty much it for this i'd say like the biggest drawbacks uh for me was the fact that it didn't have much of a body effect uh i like a little bit of a body effect um and um yeah that's pretty much the only major drawback from this one what i really want to do now is compare this to the i think i've got it somewhere oh i didn't even show you guys what this all looks like okay so let me open this up so this is how it comes when you buy it in this box here with these tabs if you could see them there's two and it's a very similar system to some of the other cartridges you open the top like this you have to push in both tabs at the same time and that releases this plastic container inside which has your vape cartridge right there take that out here's the cartridge so you could see it's quite small it's smaller than definitely some of the other ones i've purchased because i think a lot of other ones are 0.5 grams and this one's a 0.3 gram but it's good to know that sort of price per 0.1 gram which which i talked about so here you go that screws into your 510 battery like so and then you're good to go now let's compare that to here's the pink kush disposable pen which i've reviewed before now the disposable pen retails for 27.95 on the ontario cannabis store but it only has 0.15 grams of oil this one has three double the amount and is it double the price no not even close this one if you remember 32.95 27.95 so we're talking like less than 10 difference and this contains double the amount of oil now quality not even close this one garbage this one very good that disposable pen in my opinion the quality of the vapor the flavor the effect total garbage for me it tasted like burnt oil um i just mainly got like a headache from it no major effects and i didn't even close to taste the nuances of the terpenes that i got with the 510 system so please if you're considering uh purchasing uh vape in general don't go for the disposable pens go for some sort of vape system like the 510 system or the pac system or buy yourself a good quality vaporizer that can do oils and dry flour don't go for the disposable pens they're overpriced the quality is garbage go for one of these okay so that's my piece on that now how am i going to rate this uh so in terms of so price point uh i think is on the money because i i liked it it was it was good quality and it's not on the higher end which i don't think it should be and it's not on the lower end which probably shouldn't be either maybe if they dropped the price a dollar or two i'd be a little bit more happy but uh price point pretty good flavor 10 out of 10 full marks for that effect um just shy of what i'd like it to be i really like that body effect really didn't have any of that body effect for me so i'm going to take off a mark on on the effect the quality of the effect and uh i think just one mark off i'm trying to think i'm trying to nitpick at this product uh other than that i really like it so um you know what i like i feel weird giving this a nine out of ten but like i'm inclined to give this a 9 out of 10 but there's something drawing me back so i'm going to be a little conservative and i'm going to give this a strong 8 and a half out of 10. overall a very good vape i liked it a lot and i hope you enjoyed that review so i'll see you next time for another cannabis product review", "yaz3a5lNY88": "hello everybody it's nikki i have a cool video for you today i had just got my order in i've been waiting waiting waiting for this package i have never tried it before but it is a cbd oil vape it's legal and i want to try it all right so cbd is totally not like thc

this was more money this was much more money okay so this is the vape pen i believe it says and this is the bubble gum honey bubble gum flavor pure and clear so i got this because it doesn't have like all those types of i don't know explain it it says no pg or vg that's a type of ingredient they use that's supposed to be not good for you and i heard so i don't know i just got this this is organic hemp slim and lightweight adjustable heap settings preheat functions vape pen hemp oil concentrate cannabis derived tested pure blah blah blah mind body spirit fast acting really so this is 250 milligrams and this is 200 milligrams this is not bad for 20 200 milligrams for like 500 puffs or something i said i don't know but this is 250 milligrams what does it mean to experience pure spectrum enlightenment intuition creativity compassion vitality relationships and grounding this is like chakra status guys this is chakra the promoting chakra status so let's open the vape pen it slides out i'm so excited to try this uh it's stuck here we go oh it's just a charger with a sleek pen all right see it looks like this all right and then this is the charger that goes with it a usb charger if you had any of this before you just screw that in i guess do i have to charge it now is there any instructions oh here we go has a little bit of instructions they gave me silver i don't know if i chose silver specifically but on off settings push button five times change heat settings push button three times preheating set settings push button two times charging up to four hours or when light turns green okay so i don't know if it's charged yet doesn't say and this is my oil it looks like this they had this one that was called fruit fruity loops i was gonna try but i didn't know if this fit inside the thing i wanted to use but look it looks like this and the top is rounded and the oil is in there i don't know if you've seen that but um the oil's in there in the reservoir it's pretty cool all right let's stop this cheddar chatter and try it hopefully it's charged i really hope so i'm gonna go ahead and screw this in 0.5 ml that's how much okay okay i don't know how tight i'm supposed to why is it crooked is it crooked this is weird all right okay so what is it how do you do this charging press button two times i hope it's on oh on off one two three four five oh look it was red now one two it's preheating now it's preheating pictures of products are not to scale cartridge not included how come this tip is different from the other tips the other tips look like they're like more not not as rounded is it done now what do you do i don't know how to do this you have to hold the pen you have to hold the button i mean so bubble gum tastes like a weird light version of medicine let me try again it's like i don't know what it's supposed to do at the moment this is just interesting it's like i feel like it's something supposed to happen like right away it's light i taste a little tint of bubble gum but it's very subtle very subtle i don't see no nothing as of now but it's pretty cool i don't know let's try one more that's cool though maybe i'll feel an effect later i feel like i feel like i don't know if it's the placebo effect but i feel like a calmness settling or i could just be bugging out i don't know but this is cool i guess i'll do an update on another video to see my thoughts on it like some vlog type stuff so that's it that's all i have for you today i'm gonna do some more videos so check those out i'll see you next time bye you", "tqqY_aVF_hM": "[Music] [Music] hey everyone dr sean miravichy here and it's time for another cannabis product review today by popular request i'm reviewing the sativa dominant trailblazer spark torch this is a 510 cartridge for the 510 vape system it retails for 40.95 on the ontario cannabis store and that's for 0.5 grams of oil so you do get quite a bit of oil in this cartridge eight dollars 19 cents have to be precise for 0.1 grams which puts it right in the middle range of price point on your vape cartridges so as i mentioned it's a sativa dominant strain that they're using here it's 70.5 to 78 thc which makes it a very strong vape cartridge and i would agree with that very strong label it is quite strong in the description they list a lot of terpenes in this particular oil and they do make a point to say that it is terpene rich and i would agree with that and we'll get into the flavor in just a moment the licensed producer is organogram they have a few brands under their label one other brand that i've done a review for in the past is edison uh their cannabis is grown in new bra in moncton new brunswick and so they have a really sort of state-of-the-art facility there and uh it's quality tested and all that stuff this is how it comes from uh act i actually bought it at a local dispensary actually went to a new dispensary this time dutch love so shout out to dutch love they're located or the branch i went to was located on leslie street here in toronto really nice looking place it's like a hipster loft and very friendly service so this is how it looks so you have this familiar tab box system so let me open it up for you you got the two tabs here so you push those together and then you can kind of scoop out the inner package all right so there it is and take out your cartridge i had it upside down okay there's the cartridge so uh one thing to note here that's really cool is the see-through mouthpiece i don't know if you guys can see that that well but the mouthpiece here is completely it's like some sort of loose site i guess i don't know if that's the right term it's like a plastic a see-through plastic so i haven't seen one like that before so pretty cool they also have a ceramic atomizer which is a pretty high quality atomizer which makes for a good vape experience um so that's it about the cartridge here um pretty cool let's talk about flavor so uh with the flavor definitely picking up on uh hold on let me get this back in the box before i start flexing around with it okay so the flavor definitely prominent citrusy uh flavors going on a lot of those sort of citrusy terpenes coming forward which is pretty typical with your sativas so definitely detected those probably some limonene in there for sure and the vape quality wasn't harsh pretty smooth uh the experience so i could see why a lot of you guys like this particular cartridge however i wasn't a huge fan so to start with it is quite strong so it hits you in a very strong way after you know a few minutes after vaping it it's definitely got a euphoric feel to it um definitely feel like very uplifted and happy and giggly right off the bat but i did find so i use this for about a week because i want to with every cartridge i review i want to use it for about a week so that i get like an average of my total experience with it so i can give you a pretty good sense of of what it's like and each time that that feeling is pretty short-lived so within about it's it's over for me in about 30 to 45 minutes and then comes this sort of like burn out kind of phase for me where um it leaves you feeling pretty dopey uh pretty heavy but not sedating so it's not like you feel like you have to take a nap i just felt like kind of you know like high really high uh really dopey so i could see how that's um you know attractive or or good first for some of you guys but when i'm choosing a sativa i really uh i'm choosing a sativas to be productive uh i want something that's going to kind of wake me up get me going making me feel good so i can like get to work do things during the daytime i didn't feel that way really with this one i was kind of out of it it took me a long time to like get thoughts through but if you're just like kind of relaxing and hanging out going for walks outside i could see this being a pretty good sativa choice for you a mild body effect with this one it was mostly a heady experience a slight body effect uh and you guys know if you watch my reviews i like a body effect but you know i don't typically find uh too much of a body effect with the sativas that's more of an indica thing for me uh so there was a mild body effect with that one and um that's about it for this uh for the trailblazer i don't want to go on and on and ramble i think i've got all the uh really important points forward the one last thing that i found with this one which is kind of a question mark if you look at the ingredients it says uh it has a flavoring agent in it and i'm not sure if that's just the terpenes i i kind of think it's just the terpenes they're talking about so those would be natural but if there is like artificial flavoring agents in it that don't want any of those so if you guys know for sure definitely leave it in the comments and tell me what you thought what do you think about the trailblazer 510 cartridge i would be really interested to know your thoughts so leave me comments leave me questions and please subscribe as always i really find your comments amazing and i try to look at all of them as much as possible and the subscriptions really help me out keep me motivated to keep reviewing stuff for you guys so uh lastly the rating i'm going to give this one a strong 7 out of 10. it's a it's a good cartridge it's just not my cup of tea but i could see why some of you guys like it all right that's it for now i'll be back with another review for you shortly", "7ffGkryYVMM": "before this video starts i want to say shout out to the reddit family and if you came here from that make sure you guys leave a comment down below let's get into this [Music] yo yo what's good youtube this is two stone for you and today we're back with another 510 cartridge today we're going to be smoking on some fire og so yeah let's get into this review so this fire og 510 cartridge is by the brand hex go i picked this up on the ocs website for 3150 for a half gram of this shatter dislike whatever you want to call it and that's honestly not a bad price at all for this strain it's clocking in at 75 to 85 percent thc as you can see here our batch is 81 percent so that is actually relatively high the plant type is a hybrid you can pause the screen right here and read all the information you like this product is a co2 extraction but enough of that and let's actually get into the review when i did buy this actually i took off the duty stamp because i did intend on smoking it but then i was like wait wait wait let's make a video on this because uh you know i'm sure everyone wants to know what this cartridge is like so on the back here we have some really weird instructions on how to open it you have to put your two fingers in here like this apparently and slide this one up like that and then apparently you get your vape cartridge to come out and uh yeah holy they can even come out so there's our vape cartridge and this cardboard piece let's uh pop this out here i don't even know what i was saying there but we have those two rubber pieces here to protect the mouthpiece and the thread piece i kind of have it nice and zoomed up here right now but as you can see we have our thc logo and that nice blue hexo logo unfortunately there is nowhere on this cartridge that is saying there's fire og which is not a bad thing but i tend to mix up my cartridges a little bit when they're not labeled as you can see we have that nice golden distillate inside of this and i honestly can't wait to smoke on this and try it oh so i will say the stuff i was smoking on before was super sour diesel by daily special if you haven't seen that review i'll leave it in the description below and you can also check the video right here let's take this empty cartridge off let's put on this new bad boy all right so now we got our new cartridge on the pen you can see this one looks pretty cool compared to this one because we have a black tip and this one's like all clear and i've never seen one like this yet i'll bring it up a little closer so you guys can get a better look hopefully with a little close-up you're able to see what i was talking about and get a better look at everything inside the pen not that there's much to look at but you know what i'm talking about i guess the main part everyone wants to know is how does this smoke so make sure you go grab your pen you have your pipe your bong whatever you're smoking and let's try this today because we're about to give this a whip fire og by hexo let's go [Music] the smell from this fire og gives off that nice i don't even know how to describe it spicy aroma i don't i don't even know how to describe this one's like yeah it gives off that like spicy aroma like i don't know how to describe that smell and that taste is a classic fire og taste to fully review this cartridge i will definitely have to give this a 7 out of 10 not only for its price but for the flavor and the high that it gives off this fire og cartridge by hexo is definitely going to be up there on one of my top 10 favorite cartridges that i've ever tried this to me is definitely if you see it in your dispenser or even on the site i would go and pick it up shout out to hexo for a really great cartridge in my opinion definitely a really great cartridge make sure you

video thank you all for watching and stay stoned", "zGD8-mefRU0": "hey y'all trevor here with readyleaf and today we've got another retican ready 510 cartridge this time it's going to be tiva dominant with the train wreck see you guys after the intro when we get into this welcome back y'all so we're tapping into the train wreck cart here from retican so while i open this up quickly i'll rattle off a little bit information that they provided us on the box so this 510 ready cart came from retican with a thc total of 82.6 and a cbd total of 0.236 so a little bit lower on that cbd but it's got a torquey sativa hi to it this one is sativa dominant um i've got the lift co website pulled up with all the information we're gonna go through that quickly and then we'll be tapping in to start out with the fireside battery you guys so let's screw that sucker on there get it ready to go while we rattle off this info so the train rack ready 510 cartridge comes with 0.45 grams of distillate that is earthy piney and pungent with half plural notes which come from a terpene profile that includes alpha-pinene which is shared with pines and canifers rosemary and sage bear carefully which is found in black pepper's clothes and balsam and meristening which is also present in mangoes lemongrass hops and tam so the top effects that are felt when smoking this cartridge are typically focused happy calming and pain relief coming in last the top activities that it is used for are socializing watching tv listening to music and cleaning top method consumption is via the vaporizer of course and the scents are going to be pine sweet and earthy so that was the lift and co website with this train wreck ready 510 info that's all we needed now now we get to hop into the actual review side of it so we're going to start out with the fireside battery after that we go to the g pen battery after that we slap this little silly adapter looking [ __ ] on there and then we go ahead and we run it through some rigs so we've got all three of those ways to consume coming up after we get through the urban scale intro y'all i'll see on the other side when we're uh taking our first haul of this through the low tamp on the fire side see over there [Music] we got her set up temperatures down in the corner we're gonna take our first rip with this one right off the bat cheers y'all and let's see how this cart does okay let's bump it up to the mid level i definitely get more of that mango flavor there is a touch of like that pepper burn in the back of my throat but not overwhelming enough for me to really taste it but just enough for me to kind of experience that little pepper it's definitely more that mango kind of lemongrass flavors that i'm getting through on the low side but still really enjoyable you guys we've got it bumped up to the green the green the blue temp now and uh we're gonna see how it does at that level cheers okay so this one has a little bit more bite in the back of my throat it's got still that really strong lemongrass flavor it's quite an enjoyable cart so far you guys that pepper start to hit now you can you can feel that settling in in your chest and i definitely think this next rip is going to hit with a lot more intensity and it's going to have a lot more of that pepper flavor but it's not harsh it's still a really smooth vape you guys it's just got that good little thc kick to it that makes you uh makes you want to cough afterwards but we've got it cranked up to the high we're going to try it out here before we move on over into the g pen but so far this is doing pretty good you guys i mean i'm enjoying it quite a bit cheers okay guys so through that fireside vape i didn't get much of that pepper at the end like i was expecting which doesn't bother me at all i got more of that pine kind of that alpha plain mix with the mericine a little bit of that pepper on the aftertaste like sitting in the back of my throat but definitely by no means a strong overwhelming flavor on that pen which really really excites me and makes me happy because i like the the sweeter flavors versus those peppery flavors especially when it comes to the cards because these are like a little treat it's like my shadow you guys it's it's like dessert for when i'm smoking nine is what i'm going to end up giving it for the fireside battery really enjoyable nice strong flavor decent hit with it um just not something i'd scream to the hills about really enjoy but not overwhelming excitement now moving on to the g pen i'm curious to see if we're going to get more of that pepper flavor or we're going to get more of that alphapeni p9 or alpha penine and meristen kind of mix that piney or more mango flavor let's uh let's try it out because i think that's the only way we're gonna really be able to find out cheers okay so this one has a lot lighter flavor at the beginning it's more balanced of that pine and mango flavor together it's definitely not something that's screaming with flavor pushing me through um the little burn from the pepper in the back isn't isn't turning me away at all actually i'm quite i'm quite enjoying this so uh i've got it bumped up to the next level we're gonna try it out there and see how it does because i'm quite curious to see if uh this pepper taste is ever gonna rear its ugly head sometimes or you could have a little bite to it that makes it just that much more enjoyable we'll never know until we try it out so second level on the g pen let's get to it you guys cheers [Music] so i definitely got more of that peppered flavor through there but it wasn't overwhelming it was balanced very nicely with a decent pine flavor that i started to get as well as [Music] kind of that light lemongrass that kind of sweet grass taste that throughout i've been getting and i'm really enjoying and uh i definitely think this cart is one worth checking out for the flavors you guys especially through either the fire side of the g pen because unless this red one goes nasty on me this is going to do quite well and i'm pretty sure it's going to end up with another 9 out of 10 because it's it's enjoyable but it's not scream to the hills it's not that 10 yet you guys but you never know this could bump into a 10 or this could bump it right down let's try it out and find out cheers [Music] okay guys so i am gonna end up giving that a 9 out of a 10 for the taste from a g pen it definitely has that light flavor but nothing worth like it's it's not top pedestal but it's just a step below and i i'm really enjoying uh the little bit of a hangover flavor that i've got sitting on my tongue it's got more of that pine a little bit more of that lemongrass flavor that that is really really nice you guys so we've got two little rigs here we're gonna oh this one needs a little more water we're gonna bubble our way through this we're gonna do the first one with the fireside battery and then we're gonna run the other one with the g pen and i just do this because it's two a little bit different size rig so this one's almost like no water and this one's got a decent amount and then the g pen i find it's got a longer timeout rate so i can take a little bit bigger hauls on it and it just pushes a little bit more flavor through the rigs i've been finding lately but uh we're gonna start out with the little monkey boy glass art rig and the fireside battery let's try it out low medium and then we always preheat on high you guys i'll see on the other side of this on this side i'll see on the other side of this part of the review let's get to it light and sweet that one had more of that lemon and a touch of that pepper raw on the high preheat that sucker let's get to it cheers okay definitely more pepper on that last one i was not expecting that but the kind of mango lemongrass flavor that i'm getting afterwards very very enjoyable definitely a different approach than i was expecting but a very well done approach at the same time now we've got the g pen rigged up we've got the 420 rig from cannabox let's get to this you guys why wait any longer cheers and i will be back after this one talk about this rips the hat the overall oh there's still lots going this review yes let's keep crushing it cheers definitely lighter than the first strip on the other glass but sweet still it's definitely got more of that mango kind of peppery push a little bit tarter stronger tasting than that lemongrass has but second rep time guys cheers [Music] [Music] there we go really mango and lemongrass flavor that's that's different i mean i'm enjoying that but that is different okay time to get to this guys preheat it cheese hey guys so i'm going to end up giving the taste from a glass a 9 out of 10 as well it stayed relatively consistent with that strong flavor really enjoyable definitely more on that sweet lemongrass um mango more on that fruity side that i personally really enjoy and it had that touch of pepper in the back your throat that would allow you to sit back and really enjoy it but it wasn't overwhelming for how strong and potent the cough would come with it because that was the one thing i find with anything that's high beta core peda beta carefully is that it's got a huge amount of pepper and it tends to bite the back of my throat make me cough quite a bit like jack hair strains are horrible for that one but i still really enjoy smoking it and getting the benefits of that terpene it's just i usually need to be more of a joint or a little bit more of a sipping type of a smoke session versus the uh the fruitier buds that i can just smoke all day long because they just make my mouth water and this is definitely one of those so 9 out of 10 across the board for the flavor and for the high i think i mean i give it a 10 for the vape cartridges which is surprising like this is definitely the strongest component about it is the high and it's one of the biggest reasons why i'd go back and get it again because this train wreck is really nice it's got a good strong cerebral high to come and hit with it it settles right in behind your eyes it just kind of sits there gets a nice little cloud to it but it's not overall distracting like you can work through it and still enjoy it like you can do heavy work for 20 15 minutes 15 20 minutes i should say and then you need to sit back have a couple minutes to yourself and then go back into it right but when you're in and focused and going you can really do it you just need to give yourself a little break every so often and i like that i really like that because then when i want to be super focused or hyper focused when i'm golfing for example or anything that that needs that where you have the long periods of time where you don't need to be that focused where you can just kind of enjoy your day and then you get to the ball you're getting ready to line up you're looking there's your focus right and then the swing is the hyper focus and like honestly this would be a really nice cartridge to sip on while you're going through the golf course i'm finding for me uh it did hit quite heavy i found after the second rip i was starting to feel the effects uh but it didn't really get into its full effect until i was smoking through the glass and that's nice for me because i like these vaporizers to be something to build upon like this is definitely something that i like sipping a little bit on after i've smoked a couple bowls like this is to to really define the high define what type of effects i'm looking for so if i have a good uplifting energetic sativa and i put this in here this would give me the focus of that uplifting and energy right it just it kind of curves it into the pocket that i want for the effects that i want and oh oh it was on and it's just smooth hauling on it too little rips like that is just so smooth so flavorful it it really does allow you to just sit back and one curve that high personally for me is that big thing curving it to get that real optimum level effects that i'm looking for as well as taking the flavor potential from the strain and really running with it they did quite well and i'm enjoying the the taste as this train wreck cartridge has to offer and i'm definitely going to be tapping my way through that so i'm going to add up the three or four categories real quick and i'll be back with the overall yes so where you got a 37 out of 40. nice and easy add up on this one so it did incredibly well with the high and the flavors were consistently solid throughout i was very very much surprised at how well this strain ended up doing all the way through ready retican the ready cartridge you guys are just putting out consistent quality for a decent price like for under 30 you're getting almost a half a gram for a cart that is unreal you guys that's that's a wicked starting price and then you go and even the disposables are right around that 20 range as well so it's not anything like you can try it and see if you like it and i've heard really good things about their og kush that's the only one i haven't tried and we only have it in the disposable but after trying this train wreck it almost makes me want to so you never know i might might tuck one of those away and we'll do a disposable based review but we're gonna we're gonna wrap this one up you guys a 37 out of 40. it did incredibly well and i was quite impressed with uh with the outcome for this for this card you guys if you guys are not checking this out on

with red leaf and today we're gonna tap it into a little bit of a vape review I've got the collab hybrid half gram cart or the orange Hill special I'm really looking forward to tapping into this you guys and rockin it on the Jeep and cookies battery today see you guys after the intro yeah so we are tapping into the collab orange Hill special 510 1/2 gram cart I have tried this out a little bit before we got here just at the different temperatures because I was curious to see how it worked on the two batteries and watch battery would be the best one for flavors and for just overall production this cookie this Jeep has cookie cross battery definitely seems to be the best one and we'll have a full review video on the Jeep Ed's battery at some point once once I've got a little bit of time with it and I figured out if it's got any any issues but so far I've been loving it so we're reading off of the group good roots cannabis CA product info for the collab orange Hill special so the point 5 gram vape cartridges are made with 425 milligrams of THC and 4.25 milligrams of CBD per pen the flavor profile is influenced by the orange Hill special strain and lemon een is the dominant term feed collab project cannabis extracts are tested rigorously to ensure a high quality experience our vapes kitten only contain two ingredients cannabis distillate and botanical terpenes our formula is expertly prepared by leading Canadian producer dose can these high quality distillate is in a no leak cartridge system and is calibrated to work with with co.labs 510 thread rechargeable battery so the THC percentage is 85% and the CBD percentage is zero to one percent the one that I have right here is 85% and zero so you got this cookies Gpad we're gonna start off on the lowest temp and see how it tastes there and then we're gonna bump it up to the medium and high then after that I've got a couple of different rigs we're gonna try it out through here and then we're gonna give it kind of an overall rating out of 10 let's take our first little rip yes Cheers okay guys so that low temp I've been really finding with this cartridge that it has a almost kind of like orange jell-o kind of taste but it's got a sweeter flavor to it too like it's more of that sugary orange to it then it is that gelatin kind of flavor it's really enjoyable it's got almost kind of Sunny D sweetness for the orange it's it's quite enjoyable so now we've bumped it up to the green so a second level on the temperature and we'll see how it does on here y'all let's hop into this okay guys so there really wasn't much of a flavor difference between that low and medium tempo I definitely think either of them could be a good temperature to enjoy this at but that lower one might be better just because you'll get a longer lost out of this card she won't be burning as much and if they taste the same I really don't see the reason to bump the temperature up so now we've got it on the red temp we're gonna see how it hauls off of here one big thing I've been noticing is even with it upright it gets kind of clogged so it heats up and then I'm hauling on it nothing comes nothing comes then it almost like a popping sound like a bubble bursting in there and then it starts to halt which I'm personally not liking the way that it is like that but let's try it out on the highest temperature of this GPM before we take it through a couple of rig ribs cheers y'all okay guys so at that red temp it definitely had a lot harsher and tarter tasting kind of experience to it it it wasn't the same kind of orange jell-o flavor it definitely was more that orange cleaner kind of sharpness to it but I didn't mind it at all it wasn't the worst flavor but definitely wasn't a good one a good enough reason for me to go on the red temp to smoke this I'll definitely be keeping this on the low temp because that seems to be the best flavor for it all right now so we're gonna leave it on the red temp though so we're gonna run it through a couple of rigs we've got this little micro rig here for monkey-boy glass love having a purpose to smoke out of this now then we've got the 4/20 rig from hemp ER let's try so with a little bit of water filtration y'all Cheers I'm gonna drop that down to the lowest type of dry through here as well yes my first one tastes pretty good you get a little bit of that orange kind of kool-aid orange jell-o an artificial orange flavor but enough that it's enjoyable now that's tried out the low tab the Cheers okay guys so last last trip was definitely tasty it had a really strong orange kool-aid kind of flavor and I'm I'm enjoying this cart so far I enjoyed it the first couple of times I was trying it and playing with it with the battery and I've been thoroughly enjoying it with this review now we're gonna run it through the 420 canna box rig here let's see how it does here cheers y'all gonna start with the lowest tab first again very orange kool-aid here let's turn this bat off very strong orange kool-aid flavor very strong kind of synthetic orange flavor that I'm enjoying quite a bit right now you guys and it's uh it's doing the job I'm quite quite impressed with this but let's uh take it one more clip from the highest tempo here and give this an overall rating before we wrap this video up because Cheers surprisingly this one has the least amount of flavor but it's still really nice and pleasant it has a little bit of that synthetic orange more towards that soapy kind of like that industrial cleaner kind of orange but it's not that bad it's really really enjoyable and overall I'm gonna give it a 9 out of a 10 because it did very well for the flavors all the way through it's definitely something that I would consider getting again if options were limited the only the only real downside that I can think of is that sticky yes that it has to it but yeah I I enjoyed it let me know what you guys thought if you've tried it or if you have it let me know if you think you'll pick it up after this review cuz I'm gonna enjoy smoking the rest of this you guys but I'm going to drop that back down to the lowest tab well [ __ ] I might have forgotten to do the high so I have to do it after the exit part of the video but you know that's how good the highest and as well the fact that I'm stacking multiple reviews on top of each other in a day so overall this one's highs really nice you do get a nice uplift mentally but you get a very light and relaxing body stone and lock to to comfort and it's got a very good pain ease kind of feeling to it and then and then overall it's really enjoyable you guys I'm I'm quite quite happy with how this this card ends up doing overall for its high and at at the price point collab did did quite well in my opinion I'm gonna keep sucking on this and I'm gonna clip you guys back into the regular scheduled part of the video it's [ __ ] ridiculous but at least I've got it in the video for you guys Cheers joy the rest of the video there we go the blue flights are flashing we wrap this video up I really appreciate you guys sticking around this long if you made it this far please go and

we're going to be covering the uh riff 510 cartridge that just came to market we've got the jean gee with the super lemon haze there's a tiva dominant cartridge i'm really excited and curious to see how these guys look and how they taste and how they work so see on the other side of the intro we tap into this review cheers welcome back you guys so as i said in the intro we're going to be trying out the john gee and super lemon haze collaboration from riff this sucker came in with a thc total of 74.1 percent thc and less than 0.5 or 0.7 percent cbd it's packaged on the 8th of july 2020. so it is a new addition to the uh 510 catalog that's available in alberta so i'm really really excited to check this out and see how it does you guys so we're going to read off a little bit of information that's from the lift and co website before we go into the actual review guys so riff's all about creative collaboration especially when it's two sativa dominant juggernauts like john gee and super lemon haze we make an undeniably rich cannabis extract so don't let the lemony and citrus taste fool you this high potency thc extract is pure and ta true cannabis taste riff and then i'm reading all this off of the disposable webs the review for the same thing in the disposable i couldn't find it in the 510 they don't have any other information on it right now so that's gonna wrap up the uh chit chat before we actually get into the fun side of the review you guys so we're uh gonna tap into this john g and super lemon haze cart right now i'll see on the other side of the urban scale intro when i pop this card out and we take a look y'all cheers and i'll see you over there [Music] welcome back you guys another unique looking approach at these cartridges ooh that is very different so pull that out ooh really small hole for the inhalation there but it's a pretty hefty cartridge it's got the rift logo right on the bottom it's got the john gee and super lemon haze wrap around there and you know what you guys know before we even get going we are taking that thc sticker off of this cart come on there you go that's off of there and we're gonna add it to the collection right here i'll see you guys oh this one's gonna stick nice and quick i was gonna say i'll see you guys after i'm done getting this on here but it's already on there so we're at the lowest temperature on this vape let's uh try it out and see how this john g and super lemon haze cross from riff actually turns out you guys i'm uh quite excited to see how it's gonna do i'll see you guys over there i don't know why i'm saying i'll see you guys over there we're gonna start out at the lowest temp we're gonna work way up to the highest let's see how it does starting with the lowest chisholm [Music] so this is actually a metal tip i don't mind that draws isn't my biggest fan for this cart to draw but it does have a decent enough flavor that i'm really interested and excited to keep going on this you guys so let's uh try it out the medium temp and see if the draw is any better and see if it changes the flavor at all because that was a really nice and light citrus kind of flavor i was getting at that time of trip you guys cheers still really sweet really decent flavor draw again biggest downside and then i'm curious to see if it's going to make a difference between the g pen and the fire side just because of how small the intake holes are going to be and the g pens are substantially larger you guys can see there like you compare the two it is night day you can't even tell the difference with the camera on here they're that small so i've got it bumped up to the highest temperature still got that really nice sweet almost more of a lemon push with this one i'm enjoying this cart so far i'm starting to feel the effects too which is surprising i don't usually get it this early in the review but uh i'm enjoying it so far you guys so let's try it out the highest temp on this fireside before we switch on over start pulling it from the g pen cheers [Music] first thought when this went on the g pen was damn that looks sharp with the whole black g pen battery but all i've got is a blue and i don't mind that i like this blue quite a bit my last hoot was still really smooth really lemon rich flavor overall just enjoyable to smoke you guys and i i had quite a good flavor coming off of it and it did really really well but now we've got it moved over to the g pen i had the same draw issues with that battery at the highest temp as it did with the lowest so i'm hoping that the bigger ports on this g pen is going to allow for smoother pull and potentially some bigger clouds you guys but the only way we're going to find that out is by actually finding out we've got it set on the lowest temp of this g-pad let's see how fruity and flavorful this is going to be through the three taps you guys cheers definitely an easier lighter pull it allowed the um the flavors to definitely be more explosive in my mouth i've definitely got a really rich almost like a lemon jolly rancher not jolly ranchers um starburst that's that's really what i'm tasting here and i'm enjoying it quite a bit is that lemon starburst flavor and i was not expecting this sweet and rich of a flavor to come from this cart you guys so now that we've got it set on the second temperature let's see how it does there before we move on to the highest cheers i forgot to score the five side battery guys we're gonna give it an 8 out of 10. there we go it was enjoyable but the difficulty to pull through those ports key reason why i'm knocking it down two points but this g-pan there ain't no issue pulling from the ports it's it feels just like a regular vape cartridge does no different on the jeep than any of the other ones i've had but it's significantly different than the fireside battery and i haven't noticed any other cartridges giving me that big of a of an airflow issue through the fireside just just this one that we're trying right now you guys which is curious that uh it's the only one to have that issue right now or that noticeable of an issue but we're gonna move on to the highest temperature really easy to pull from really fruity and flavorful for um just enjoy it is a really mouth pleasure really enjoyable vaporizer to smoke you guys so we're gonna go ahead and try it out at the highest temp before we start ripping through some glass you guys i'm looking forward to seeing how it tastes um on this highest temp and i'm also really excited to see how it's going to do through the rigs because that always changes things up a little bit but let's try it out cheers okay biggest thing i'm going to mention not that harsh through the nerve through the nose doesn't burn quite as much as some of the other carts which is actually really surprising we've got it switched on over to the fireside battery again come on let's get you switched on over there we got it set up on the fireside battery at the lowest temperature again we go through our mad hatter rig here we are man we are all mad here absolutely 100 true and uh we run it through the three temperatures again to see what type of flavors we experience through the uh additional water filtration that comes with the rigs we've got our hemper adapter on there we're gonna put that in there and that's how we're gonna do it we preheat the last rip so that uh it's as fast as we can get it but for now let's uh try out the lowest tap and work our way up there i'll see you guys after these three reps when we have a chat about uh the glass but before we do that i'm gonna give the g pen a nine out of a ten the flavor was really good it had a nice strong explosive flavor in the end i just wished it was that strong all the way through and i'd give it the ten it's enjoyable but it wasn't exciting and that's where those tens are gonna come from so let's see if it's exciting to glass you guys but uh let's get smoking see you guys after these three hits cheers [Music] [Music] uh okay guys so that uh a pen did rip quite well through the rig it really didn't have an overly explosive flavor until we got to the second earth and third ribs and then you definitely got more of that lemon flavor the last one was where it was the strongest with that almost starburst like flavor and i i did enjoy it quite a bit um definitely it's something i'd be interested and curious in combining it with a really sweet citrusy strain to try and get that overwhelming overwhelming combo i think i've got some orange cookies left from gage and that might be might be how i celebrate any anything bigger just why not but uh yeah we've got the g pen ready to go you guys we got it on the lowest temp time to do three more rips and preheat the last one because why the [ __ ] not but uh yeah i'll see you guys after these three rips when we give the glass a score and then we wrap it up with the high and the overall but for the time medium cheers see you after these three rips uh okay guys i'm gonna give it a 10 out of a 10 for the taste from a glass it really that the last the g pen took it away it honestly reminds me of my favorite candy it's a hot like it's a hard candy it's the uh um lemon drop i absolutely love these lemon drop candies they're or not lemon drop [ __ ] i'm thinking of a plant you guys can that's the high the high is going to do incredibly well um not a lemon drop a sherbet lemon candy they're really really good hard candies i absolutely love them i would oh if i could have a bag of those i physically have to move them away from me because i'll just eat one after the other after the other after the other after the other i love that sweet and citrus blend absolutely favorite candies so i'm going to give it a 10 out of a 10 for the high as well without a doubt um this is one of the best hitting cartridges i have smoked yet just because it's got that combination of that jonky and the super lemon hey so that john gee i'm feeling is that really heavy mental drift that's kind of that's making me stutter up and make some mistakes but still it's really enjoyable and quite heavy on the effects but i can feel that super lemon haze it's like okay let's get up let's do something let's enjoy it so it's a very good out and about cartridge because you can smoke it and then oh let's go do something ooh let's go do this ooh let's go do that and while you're there you're really just enjoying it you've got that mental drift in there it overall it's really really great cartridge for during the day and i'm quite impressed with how heavy the effects are hitting and how much of a body uplift that i'm feeling with this riff um cartridge so it did it did incredibly incredibly well and with a 37 out of 40 only dropping three points on the entire review that's not bad um the fireside vape the biggest downside it had i honestly had from it was the size of the ports and that's more the battery than the cartridge however most other cartridges didn't have an issue with that so i've got to dock some points on that because the restricted airflow does make it a little bit harder to enjoy because you're hauling harder moving to the g pen it had that flavor but it didn't have the the the sherbet lemon the lemon heads whatever you want to call them but those really good candies lemon candies um they it just didn't have that pull with the vaporizer by itself but when you threw it on a rig it absolutely had it was 100 way more enjoyable and i'm really looking forward to combining it with a very citrusy tasting strain and uh enjoying it that way but for now i'm going to take one more haul off of this and then we're going to wrap this video up after uh you see the clouds you'll see my end card slide in go ahead and click on those bottom two videos because one's going to be the most recently uploaded that's going to be the most recommended for you and uh up in the corner is gonna be my logo

cartridge today we're gonna get two reviews of these off this week we've got the boost sativa from sugarleaf i'm really interested and excited to see how this uh economy valued cartridge is gonna taste she's a half grammer so uh we'll get the intro done and over with and then we'll see on the other side when we start going through the info you guys cheers and i'll see you on the other side of this intro [Music] welcome back you guys so as i said in the intro we are tapping into the boost sativa 510 cartridge from sugarleaf so this is actually their first cartridge and um they are definitely a very nice economy valued cartridge they came up right around the 35 through to 37 dollar mark if i remember correctly it did not break 40 which is great for that half a gram it came in with a thc total of 80 percent today a cbd total of 0.21 and it was packaged on the 20th of july 2020 so we've got the info on the sugar leaf cannabis website we're going to read that off quickly before we get into actually trying this vape out so the busativa is made to be sweet and discreet it's combining the extract thc distillate from the jean gee sativa dominant flower and reintroduces its cannabis terpenes so this buu sativa is going to be a john g bass drain here let's just mark that down said i make sure to write that up on the uh the youtube and we do pages for the info so we've got the tasting notes are going to be pungent sweet citrus and wood the breakdown is going to be a thc range of 76 to 82 percent so we're right on that higher mid range and a cbd content of zero to one percent and it's a 510 compart cartridge is the um method that you're going to be consuming it so that is all of the information that we have off of the sugar leaf website i'm really excited to see how this strain is going to uh put out its flavors and whether we're going to get that really strong citrus lemon flavor that i've learned to enjoy with the john g strange you guys but um that's all the info i've done enough jabbering let's uh open this cartridge and see how it does you guys we'll see on the other side when we're starting out with the fireside battery and uh sugarleaf's boost sativa cartridge [Music] cheers [Music] okay right off the bat i'm going to say package is beyond excessive you've got this huge smell proof container all of that goodies and then a little thin piece of plastic in there for it and i don't know how i feel about that piece of rubber being in there that could be a pain ooh actually it's not that bad to get out which is nice and then the rubber stopper on the end so overall the look in the cart isn't bad it's got a decent weight to it actually it's one of the heaviest carts i've experienced myself for the pickup see can we get yes we can we're going to get rid of that thc sticker right away because you don't need to know that you're getting high while you're smoking on that so there we go it's got a really good look with the fireside vape battery that silver and gold matches up really nice and uh i've been able to get these thc stickers off here so let's keep lining them up on the torch here you guys let's see how many we can get up on here let's get this one there perfect now let's try this out i've got the fireside vape set to this lowest temperature we're going to work our way through the lowest medium and then all the way up to the highest temperature before bumping on over into our g pen battery here doing the exact same thing and then we hook it up through the two batteries again and run it through some glass we've got that right here and our hamper adapter so that allows us to smoke it through the glass you guys so that's gonna break down our urban scale portion of this review i'm really really looking forward to seeing how this uh john g based boos sativa cartridge from uh sugar leaf taste you guys i haven't tried anything from sugar leaf yet so this is going to be really that first opportunity to see how they put out their product let's get to it y'all cheers and i'll see on the other side of these three ribs [Music] we're on the highest temp now you guys let's try it out okay guys so that fireside battery it definitely had that sweet citrus kind of push to it and i enjoyed it quite a bit at the same time it also had a nice light almost kind of pine based flavor too i really enjoyed it and definitely was something i was um looking forward to after the first trip for the second and the third and i'm looking forward to really seeing how this gpen battery does i'm gonna give it a nine out of a ten for the taste from the fireside battery it's got a really strong flavor but it dissipates a little bit too quick for my liking and that's why i'm only going to give it the 9 out of 10. if it held and pushed through i could easily give it a stronger um stronger rating but i can't quite do it this time so uh got the g pen pepped prepped and ready to go we're gonna take our three reps through that and then we'll see you guys on the other side when we're starting to smoke through the glass but uh for now let's get these three ribs over with i'll let you know how it did cheers hey guys got that high stamp ready to go let's see how it does through the g pen so far i've been liking the fire side more let's see what this one's at you guys see if it can pull for a win for the g pen again cheers you can give the g pen nine out of a ten as well it's on the weaker side of the nine than uh the fireside was it took until that third rip for that battery to really explode with its flavor um i did get a little bit more of a green tea type of push from the g pen than i did anything through the vape through the fireside vape i still really really enjoyed the overall experience that uh this bud gave off and the overall kind of sweet piney flavor with that light green tea with the uh the g pen it was very much enjoyable you guys but for the time being we've got there uh we're all mad here bell we're going to uh tap in with the fireside battery again we're gonna run through low medium and high temperatures with the preheat on the high see how it is through some glass move it over to the g pen exact same thing through the 420 rig and then i'll be back to let you guys know how i think it tasted through there talk about the high a little bit and then we'll wrap this sucker up but uh for the time being i hope you guys are enjoying let's uh let's get into this y'all cheers let's get to it with the g pen you guys the fireside was really sweet but i'm starting to find that green team flavor all the way through um the only way we're gonna find out if uh the g pen has it again is by uh getting it through the rig you guys let's uh light the sucker up and get going cheers see on the other side of these three reps so preheat it for the last rib y'all cheers okay yes i'm gonna give it a 9 out of 10 for the taste from a glass it was not the best connection with the um the adapter so it didn't come through quite as strong as i would hope it would but it still was quite enjoyable you guys it had a lot more of the piney notes and a little bit more of the pepper in the back but by no means was it overpowered by one of those two flavors it was a very well blended and mixed flavor the sweet kind of pine flavor and it's got when i say pine it's that mixture of the really sweet pine leaf like the the needles and a kind of um light smoky wood that you get from burning pine wood like very much a mixture of that really really really enjoyable and a good representation of the john g strain um it doesn't go on the citrus side but i'm not upset with that because it pulls the sweet from it which is something i'm i'm enjoying quite a bit and a 9 out of 10 for a taste from a glass is gonna be the best i can give it and i think if i could get fuller like really rich tasting um rips through the glass i think it would have potentially get a 10 but this doesn't quite have it now but if we move on into the high that does have enough to get a 10. it is a unreally sativa dominant cart that is true to its name and it's very heavy and high it is sitting very much behind my eyes a little bit behind my ears like at the base here and down my neck doesn't go into the body very much uh it does have a good uplift and boost kind of that that that jump to it um but you could sit back and just go off onto a mental drift if you want to you could be distracted by something quite easily if you are going to let yourself do that or if you just smoke a little bit too much of this for somebody that's a lighter smoker i could definitely suggest single puff or half puff would be a good start for a heavier user like me after all of those ribs i've got a really good bait going and i'm enjoying it quite a bit you guys but it's going to wrap it up with a 10 out of 10 out of the high we're going to get a grand total for the overall a 37 out of 40. it only lost a total of three points through the flavor and it really was just a lack of intensity i would say was the best one and just some personal pickiness within the flavor which isn't a bad thing again i don't think so at least but um 37 out of 40 is an incredible score this vape did really really well um the high was definitely the number one point for me thoroughly enjoyed it and uh i'm definitely gonna enjoy smoking the rest of this card i hope you guys enjoyed this review if you did please go and like it down below and uh let me know which card i should try out next i'm quite curious about the tangy kush from good supply and pink kush by fido both of those showed up in my local store and i'm interested in one of those if you guys have a preference out of those two let me

from co2 extracted hybrid cannabis with no flavorings or additives and comes in at 78 thc and 0.02 cbd legal cannabis extract options are becoming more and more available moving into the summer which means finding the right one can feel daunting with prices sitting on the higher end this vape cart from miley natural be a great first option it comes in minimal packaging and has a nice weighty feel when using our spinach 510 battery the draw was relatively smooth and had a little bit of an earthy and spiced taste the effects set in fully after a few minutes in total we took two three second inhales for this review the effects were not overpowering but offered an uplifting and creative hybrid high i really enjoyed using this around the campfire as there was no need to grind up more flour and load it into the bowl or joint i would recommend this vape card over others containing flavor agents so you have a more natural experience if vaping cannabis concentrate is how you are looking to consume this would be a great choice to dip your foot in the water as with anything start low and slow so you can fully appreciate this product enjoy", "m3MX29N5dw8": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome to wavy vaporizers i'm your boy early today we're going to be doing a review of the vertical it is a 510 battery from the same company that makes the pocket ones i love the pocket one these are my favorite okay one reason only it hides the complete cart okay this is a graham cart and as you can see the only thing that sticks up is the mouthpiece i live in florida legalized but you need a card and even if you have a card you can't just walk around hitting these because you know you're gonna get some piggy that's gonna lock you up okay so that's why i like the pocket one this is not usb-c it's regular usb the vertical is actually usb-c which i like that should be improvised in the second pocket one they've decided to make definitely should have usbc the pocket one three set uh wattages but the thing is it doesn't really tell you anywhere in the booklet what those wattages are but for the vertical it actually shows you and tells you what is what i'm not going to tell you what is what i'm just going to let you look at it and when you get it you'll see it but as you can see you have five different wattages that you can use personally i have it at 309 but i should lift it up matter of fact that's what i'm gonna do so in order to change uh wattages you have to press it twice consecutively twice fast and then you scroll through pressing it one time so you have different colors i just set it to the red the 354 well i'm sorry i didn't i didn't quite introduce my buddy this is waylon it's like an asian name he's my mom's dog my mom came to visit me for new year's which is amazing i haven't seen my mom in like three or four years but um yeah this is my co-host as you can see he's in his own world he's chilling best dog i've ever been around i swear i love animals i love all types of all types of animals but him he's definitely like yeah he's one of those dogs that you could be like a big bad wolf type of dude and he's gonna soften you up and make you feel like you know what i mean anyway let's hit this i got it at red cheers as you can see it shows the cart i really don't like that cool battery and another thing it doesn't really stand up you have to lay it flat i like the pocket ones they stand up the verticals and as you can see it's fine performs good feels good in the hand but if you want to have privacy as you can see it's not gonna give you that privacy the only way you're gonna have privacy is if you cover the whole thing like this cover the cart and try to hit it as you cover the car but other than that it's not really this is this is it right here ladies and gentlemen like you want 100 ultimate discretion ninja style is this i hope you guys have a happy new year tomorrow is new year i wish you guys the best and i hope the

have i love you guys say bye wayman say bye youtube bye [Music] hmm", "vPDFXw6hHeY": "hey y'all trevor here with ready leaf and today we're gonna be diving into our 510 vape cartridge i know it's christmas eve so we're gonna stay somewhat festive today i'm gonna have to go and plug in those christmas lights to uh cheer us up but for the time being we got something from tabletop we're gonna be diving into the 90s oh gee kush honestly i've been a big fan of any of these old-school style strains the 90s og kush is definitely one that has intrigued my interest you guys let's uh get into this 510 vape cartridge after i go ahead and plug in those christmas lights but for the time being cheers y'all and i'll see you on the other side of this intro [Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome back you guys and just like that we've got the room feeling just a touch more festive so as i said in the intro we are diving into table tops tabletops 510 vape cartridge the 90s oh gee kush as a person who's been a really big fan of the 90s og kush lately and the overall not the 90s og kush just the kush flavor lately um the 90s variant so the uh not 90 what is it 96 the pre pre-98 bubba kush i know i've got the seeds over here i know i know i'm not talking craziness yes the pre-98 bubba kush i just want to make sure i got the ear right the pre-98 bubba kush i am a incredible incredible massive fan like incredibly massive fan of that strain that pre-98 bubba kush honestly is the best pheno of that strain that i've come across it hits the heaviest for me the flavor is the most enjoyable and i've come across and enjoyed a lot of the og cush strains so i'm curious to see if that 90s variant is going to be more enjoyable for me just like the 98 bubba kush was but for that we have to dive to find out that you guys jesus i haven't smoked yet today and i'm already [ __ ] rambling and not having a good start to this uh this review so we're gonna go ahead and we're just gonna get into where i'm comfortable which are that uh actual portions of the review instead of that pre-ramblings that i tend to get myself into a little bit of trouble sometime because i just go on and on and on and on and that tends to happen about halfway through the review where i just go on and on and on and on but let's not do that today let's get into this review for those of you who haven't been here before and don't know what to expect you're gonna get a lot more of what the past little intro has been as well as the information that comes off of this individual package as well as the information that we have off of the ontario cannabis store we're going to use that as our base for today and then we go ahead and we rock it through our two 510 thread batteries we've got a vuber battery right here and then a g pen battery we rocked the uber first and then the g pen before we go ahead and run it through all three temperatures of these batteries again but we do it through our two glass rigs here we score the batteries individually for the cart on the initial pass and then when we go through the glass they get scored as a unit as a cohesive unit between the six rips after that we go ahead and we score it out of the high and then we finish it up with the overall the total and highest score that this cartridge is going to be able to get is 40 today and that means 10 for each portion of this scale one piece of vital equipment that i just about forgot to grab it's going to be our hemper adapter this is what we use to connect the cart to the rig but with that information powering you guys let's get into this cartridge so the 90s og kush from tabletop it came in with a thc total of eighty percent a cbd total of zero point zero three percent and a package date of october fourteenth twenty twenty so it still is a relatively new cart on the market so for those of you guys that don't know tabletop and ness and the mtl companies are all going to fall under the green organic dutchman so we did cover that rotterdam and the ripple we're going to dive into even another green organic dutchman based product right here in this tabletop 90s og kush cartridge but before we do that let's go over into the ontario cannabis store site and cover the info on here so the price that they have on the ontario cannabis store is going to be 39.95 for the half gram cartridge now about this product the 90s og kush distillate from tabletop comes in a 0.5 gram milliliter filled cartridge compatible with 510 thread batteries it is an indica dominant hybrid with high thc and notes of fuel skunk and space and spice dang flavor profile courtesy of limonene carefully and maracinine the flower has pulled through an advanced ethanol extraction process and these emission tested cartridges features a proprietary ceramic coil enhanced airflow and glass housing all table top distillates do not contain added solvents pigments fillers or waxes major bonus right 90 og kush it's got legs so huge huge benefit and already scoring major points for me ceramic core i love me the ceramic-based cores the verse original cartridges are ceramic base and so are the pure sun farms and those cartridges in my personal preference have been some of the best on the market for overall cartridge performance and um flavor coming off of it but with that information ready you guys let's crack open this container and get going with this full oh we just ripped off the pull tab so let's get this cartridge out you guys and uh see how tabletops 90 ogs kush is gonna do cheers and i'll see you on the other side of this herbage scale intro [Music] welcome back you guys looks like we're going to be able to get this thc sticker off of here and you know exactly what we're going to do with it once we do come on i know you want to come off there we go we got that sucker off we're going to add it to our growing ring of stickers on the torch i honestly don't know why i started doing this but at this point why not continue to uh to add to it as we go through each of these reviews but overall cartridge look is really nice it's got more of the tweed look and feel with that nice round mouthpiece the white to balance off the silver is really nice i do um i do miss having the band that lets you know what exactly you are smoking on but this coil does have a six port on the base versus some of the more typical four ports so you see those cotton ports just inside there this one does have six versus them a little bit more common fours that we have seen on some of the other companies so that definitely is interesting to see how this cartridge is going to function in comparison to the other ones but to start it off we've got the lowest temp on the vuber vubis battery the uber battery this one goes green blue red and then our g pen is blue green red before we finish it off at that highest temp but we've got some rips to dive into and i am quite curious to see how this 90 og kush tastes you guys so for the time being let's uh let's dive into this and start scoring this cartridge cheers and i'll see you on the other side okay so initial flavor on that that first draw really smooth very light overall flavor but it does have a nice heavy settling flavor on the exhale that complements the smoothness of the draw on this cartridge so very well the the mouthfeet mouthpiece has a really nice almost kind of grip to it so when you put it to your lips you don't feel like it's going to slide out overall a nice enjoyable experience so far for the flavor side of things i'm getting a nice light lemon hint but it definitely has more of that grassy almost kind of gassy touch to it as well the the higher the temperature goes i the feeling that i have a feeling that the higher the temperature goes the more we're going to lose on that sweet side the more we're going to lean more into that kind of gassy grassy cross but the only way we're going to find out you guys is by diving in and trying it out we've got the second temperature ready to go let's get into this and see how it does you guys cheers okay guys so let's second temperature and flavor coming off of this cartridge it was really nice you started to get a nice strong full-bodied lemon flavor and started to get little and light hints of that pepper and spice combo and it worked really well within the two and it actually developed quite intensely at the end to kind of give you a nice lemon pepper cross which was incredibly enjoyable and honestly left me quite pleased with the final extent to this if if these og kush cartridges lean towards more this lemon lemongrass citrus base you guys i am going to be loving this cartridge for the entirety of it and can't wait to dive into the flower but if she goes on that pepper trail which i have a feeling it could be on this higher temp or when the oil within that point within the actual ceramic coil it's heating every time if that starts to go a little bit peppery or a little bit rancid we could be losing some score quite quickly because it's it's one of those flavors that it either does incredibly well consistently or it starts to [ __ ] the bed when you add a little bit more flavor or you try to get it a little bit more intense you guys so let's see let's see where it goes if it goes on the good or it goes on the bad the only way we're going to find out by smoking what we have so let's go ahead crank that highest temp back and give our score for the vuber battery cheers and i'll see you there [Music] okay guys so as i switch this over to the g pen the last taste from the uber was quite disappointing i'm not gonna lie it was a little bit of a letdown in comparison to the other two you had more of a really light almost acidic pepper kind of flavor it wasn't uniquely lemon per se but more so just kind of citric in general like very citrusy leaning still it was a decent flavor nice enjoyable final kind of experience for that uber battery and it has me excited for the g pen because i see that the potential for the cartridge should put off a really intense and heavy flavor because of the larger ports and just have it be more potent i'm thinking is going to be the benefit for the g pen over the uber but saying that i'm gonna give the vuber an 8 out of a 10. it did have that much of an enjoyment and kind of uplifting flavor to it that i can enjoy and with the g pen i'm expecting the same or better honestly but the only way we get to find out about that is by smoking our way through it we've got the first rip ready to go let's dive into it and see how she does you guys cheers and i'll see you on the other side okay guys at this point that pepper is starting to become a little bit more dominant but i was right about the ease of the haul through the g pen you can get a lot bigger haul and a lot stronger of a haul through this just due to the larger ports on this battery versus our uber battery it's not a big like a big big change in the sense of the actual size but it makes a major difference when you're hauling through here it's crazy the amount of the the size difference between the g pen and the vuber and the clouds if you were to go blinker to blinker the timeout on this one is longer and the ports are bigger so you're able to get more in and that also affects the flavor because i got a lot more pepper this time with that intensity so the pepper starts to creep in a lot more when you're pulling more of the oil through as well as the lemon flavor had more that lemongrass flavor less of the lemon citrus flavor so it it changed a little bit still all in all that sweet lemon pepper cross is definitely what i enjoyed now we're gonna go ahead try it on the second temp see how it hits see how it holds for that flavor and um just enjoy it you guys cheers and i'll see you on the other side okay guys so that second rep honestly was just a weaker version of the first experience with the lemongrass flavor and that kind of sweet flavor but the pepper ring like that a little bit of that black pepper burn you get on the back your throat that stayed consistent with the um the last experience that it just seems to be building upon that so at this point we're starting to lose a little bit of that lemon flavor we're starting to almost see a little bit of the breakdown of the oil within that that uh the heating compartment of this vape and it actually is losing a little bit of its flavor which is a big downside of doing these reviews and stacking this many hoots like a uh a dozen hoots through the uh the cartridge you guys but we got the highest temp set on here it might just be that voltage maybe not agreeing with this cartridge but we've got it set on the highest let's see if we get a more intense more enjoyable flavor before we move on into the rigs because there we pack six hoots in boom boom boom boom boom boom let's get these these uh the first half a dozen rips done and over with and the g pen a score out of 10 you guys cheers and i'll see you on the other side okay guys so the g pen is going to end up getting a 7 out of 10. and it did the same thing that the uber did but the difference is that the vuber did it on the way up so the flavor increased with every rip and it got more enjoyable more intense and it just it left you with kind of an almost endless expectation at the end where the g pen had just started to degrade it started to break down every hoot got a little bit harsher a little bit more a little less enjoyable each time and that's really why the g pen is gonna get a point less is because it just it leaves at the end of the session if you're feeling uplifted enjoyable like you're going off feeling better about your day there's extra points to be earned but if it kind of leaves you going what the [ __ ] you're gonna lose a couple points so that's the difference between the 897 with the vuber and the g pen but now now we get to dive in the glass and just rip both apart because this is either gonna do incredibly well and we see improvements and nice intense flavor or it just shits the bad so let's see uh whether we're gonna get a a warm feeling in our hearts or a warm feeling around our thighs you guys dive in and find out cheers say get ripped folks you know how it goes down we preheat on that third cheers okay guys so through the uber egg it had still that nice strong intense lemon flavor the really citrus output overall and it's just i don't know why the g pen can't do that is the larger port is the fact that it's just a different voltage match up with the cartridge i do not know but that uber battery is slowly starting to become my personal favorite for uh a lot of these new carts that are coming out and that's that was not something i was expecting you guys but we got the g pen she's still a nice good old girl we're gonna run her through the three reps on 420 rig because uh it's about that time guys so let's see how she holds up and how she hits through the glass with the jeep head but so far the uber's doing quite well really really well blended lemongrass lemon pepper cross but for the time being let's uh start ripping some bowls cheers okay guys we are on that last rip let's go ahead preheat the [ __ ] and dive into it cheers okay guys so the glass is gonna end up getting a seven out of a ten for its score i'm i'm just gonna tell you right now we uh we aren't going to be using the g pen for this cartridge anymore that that smurf blue looking thing was the reason for that seven out of the uh out of the out of the glass the uber in this cart the fact that the silver and silver match up all sexy and like i think these two are meant for each other because this cartridge is absolutely delicious through this pen and i cannot get enough of it especially that lowest hemp even on the medium we get that nice calm overwhelming kind of blend of that pepper and the lemongrass kind of cross i'm it's surprising that i don't get much of a kind of a kush experience from this but it's more kind of that lemongrass and pepper cross it leans me more towards the white lemon from thumbs up kind of an experience and honestly a strain that i am so excited to try and flower the the flavor that this cartridge puts off has some major potential for just a really nice and enjoyable smoke through the flower if it has this lemon and pepper blend of flavors but with that being said we're going to move on to the high which is going to be a 7 out of 10. and i'm going to be honest with you guys this is just an amazing high that's too weak for me to score well that's honestly the best way i can describe this it's a really nice and heavy mood enhancer but it doesn't have that extra little for me to get that like that big goofy smiling joking around kind of feel for an indica this is definitely more uplifting more okay let's get up and do [ __ ] kind of a smoke for me it is a massive improvement for mood and for just overall um more the mental kind of i just don't want to do [ __ ] um when it comes to the body doesn't even touch it like it is a 100 cerebral type of strain i'm finding with the vape which isn't a bad thing it's that perfect combination of having a nice heavy body stone from flour and then adding this to top it off and a 7 out of 10 is really going to be there because i want more i just want more of this i want more of everything that it has to offer and i want to experience what type of body high it has and i have a feeling that the flower is going to provide that type of experience for us and it's definitely one we'll be diving into next month i have it set aside i'm really really interested in trying it but it will be a january-based flower and if you guys want to go and vote the mr writer leave page is the place to go and vote because well instagram shut down the main page for the time being so we are going to try and grow up the the backup page and grow page a little bit more as well as uh i've hopped on cannabis you guys if you want to check me out there but for the time being you guys this strain overall did quite well a 29 out of 40 for its final score it really only lacked the intensity of the flavor through the g pen when it came to the actual cart in and of itself so the honey sticks the elf sticks or any of the ones you find in your vape kit boxes i have a feeling will match up with this cartridge really well just because they are the little bit of the smaller ports now i can't speak on the voltage side which ones are going to work best the g pen's biggest downside i've i'm feeling is the ports because of the intensity of that flavor like i said it's either going to complement it or it's going to [ __ ] it over it [ __ ] it over so that's the biggest grief i have is there is too much with the g pen it needed to be throttled back just a hair but 7 out of 10 still really enjoyable i and honestly through the g pen i would still sit down and smoke it it's just more sips versus hauls on the uber so 20 7 out of 10 for the high 29 out of 40 for the overall it did quite well and tabletop you've impressed me and ceramic coils thank you so all

cake 180 review folks this sucker might have just broken 30 percent have to wait and see you tomorrow cheers [Music] you", "zCNt5E-XM5s": "today we got disposables we got the vapor lock the voice pretty we're gonna slice her open what's up everybody and welcome back to my channel my name is from duck and thank you for tuning in on this beautiful date today we got disposables we got the vapor locks 1500 puff device and we're going to compare that bad boy to the pop extra device vape disposable device and we're going to see who wins in this ultimate battle but before i unbox the sexy vape if you want more vape reviews vaping boxes and to stay up to date to the latest vape information subscribe down below and hit that bell notification icon for the latest updates on my videos all right let's unbox the vapor locks device i did do a vapor locks review it was the smaller one and this one is revamped redone and re everything it's really really cool i can't wait to see oh yeah [Music] look at the package on this bad boy it looks really really pretty we're gonna slice her open the smell the smell smells like pineapple peach and mangoes which is the flavor of this device it smells so good look at that up close i'm really really liking this device pop off the silicone baby and there it is there is device the airflow is at the bottom and the led and the care will also be at the bottom all right here they are side by side very similar in size and thickness mouthpieces are similar as well you can see there is a little bit curve the pop extra which is okay led indicators are at the bottom which is great which one is better specs wise so the vapor locks has 1500 puffs that is freaking unbelievable the pop extra has 1200 puffs which is still really really good for a disposable device the vapor lax has a 6.5 milliliter pod the pop extra has a 3.5 millimeter pod which is kind of weird how do they do that like how is there much more juice in here and much more puffs but such little juice but a lot of puffs in this not sure how that works maybe you could answer that for me they are both five percent nick which is amazing that is so so crazy and the vape relax has a thousand milliamp battery this thing is not going to die on you i promise you that so you get all the juice out by the time this dies and this has a 650 milliamp battery the pop extra that is really interesting as well so the vapor locks looks like it's kind of winning in this battle but you do have to admit the pop extra designs on the device are pretty nice pretty pretty little like fruits and stuff on there which is cool but the only way to test out these bad boys is to test out the clouds and flavor of these sexy vapes so we're gonna try out the vape relax first and see how good the clouds and flavor of this peach pineapple mango device is look at the clouds and the flavor you ever go get some boba or bubble tea and you get like a peach mango slush this is literally that in a vape and i'm just gonna i'm just gonna eat it oh oh it's so good the flavor is absolutely amazing all right let's test out the clouds and flavor of the pop extra flavor here is strawberry lemonade oh clouds of flavor are great too it tastes so good um i'm on a beach right now drinking that strawberry lemonade i'm gonna eat this too they're both such great devices i absolutely love them aprilx does have a smoother pull and from what i am told you can adjust the airflow at the bottom for the device which is cool and a great feature every disposable should have but what's a vapor view without maxing this baby oh we're gonna max out the vape relax right now and see how good this device really is smacks out the vapor locks right now oh the vapor locks definitely wins in this battle it is such a great device holy geez i'm so impressed with it everything is better but definitely beats the pop extra in this battle please be of age and please be responsible if you do purchase these devices i do not promote underage vaping my ladies and gentlemen thank you everybody for tuning into this week's video thank you to my new viewers and subscribers for tuning in once again as well

here's Riley and today we've got our Thursday vape cartridge review so today we're gonna be tapping into one of Redick hands ready cartridges these 510 cards here we've got the skittles in the good one we can't wait we can't wait I can't wait to dive in and I hope you guys can't wait either we're gonna crack it open this package once we're on the other side of that intro see you guys over there Hale so I hope you guys enjoyed the way through that kind of hiccuping intro so like I said we've got the skittles 510 kart from Redick on this sucker came in at 23 $24 I believe like it was here let me get the receipt for ya so this Redick can before tax is $27.99 sorry about that $27.99 you guys before tax that's pretty good for almost just shy of a half gram card so before we tap into this I've got the lifting Co website pulled up with the skittles 510 vape cartridge info we're gonna rattle those off quickly before we go into the actual review for this you guys and we do have a little bit of a change up for the review system and I hope you guys enjoyed that but let's get this information off so we can actually get into that so the skittles 510 vape cartridge is a hybrid distillate with an indicator peon profile with sweet berry herbal tropical notes packed into a cartridge containing a total of 0.45 grams 0.45 milliliters of distillate this cartridge is only compatible with 510 thread batteries we use cannabis extracts and terpenes for our ingredients freedom of any non cannabis cutting agent so the top four effects that are felt when smoking this are happy calming appetite enhancing and pain relief the four activities that are used for when can zooming this are listening to music watching TV socializing and working the top method of consumption is via the vaporizer it's the only way of consumption and the scents are going to be citrus sweet and pine so I'm definitely interested in trying this out and tapping into it you guys let's do it let's get on over into the urban scale side of this and try it out [Music] welcome you guys so ooh here we go we've got actually we've got ourselves a little instruction card that came with this that just let out when we open that up let's pull the card out and see if there's anything else that comes with this nope no strain in for anything too bad so here we go you've got user instructions for the cartridge it breaks it down it gives you some troubleshooting - and some cautions as well not to expose your card to certain things and then it gives you some vaping tips so let's rattle off the baking tips before we actually try this out you guys start low and go slow everyone has a different tolerance it may take a few tries to find the perfect amount for you take one or two draws from your vape pen and wait twenty to thirty minutes may take time to notice the full effect to your products use responsibly never operate a motor vehicle while impaired green tank made on the bottom there we go guys that's a little bit of info that gave us now we've got this card here so you guys can see that nice Redick add logo there and how clean appears card is actually got kind of a goal you to it which is interesting it's definitely one of the lightest colors that I've seen for the cart the actual card itself is actually nice simple bill nothing fancy but it it definitely is nice to see you when the carts look full but you can see there's the air bubble in there but they look full still so we got let's bump that down to the low temp we're gonna start out with the fireside battery here so we've got three different temperature settings on here you'll see them in the corner we're gonna run our way through here and I'll tell you guys what I think after that and then we're gonna bump it over to the G pen and then after that we're gonna take it through rip through a couple of rigs and I'm gonna give it a score out of ten for each of these batteries and the rig separately and we're gonna have an overall score of 30 now we're gonna get this a little bit more into a rain version because we are doing cart a little bit more regularly so let's try out this Redick and skittles card for the first time I'm really excited just to give you guys a little bit information on the actual best card itself came in with a THC point of of 88 25% a CBD total of point two zero five percent less than like just shy of a fifth of a percent and it was packaged on May 5th 2020 so with all that information rattle off I can't wait to start smokin and let's start smoking you guys let's try this card out and see how it does Cheers okay so that low temp actually really really reminded me of the blue dream cart from good supply that really fruity herbally sweet mix is awesome I was not expecting that flavor at all from this if it that's the type of flavor that's gonna push through through here it's gonna do quite well because I do really enjoy that blue dream the blue dream cart from good supply that's very very close to the flavor that I'm getting with this so let's see if we still get that fruity herbally sweet flavor when we bump it up to the medium temperature you guys we're on that blue light let's try it out Cheers okay so that time I definitely got a little bit more of like a tropical acidic bite to it it definitely was not something I was expecting at all especially after that blue dream kind of berry sweet herbal flavor it's I don't know what's going on with this baby you guys but I'm I'm enjoying it quite a bit you've got a bump up to the red I'm really interested to see what's type of flavors you're gonna get pushing through this cart when you crank it up to the highest and half take it sip through it but the only way we're gonna find out is I'm if we actually do it and at that point you guys where I think we should actually do it try it out see how it tastes say yes I'm gonna give it a 9 out of 10 that really unique flavor through all three because when you cranked it up to the highest temp the scart definitely had a lot more of that citric tropical kind of flavor pushed through it and it was really really enjoyable and definitely not again not something I was completely expecting it threw me off a little bit with every flavor having its own unique flavor and I did enjoy it quite a bit we're gonna give it a 9 out of a 10 because of that we're not gonna give it a 10 because I as much as I love every unique flavor I would rather just pick a flavor and do exceptionally well at that and this one did really well in all three flavors with that more blue dream kind of berry herbal flavor at the lower temp that mild and cross between that and it kind of like a pineapple Express from good supply that nice gentle mix is a berry the herbal and the tropical kind of flavors and then the tropical push at the higher temp they were all really good but they weren't at all of the line and that's where those tens are gonna be coming from or taking flavor me just run with it it didn't quite do it for me this time but we've got the G pen set up let's see if a little bit of a fancier battery will give us the flavors for that and get it a but only way we're gonna know is if we start out so we've got on the blue temperature on the G pen for the first level then we bump up to the green and the red finally at the end let's try it out you guys Cheers nice really mild not overwhelming but nice strong flavor it is definitely more along that blue dream side but with the Jeep and I'm getting a lot more of that tropical push so it's more of like it's got kind of a pineapple touch to it that berry pineapple mix I'm I'm enjoying it quite a bit and now that we've got it set on the second tab the second highest tab I'm curious to see if we're gonna get a more of an explosion of that tropical flavors like we did through the fireside babe and I really can only try that out if we actually try it out you guys I'm I'm enjoying this car quite a bit right now all the skittles from reddit can do and quite well happen to it - Cheers you guys [Music] okay guys so it definitely got a lot more of that tropical push that time through the vape it's I don't know how to describe it this is really kind of on its own unique flavor and I'm enjoying it quite a bit you guys that blend of the Blue Dream berry herbal flavor and kind of a Marley gold almost tropical flavor I'm really very much enjoying this cartridge gut set the high step now we're gonna see how it does through here I'm really curious we're gonna get that strong pineapple tropical flavor you guys so let's try it out and see how it does Cheers you guys so I'm gonna give it a 9 out of a tenth of the GFN it was really nice and flavorful and that last one it ended up going really perfectly me which I didn't expect there went more that kind of blue dream perfume kind of flavor went really acidic almost it wasn't a bad flavor just was not something I was expecting and I definitely didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of the flavor so that's really where I'm gonna be knocking that point on there's really good flavor of just not what I wanted so we've got it screwed back into the fireside battery we're gonna take three different temp through the rig try it out through here and cup little hauls up back over to the Jeep and take it through another rig see how it does through there and after that I'll give you guys a score on the state pintura ring see you guys on the other side Cheers [Music] [Music] okay yes we got the G pen and the mini rig ready go try it out and we will be preheating that last rift like we normally do Cheers [Music] yes yes so gonna end up getting that nine out of a ten to the taste from irate it again really well for those first two flavors took control that blue dream flavor and ran with it it was doing really well and then it ended up going to more of that perfumey flavor at the higher temp on both of the Pens this time and it was it's not that it's not enjoyable it's just not my preferred flavor and it's it's a preference neg it's a personal preference although I it's not getting attend honestly there but it did have a really strong blue dream very herbal super sweet kind of flavor at that that ability to go and who kind of a perfumey flavor that wasn't as enjoyable but we did forget to mention one other part of this that's the high highs gonna get eight ten out of a tentative score you guys it is a really nice strong hitting cerebral eye for an indica nice and relaxing nice and easing definitely has a huge benefit for like anxiety or any sort of like panic uptight you need an ease I find this is really well and hitting that kind of relaxation support there and it's not something that I needed a lot of to start feeling it the more I smoke the more it just kind of mellows everything out that's really nice that way where you can get a nice light effect or a heavier effect depending on how much you want to sip on this and there is a mild body hi I'm not feeling it very strongly like it's got a light relief but definitely is not a huge pain reliever it's too bad on that side I wish it would be a little bit stronger there but it has enough of a mental distracting that you're not worried about it that way where the mild pain relief is enough to to have you would really enjoy the high and I would just use a different strain for that heavy pain relief if you need that much that legitimate pain will be there but that's gonna wrap it up because I'm gonna have it over all of 37 out of 40 which is incredible this card did really really well but for the price point of under $30 that's not too shabby for just shy of a half gram card and 82% gate sheath the really good flavor purple melon but really good flavors really good concentrate overall and I just I'm quite happy with this purchase you guys in this product overall I'm really looking forward to trying out the train wreck the one

pineapple yeah I do like the the reduced Carlton to reduce pineapple flavor gym it does have a hint of something I don't like that I can't put my finger on I mean it's not like a deal breaker or anything but I'm gonna go with it for vm i'll give it a four that whatever that off I mean it's not you know off the taste flavor but there's there's an undertone that I can't put my finger on so I

review for you today still another review but something a little different uh make sure you like comment subscribe all that stuff as usual and uh i just updated the ranking system for the previous videos got some more videos coming up in the next week or two and have a huge sweet christmas stash that's going to be uh ordered here in the next week i'm so going to be doing a whole bunch of videos over christmas holidays which i'm pretty excited about so uh today we're gonna do a couple 510 cartridge reviews um so i've got the daily special og kush and the daily special uh super sour diesel so got both of these at the same time on the ocs obviously and uh i have to admit not bad i really enjoyed smoking them and the convenience of the carts themselves um i found for me personally with these two carts um that was probably two or three four pulls that got me to a good sweet spot of being high um the taste i found on the og kush to be a little bit better than the super sour diesel did not have a real chemical taste which was nice um i know these aren't the live resin um aren't you know the full spectrum they're the distillate but still i enjoyed them not bad didn't clog at all used the super sour diesel pretty much all up and looks like it's a pretty clean chamber not much residue left there were no air bubbles even after the cartridge has been used it's pretty clean um yeah i know i'm pretty excited about it um same with the og kush looks like i'm pretty much three quarters of the way through and uh yeah same thing overall seems to be a pretty good cartridge for the price i would love to try some of the um full spectrum the live resin all those type of things heard really good stuff about the gray beard but also heard a couple complaints that it was clogging um what was the other one the white rhino island honey the pure the full spectrum from pure sun farm i would like to try those two just as a comparison but i find with these ones anyways with the distillate that it doesn't get me as high as the actual flower more of a short term intense head high opposed to a longer term full body high on a flower and by full body i don't mean you know a body high but more of like a full i guess for lack of better word full spect from high i don't know it's different i find anyways maybe other people feel differently but i find with the distillate it's more of a intense head high rush um also want to try the new bingo carts out there i suspect they're probably pretty similar to the daily special um but yeah so not bad so i've got none left of the super sour diesel oh like i said probably a quarter left of the og kush so why don't we try a little bit here just so you guys can see firsthand what it's like and uh obviously you can't put these ones under the microscope but you guys can at least get the uh the taste and um overall experience with this card itself so let's give it a shot and see [Music] laughs i find it like a little bit more harsh too with the um with the carts that's a nice taste doesn't taste too chemically which is good um like i said it's got some decent it's almost skunky sort of but i like it and for the discreteness discreetness and convenience i'll probably buy these you know as a uh a little traveling kit although we're not traveling much anymore um but maybe you know just for something throughout the day where you want to quit something quick nice and easy but you know i i would suggest if you enjoy cards something cheap these were good i would probably buy them again um let's give another shot and see [Music] [Music] excuse me [Music] blew a cloud on that one boys and girls um thc percent i think they came in at around 80 which is pretty good um i wonder though [Music] you know what's the other 20 obviously it's to distill it but like what's the percentage of to distill it that is probably not the best for you should we say i wouldn't say you know uh toxic but you know 80 thc what's the other 20 i don't know

get started we shared links to my videos on your social media sites and please subscribe I'm working with red heart hombre really love this yarn is very soft and it's very cotton like it doesn't feel like a croelick at all this color is so pretty and it's called scuba and I'm going to start with 20 and I'm making newborn to three months in the second stitch from the hook single crochet double crochet in the next stitch to make a single crochet insert the hook through the stitch pick up the yarn and pull it through pick up the yarn and pull it through two to make a double crochet yarn over the hook first then insert into the stitch pick up the yarn and pull it through pick up the yarn pull it through to pick up the yarn pull it through - so I'm going to work across the row making a single crochet and then a double crochet and that is called the pebbled stitch so I'm gonna go ahead and work across the row okay worked across the row and I ended with a double crochet so I would turn my work under start with a single crochet because the pebble stitches worked by working the opposite stitch in the stitch of the previous row so this was a double crochet and now I'm going to make a single crochet and so this was a single crochet so it's going to be a double crochet and so that's single crochet double crochet and we're going to work across the row doing that alternating single crochet and double crochet I'm going to go ahead and work across the row okay I worked across the row and again I ended with a double crochet so I'm going to turn my work I'm gonna chain one and I'm going to single crochet in that first stitch double crochet in the next single crochet double single so I'm going to work across the row and then I'm going to work until I have approximately four inches okay I've worked a number of rows and this will be the bodice so now I'm going to start the skirt section I'm going to slip stitch in that first stitch I'm going to chain three and I'm going to double crochet in the same stitch now that's going to take the place at the first V stitch the chain three takes the place of a double crochet and a chain one space and then the other double crochet it's the other side of the V stitch now when each one of these stitches across the row I am going to make a V stitch which is one double crochet chain one double crochet so all the way across the row in each stitch of each stitch double crochet chain one double crochet like that so I'm going to go ahead and do that all the way across the room okay worked all the way across the row and I made a V stitch in each stitch across the row I'm going to turn my work and I'm going to slip stitch into that very first V stitch so in here going to slip stitch and then I'm going to chain three one two three takes the place of the first double crochet and a chain one double crochet in the same stitch working in the chain one space I'm going to make a V stitch double crochet chain one double crochet so in the chain one space of each V stitch make a V stitch I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to work this row and I'm also going to work a number of rows for the skirt and then I'll come back and show you how to do the bottom shell and the straps okay I've gone ahead and I've worked eleven rows of making a V stitch in a V stitch and you're going to make two of these and then you're going to attach them together down the side don't attach them here just start here and sew down the two sides and after you have your two sides sewn together then you can work the bottom shell so to work the bottom she'll actually arm in any one of these fie stitches and then chain two and make two double crochet in that same V stitch and then single crochet in the space between the V stitches so there's one V stitch there's the other V stitch here's the space in between single crochet in between so go to the next chain one space of the V stitch make three double crochet one two and three and then single crochet in the space between the V stitches like that you work all the way around the bottom of the skirt there's someone you have worked all the way around doing this shell on the bottom then you'll go ahead and add the straps and I'm going to start working on each side and go and work in and I'm going to make the straps long enough that they will wrap over the shoulder and attach to the back of the dress to make the trap I've attached my yarn at the side of the top of the bodice and I've chained one and going to single crochet in the next five stitches like that five stitches now I'm going to chain one and turn and I'm going to single crochet in each one of those stitches for the strap and then I'm going to continue to do that until the straps are both O two and a half to three inches long okay I've gone ahead and worked the strap and I made it approximately three inches long and now you can wrap this over to the back and you can either slip stitch to join or fasten off and sew it on the darning needle so now I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to work the other strap and then I'll come back and show you the finished dress and here's the finished dress like both of my straps finished and attached and so now you could leave it just like this or you can attach a bow or maybe even a crocheted flower I hope you enjoyed this video thanks for watching bye for now",

down you", "w5mAUXNySfY": "hi guys today we'll be working on this matte black and glossy blue striped design and after doing three different kinds of nail art stickers and all the work that comes with making your own decals I really wanted to do something simple and easy and this manicure is literally only three steps so if you'd like to see how I did it just stay tuned step one is to apply your base coat I'm using ready for takeoff and of course you can use whichever base coat is your favorite step two is to apply your base color and I'm going to be using Orly matte vinyl if you don't have a matte black you could certainly go ahead and use a regular matte or a regular black I mean and then go ahead and apply a matte top coat and I'm trying to be very mindful with the application here because if you're careful this particular polish can definitely get away with just one coat which makes this manicure even easier step three is the hardest but that's relatively speaking it's still very very easy I'm going to be using a fan brush and if you don't have a fan brush you could certainly just go ahead and use the brush right out of the bottle but to get the bristles to separate a little more what I'm going to do is to just wet it a little bit and then kind of spread them apart so that they get spiky so there you can see just kind of mess with it till it's how you'd like it then I've got a scrap piece of paper and for my stripes I'm going to be using the ZOA Kotori so get this open and I'm just going to dab some out on the paper here to dip my brush in and then you can use the brush or use the paper to practice on as well so just dip the very tips of the brush in there and then just practice a little swipe nothing complicated just little straight lines and once you're comfortable with that can go ahead and move on to your nails and I'm gonna be doing this at an angle like that so it doesn't have to be super even a little bit of randomness will kind of add to the look I think and yeah simple as that go ahead and finish off the rest of my nails and then I'll show you guys where I got the inspiration for this look so here's the finished manicure and you guys know I'm both a nitpicker and perfectionist but I'm like 99% happy with how these turned out my inspiration was actually a pair of shoes that I saw at DSW and I'll include a little picture but basically they're like a faux suede and then they had this metallic blue kind of stripy on top of that and I mean just kind of was obvious to me that that was intended to be nail art and I started out testing just doing like a dry brush technique which I'm not sure this is a very dark how well this will show up on camera but I tested out six different colors on top of the matte black and then kind of top coated half of them because realistically speaking I will eventually put a topcoat on this I'm just not a fan of matte on my nails for too long and the dry brush was okay but as far as really matching my inspiration I didn't think it was quite right so I moved on to the fan brush and gave that a try with my two favorite colors this is the one that I actually used and this one here was a very close second this was a colors by a row blue holo so I'd love to hear what you guys think of this design and if you'd like to see the glossy version I probably will post a picture of that over on my Instagram if you don't follow me on Instagram there's a link to that along with lots other useful little links down in the information box and yeah as always thanks for watching you", "RhKKDEIhfk0": "beeps today we're going to be taking a look at some juices from dr. frost now we've got Ranger Joe she's different they produces but today were going to be focusing on the little frost range which consists at the moment of honeydew blacken and strawberry ace so without any further ado let's pop the cap oh okay so these are 25 ml bottles alright there's your nicotine you can buy them over at bohemian vibe city.com and 100 ml bottles your next shorts are a pound so why don't you wanna check them out now guys just before you do that I want you to remember that effuse use offer called fat man 5 and capitals you'll get five percent off your order alright so or fire than here some of the strawberry ace from dr. frost now I'm actually using my new dog Paul and I'm using my art corn version two from calling Jesus for this currently using this right now for awhile so I can build up my final thoughts and stuff to do the full review so keep posting for that okay Robbie ace Wow whoa holy [ __ ] ah wow that is a nice juice the strawberry flavored without juice is a Maine's case of trade strawberry age before me different places and I'll be honest for them what kind of gas or gas or whatever term you want to use if you're freaky it was passion but I mean that is late and it's not totally AC you know something that especially Zeus chooses if you watch that review with the LH range oh yeah yeah that really took your brie for you but that is a nice mix actually it's not overpowering and the sense there hmm you can't breathe but it's not there's no really AC it's a nice nice V it's not one snakes and cool it really is good and the flavor for the strawberry it's just a Minsk I am really digging this oh [Music] and it makes some awesome cloaks so let me have a look at this bottle and let me tell you some information about it okay so it's a simply ferry VG PG ratio alright that's pretty much it so I mean I'm not gonna go through all the other shade that's on the back of the bottle guys he's just telling you a semi which we all can i really know is VG PG and some flavorings I don't use it and you know what the faces are not made for the electronic cigarette it's just not so for those of under 18 it's not to be used by pregnant women for a planet he breastfeed eccentric eccentric so well I'm not being funny bears no you know me to smoke when you're breastfeeding either or smoke in general when you're pregnant they do it so I mean harm reduction folks anyway I'm thinking that flavor clouds hey guys that was strawberry ace from dr. frost the little flash range so moving on we're gonna go Rianne it to honeydew black currant again this is suddenly fair I blamed guys see you again this is 25 ml sample bottles I've got three courtesy of bohemian vibe city.com they do stock it and if you head on over there it's available in 100 mils I only seen the 25 mils on the website but they may be there I've not seen them though and remember guys these are short for balls so you will need to purchase your own Nick shots and mix it yourself okay so this is how did you black its reflection now give it that it really is refreshing and I can taste the black on and I can teach the honeydew I'm just not fine to be honest after cake it's not my top ten however that being said flavor profile guys are spot-on as you can taste the honeydew block on si si it's refreshing so that being said it's probably worth a fuel any of those flavors it's a good juice personally don't like it so guys aim we have some other ones to go through but we'll do that Mississippi for the young buddy go change the court and etc so we've got the candy cane juice ease and then we've got a couple of random ones here we've got dr. of a frost remedy and shake blue raspberry milkshake so we'll go we'll get the wet changed we'll come back and we'll do the other ones alright and remember folks that's the people switch to vapor oh and before you go guys but do me a favor cuz I love you guys and I'd love you guys to love me so if he's loved me just show me o me but I love and hit the subscribe button right here Bob Bob along and had the subscribe done and had them you bail because then you'll get an email and stuff when I've posted up all right play some clothes and I'll leave you to those do day [Music]", "T5j2boGqvVg": "hello and welcome to tea and ot PR and today we're looking at own brownie liquids and weight to the we'll find out who's the winner of the vapor s Oh extra [Music] okay so today we are looking at own brew a liquid and before we get into it and start tasting and let's dive down and see what we've actually got and see if we got to do anything to make the nicotine stuff for that and then they become up and we give them a taste test okay so this slice turned up for me from home brew take these are so yeah okay so we've got a few salts a few from a different range okay and as always this is known as review and these were sent to me full of purpose was this review and she asked me what flavors are like so I spent time going through their catalog and picked out the ones on lights and it seems they foam that have a window and just sent me what they wanted because a definite didn't put mango down and I didn't even put peach down or punch it at pineapple and not peach and yeah okay I'm so here let's see what they wanted anyway is wasted time and but let's see what their she did since oh there's fast sauce go we've got a strawberry choo rhubarb custard mr. white and I'm assuming this is some kind of play on Heisenberg mr. white I'm assuming okay so you got three little suits there and then we've got a couple from their different ranges by looks of it so you've got this range which is their badass blends and then this is there ice blends nor massive fan of the ices and then these are their Gillian innocent ranges I think it's for all together but they've said neither Oh white chocolate cranberry pistachio and mango been on an apricot all different winner of ours for that one and and then I was a year we've got this icy punchy pineapple and ice mango probably would have asked for them once and lastly from their badass blends we've got the black freaky fruits and tangy twizzler okay it sounds a bit liquorice you that one that way here fruits and that sounds like one of the Arsenal is the twister isalways hmm it could be interesting okay so let's add Lamas around I shall fill these ones up and with nicotine and everything and then we come up and we give them all of Troy so let me speed up rather than boyo okay so we backup me out and yeah there you go that's what they've sent me and as I said below and yeah they asked me to pick out the ones I liked things like that and then they've sent me what just seems to be an absolute random lot and because it's all there's a few flavors in there that I'm not going to like quite simply and so a bit strange but never mind and as always I should be testing them on my vanity vegan model with my GU no delay on top sound build have done from the very very beginning to try and get that consistency going and it's basically six stainless steel core on a 3.5 mm rod real simple bill but as I say it was there from the beginning and is the server's kind of baseline let's not mess around anyway let's get on with it and let's try something easy so we're gonna start with these salt one shall we and it's topped with strawberry chew now I'm assuming this is gonna be some kind of chew it like a chewy chewy type thing and let's have a look cuz they do it and that's something ton of e-liquid so let's start here okay okay you have to give them their actual website just links you to another site to actually acquire them uh-huh and there we go so you're looking for the big ones you look in 50 mil you looking at $12.99 for one of these top ones and the salts did you do how much do you reckon these salts are okay doesn't tell you that bear with me I shall find out should've done this first original there we go 50/50 50/50 VG PG free for 995 or five for 1495 so you're looking at around free and off quick so they're not on the cheap side that's for sure they're definitely on the higher side which I don't mind spending the money if it is worth it and but let's find out there so strawberry qu e liquid year free 99 on its own so four quid for just ten mil if you have on his own so yeah it's a strawberry taffy with a slight tingle and fears of a dazzle your take bugs okay sounds interesting let's load it up and see how spice yeah smells smells like a strawberry chew it type thing like a taffy as they call it in America I think we would call it more like a starburst or if you're out like me and opal fruit fact I was talking the kids over there by then it's all local fruits they didn't know what the hell I was all about getting old anyway yeah smells nice so most of it it does feel nice so let's give it a go no nicotine all these ones actually before I get into it too much these are 12 milligram okay Tim your bottle free 99 on its own not cheap so it's giving [Applause] turn it down a little bit as it's a nick salt obviously nick salts you can make more anything but really they're made for pods you know smaller hit more nicotine type thing but you can obviously fake them on pods like this and we've gone for this before on the channel but you do want to bring that votes down a bit you start whacking away at a hundred watts things that you're gonna get a headache in no time and but yeah tastes exactly like a short BQ it um pretty one-dimensional oh it's just strawberry cherry not sure about this tingle or fees it's just pretty much like a strawberry chew it um what do they say on brew to the little Nick's always deliver nicotine more rapidly and effectively when vaping Nick salts resemble the way nicotine occurs naturally in tobacco leaf more closely okay so I'll see if you don't know the pros and cons of salts then go check out one of my other videos in fact I'm gonna do a new video on Nick's also it's still a bit of confusing with that really and some people still don't seem to quite understand it 100% so maybe there's no con look into but this is about the flavor not so much the actual salts so yeah it takes fairly decent as always off to do my little scoring thing that I always do and I probably give you a seven it's a it's a decent strawberry juice or flavor tastes pretty much as you'd expect and a little bit boring are like to be a bit more sort of experiment or with the Enoch because I try and I want sort of layers and different flavors that literally is just a strawberry chewy sweet sensation and but yet pretty decent if you like sort of thing I could definitely yeah see you see that one being a good one for ya know but anyway let's come back and let's try a rhubarb and custard okay so we're back now and I've been loading up this is rhubarb and custard and it's literally just says it's a subtle balanced blend between sweet rhubarb and sultry custard base I'm assuming it's gonna be like the old sweets and they're like reading yellow card boiled candy and they too bad I don't like the real flavor of a revolver from honest review but I don't mind the sweets is such when we set a rush out and buy myself same price free for 995 five for 49 for free no and I on its own and let's give it then in the back of my throat that one Oh have a sip [Applause] [Music] again tastes exactly like the sweet in fact thank you for like this one I think I was gonna say that by actually quite like this one mmm it tastes exactly like sweet sour flashbacks from the olden days when I was a boy yes tastes exactly like the sweet it tastes like a a sweet candy rosemarie with a sort of sweet over-the-top custard and look like a real smooth custard in any way shape or form it's like a the only way just to explain is to have tried it really like a typical British candy and but yeah pretty decent in fact I'm gonna bring the shortly to down to 6.5 because it was a little bit boring if I'm dead be honest with you and that's what it's channels were about the honesty and however that one it's actually not that bad and I didn't think I was gonna like that but yeah that's pretty good I'm going to give that one a 7 so yeah definitely downgrade these strawberry chew alright let's try the next one which is a mr. O'Casey load up and yeah he's a Heisenberg type play he says hisin who the mysterious blue now in a fantastical crystal clear blend with Mahomet molecular perfection now I'm not a fan of Heisenberg I know something rather absolutely love it and they rave over the stuff and I've never liked it for some reason just never from day one just didn't get on with it at all it was too overpowering too fruity to to everything really I mean it it's fine on a smaller pot type thing where you're not getting the hit and that's what I can kind of understand it in the salts but when you go into the sub own stuff and you're doing off of that it's just far too much for me and by its creator series is light because although this smells exactly like it does it does have something in there that is slightly different to the original solve ampere vapes light one so it's give it no yep now it is like Heisenberg but it's not exactly like the the original Heisenberg back again I didn't think I'd say is actually quite nice and I can see in a small pod that that would be that would be pretty decent it's way to explain Heisenberg it's just it's just such a mash of flavors that you can't really pinpoint any of them and I think that's what I don't like about it's just fruits a little bit of ice and berries blueberries fake berries sweetie berries real bear it's just a complete concoction of weirdness to me and but as I say that's that's probably the best best Heisenberg I've tried and I've tried a lot of them and that ain't Hank bad hmm again I can see in a small pod you know where it's a lot a lot less Soviet going into your each time that wouldn't be actually that bad I'm actually quite surprised with that one that was one night I definitely four weren't gonna like and I'm gonna give that one I'm not gonna be too generous I'm gonna give it a 6.5 normally they'd get like fours and fives so many Eisenberg's but yeah that ain't bad oh that's probably is the best Heisenberg I've ever tried mister why yeah pretty decent okay well that's the end of the salt ones and let's get on with some of these bigger ones here we let's start off with tangy twister okay so is a tangy twister is it's a take on they say just like the lollies with a lime I swirl and raspberry and what is if you've never seen one where have you been and but it's like a twist of lime with a twist of ice cream like a vanilla ice cream and then like a red in the middle sort of thing and which is the raspberry and which is quite interesting and I actually don't mind them they're not my sort preferred to Malik and sure is heady and I have tried a lot of these types of e-liquids um so it's gonna be to see what these ones are like and hmm very weird one thing I will say which is really really good about these they've got them leads on that I love and they've got like a little hinge to them so what you do is you push up okay if it pushes up nice and easy and then you could just flip the lid over and the leave that she stays on and you can put your nicotine in nice big hole as well and then you just pop it back down and jump done some of the bottles especially cuz I do so many of them are bloody nightmare so getting these is really really good it's nice to see they've gone for them and more let's get trying this one Oh put that on the oven oh yeah let's see what this is like then oh wow hmm really strong really nice actually hmm yeah you're getting that lime you're getting that raspberry tastes just like the lollies the lollies got a very strange taste to it and they've nailed that is again pretty decent that's another one again I thought I weren't going to like but that is pretty decent and these aren't cheap and they're definitely not the bargain type ones and two for $19.99 found and four or $12.99 for just the 150 meal or C grade your nicotine which is what quid you're looking around 14 quid for a bottle with used to bar on its own so it's not cheap but but I think bad at all bang that's up there with the best of them as far as twisted Ollie's go hmm yeah that's pretty decent I'm gonna give that a 7 yeah pretty nice mmm yeah you're getting that line you're getting that sort of vanilla and that raspberry and you're getting that unique twist a la leaf sort of flavor Comics playing well that is but yeah really really good that's one of them ones if you give it to someone and said try that what do you think it is they would know what it is or thing quite often that isn't the case and so that is good to know yeah a pretty decent anyway let's try the next one which is the black okay so be lonely something this is the black and it's a blackcurrant mint phille with a black currant undertone Oh a blackberry meant for with a black currant undertone that makes more sense I was a bit confused there yeah wish I'm cleared about because I thought it was gonna be like a licorice the black don't like licorice you're gonna see two things that so yeah that's good to know so a blackberry mint phul with black currant undertone seems like actually just pop this wattage up a little bit more it's on let's try there no no strawberries funky hmm let's go wait taste you that one yeah it tastes like like black currants and blackberries but it's got I think it's that meant for the menthol is not very nice meant for in that one and it kind of leaves you male feeling a little bit dry yeah not a fan in this one it's like the very smallest amount of black currant you kind of get its black berry and you get that weird mint full taste and the tiny bit of black currant at the end that leaves my mouth feeling dry I'm not a fan of that one at all gonna give that a 5 as always this is an honest review I will only ever be honest and yeah that's a 5 I'm not a fan of that one at all yeah even now my mouth feels very very dry mmm I know I'm right next up let's try another one from up there badass blends and this is a freaky fruits okay so a freaky of fruits is a mango and melon that is freaky that is a weak combination and very strange yeah you don't tend to get mango and watermelon together and watermelons a very strong flavor and mango is a very strong flavor so it's very interesting to see what one wins that fight yeah I like watermelons not a fan of mango but then that was it mango Pina Colada where it was we tried on the DIY one if you don't watch for DIY videos there on a Friday go check them out and one of the nicest ones I've ever joined so yeah it's going to be interesting it says it's a mouth-watering blend of summer fruits melon and just a hint of corner so there's a bit of coulis in there as well treat your taste buds to a tingle called sherbert as well and a fresh fruity enjoyable vape well okay so this quite a bit going on in there and yeah definitely yeah yeah freaky fruits and let's give it a go I've weed [Music] oh that's very weird let's like a car crash it's like you know you shouldn't be looking but you can't open look you it tastes weird but you kind of try knitting in really weird this looks you get like watermelon and you're getting a bit of mango and you get a bit of a I must be the sherbert in there and it's kind of like watermelon mango sherbert watermelon mango sherbet won't show up mango what there it's all over the place it's proper Magnus I've seen what I called you there it's very strange I thought no he's saying I'd want a vape on all day every day but it's very addictive yeah you kind of get the watermelon first and then a little bit sherbert and then you get that sort of in note of the mango and then it just sort of explodes into a combination of the three of them all over the place I don't know well think about that one and I supposed to the long term I probably wouldn't vape it that much because it's very peculiar very peculiar and it's weird I'll give it a six I'm sure bear that one that it's very strange probably not one I'd recommend you get and buy because it's very very weird and but it's what I would say you've got a try if you ever do get it um-hmm first Ranger [Applause] yeah really really strange yeah I'll give it a 6 for now right I'm gonna leave the to the guilt and innocence ones to last let's try these iced ones and let's start with this one first showing and probably the one I'm probably not gonna like the most at the whole lot iced mango okay so iced mango is as you'd expect it's an iced mango flavor tropical mango with a Memphis infused for the die-hard cool effect vapors which I definitely am NOT I don't want a little bit of calling especially in the hotter climates recently went to America and when I've been abroad before sometimes when you're vaping like the the bakeries and things like that they're kind of not quite right in the hot and it's a bit stranger so I used to get it with cigarettes as well funny enough just weed sensation so the ice was quite nice it kind of ball that thought vapor back to being normal and but here in England I'm not a massive massive fan of them especially when they're on the heavy side and I've tried some that are just ridiculous and I find it takes a flavour way most importantly and so it might not be too bad it is on ice mango might get rid of that mango flavor because I'm not fan of that Eva and but yeah and it smells really strong like mango let's give it a go yeah it clears your nose that immediately that's great if you've got a cold brilliant Jojo what the ice isn't as bad as I thought was gonna be he's more of that meant for why so he's more of a minty sort of flavor as opposed to just the ice so it's not too bad in that sense it tastes like a realistic mango and then at the end makes you go that's all thing and that's not actually as ice as I thought was gonna be fishy the fact they're saying is for the die-hard cool effect vapor so if you really like that ice this isn't going to be as strong as they're making out to be completely honest and I can vape it so it can't be that strong yeah yeah and but yeah it tastes taste like a realistic mango you know God giving points for that you know it does take that real mango nice and smooth yeah it's might do that back it's not really as bad as I thought was gonna be been a few of these in here a lot of these I was moaning the beginning one another they didn't simmer the ones that I sort of asked for and yet I've quite enjoyed quite a few of these ones mmm yeah I mean actually that bad and I could easily vote that although if you like your mango and you want a little bit of mini coolness in there that'd be really really good in fact I'm gonna give that one a 7 that's pretty decent of them are now right next up another iced one which is iced punchy pineapple okay so yeah this is iced punchy pineapple and they're saying is best pineapple with citrus and mental notes flavors and blender smooth trip Corvo coupled with an additional sweet citrus notes the end notes of citrus give plenty punchy depth and dimension and does not overpower the blend yeah weird one and whenever I get sent - well I think oh I have a lot pineapple but I always enjoyed vaping pineapple for some reason it can't make me cough no and then not as bad as Pierre became a week off yeah I always seem to end up enjoying pineapple and if you don't watch my videos regularly there's one stage for probably a few months ago where I was really into pineapple what couldn't stop fighting pineapple so it's one of them weird ones I've come into serious like with that iced in there hopefully it's like the ice from the mango one in its he's more of a compliment as opposed to the flavor such so that would be nice if that is the case and the citrus notes on the end that could be interesting so let's give this one a try as well Oh [Applause] well that's what we'd flag to her that one try sniff it with a little now every now and then you're getting eat liquid and I've said this before and it's only one way to say it it smells a bit pissy yes but I thought we and and I'm kind of getting it from that and you get two types I've found over the years one is that sort of we smell you have one is that six meal and that's definitely the we smell going on it and it it puts me off because obviously as you get a vape it's right near your nose and you can't help smell it and I think that's what it is it tells the mind it smells like we and then you vape it and it's like it confuses me yeah and yeah I'm not sure about that one yes it's got funny takes to me that one I'm not liking that one and you'll give that one off or something about it I thought I was gonna like it as I say I do quite like pineapples now and then but that smell just puts me off it it does smell it does taste like pineapple II it's an odd pineapple it's a very old soul flavoured pineapple and then that ice kicks in to be fair the ice bar bit is the best part of that liquid that's nice they like a nice mint fleece or a refresher sort of thing and the citrus many set most that pineapple working about citrus but just gives you that odd sort of flavor to it yeah not a fan of that one at all yeah anyway let's try the next two now these are the tour but people looking forward to the most if I'm going to leave that one to last because that looks like it's gonna be lovely let's try this from the mango banana and apricot innocence okay so we're back now and we've got some fresh coils on and this is the mango banana an apricot here comes some really sober it's part of the innocent guilty range mmm what bloody smells fantastic jeez I did not expect that I was gonna smell disgusting oh that smells really really nice and they're the same sort price $12.99 39 iron plus your nicotine so you're looking around 14 15 quid a bottle for 50 60 meals offing and don't know whether they do these in 10 mil balls it might be the madam timber balls but again if it's ten mil he's not the soldier we're looking around three four quid I suppose but this house Wow nationals absolutely fantastic it really really does mmm want to try this one it doesn't taste as nice as it smells [Applause] no that does not taste as nice as it smells then that's what that apricot Wow I'm not a messy messy fan of apricot in fact I don't even like the real thing you start off with that mango flavor again is that nice realistic mango they don't in that ice one but without the ice obviously which is lovely the banana kicks in it's all smooth and beautiful and then bang on the end you've got apricot it just overtakes everything just pure apricot and oh if you like apricot you love it if you don't you hate it like me and that's that's very apricot heavy very a boat oh if they got me to that ate the corner which is mango banana that'd be really nice really really nice but I forgot he's very very strong in there and as I said I'm not a fan of apricot yes a shame because the mango and banana works really well funny enough and but for me that apricot just comes over and just destroys it a bit and I'm going to give that I'll give it a five point five five seems a bit too harsh but yeah it's probably personal preference that one but try one more time [Applause] yeah it's just the apricot for me it's always like an apricot jam at the end it's quite a thick feeling like a really concentrated apricot but yeah I'll give that a 5.5 yeah let me take these guns and then let's try this one with one I've been waiting for the white chocolate cranberry pistachio okay so yeah this is the white chocolate cranberry and pistachio from their guilty range and obviously there's two types my hair smells just the hash smells even better oh that's absolutely beautiful let's load it up double load this up because this is gonna be good um it's gonna be good it has to be good there there's three flavors there that I absolutely love and it has to be good yeah so again 70/30 VG PG same sort of price range 50ml short for bottles yeah let's try it there's really nice the white chocolates not not pronounced it's not a massively strong white chocolate but then white chocolate liveries really it's a very subtle flavor almost like a cream but it's pistachio the pistachio is lovely really really nice and then you get that sort of creamy white chocolate and then you just get a little hint of cranberry at the image just brings like a sweet flavor to the mixture sort of thing I quite like that one again it's not a it's not a strong flavored a liquid but it's a it's a nice nice of an old day vapor and that's really really nice the cranberry works really well in there as well it's a strange combination as you pistachios and cranberry white chocolate but free individual flows doesn't say that I love and yeah actually works pretty well yes it's pretty good I'm gonna give that one I'll give that one a 7.5 not bad all right well that's the end of this review and thanks for sticking with me bit of a long one there was quite a few to try though I did have mine are about making into two videos but I just want to knock it out and get them all out there and try them all and so yeah if you've got this far congratulations well done and also as I said I'm also gonna be doing the giveaway before the vaporous so extra and the video that I did so the winner of that is so if you let me know down below I'll stick my email down below just send me your address and I'll get it sent out as soon as I can and so you get congratulations for that but yeah as a general range from what I can tell ya obviously these are sent to me for review but I am only ever honest you know I will be honest you know in my upset people things that I go be honest is know there's some there that are pretty good this something that I've done like it all but generally there's nothing out there none in that whole group really that that blows me away now whether that be because the fact that they've sent me flavours that I don't particularly like anyway or not it probably is and but from the ones that I've found I'd say this all of I don't know sort of seven to eight sort of thing all the way through there are some companies out there they're a bit up quite simply and then there are some egos out there that blow these out the water and their price range with what I've tried I probably wouldn't recommend him as a range of God be honest as I say the pistachio one was probably the best one that I tried the others they were all pretty average it from daily honest Rivia and in saying that the Knicks also football quite impressive so if you're into the pods things like that they're different so I'll have a look at but yeah I guess in general you have to try them yourself let me know down below what you thought you know these are all just personal preferences everyone's different so let me know if you've tried on but yeah I feel a little bit this point with the range and single around for a long long time and I thought they were going to be better and as I said that could be kind of simple fact that they sent me flavors that I'm not massive fan off the begin with by anyway I hope you enjoyed the video and again thanks for watching

purpose of this review and they described this one as the succulent nectar of a pineapple was integrated seamlessly into a smooth gummy blend similar to the gummy taste in peach rings to form this sweet tooth satiating vape okay so they're going for peach rings has a nice label max BG six milligrams nicotine 17.5 ml bottle and it's mostly clear with a little bit of a yellowish tint child safety cap and a pointed tip yeah it definitely smells like gummy peach rings smells really good for this review i'm using the k box 200 with the feral RDA on top it's built a point 14 homes and i'll be starting at 80 watts okay so it does taste a little bit like gummy and a little bit like peach but it actually has a kind of a floral taste six milligrams nicotine it's very smooth after a few drags that floral tastings to go away the gummy flavor and the peach flavor very light it's good but not as much flavor as i would like but if you do like light flavors I think you probably like this one there a juices are really affordable you can get 65 mil bottles for 899 125 ml bottles for 1599 210 mil bottles for 2499 and sample packs of 7 15 ml bottles for 1599 and you can pick those up at Van val vapor calm", "avs1xgFy1a0": "hello all of YouTube and welcome to this brand new channel Pro CBD my name is Jason and I am the owner of cent website Pro CBD it's WWWE BD calm for all your CBD products and needs yeah we're a small outfit just starting out in the CBD world happy to help people all of our products on the website have third-party lab reports so none of it is this snake oil and stuff that's around my room which is highly expensive and has nothing in it ours is all all proven tried and tested so starting off today I'm going to do a review but going forward on this channel we will be doing discussions reviews CBD in the news or do a second on that what's going down in the UK what's big at the moment some giveaways that's pretty much it but we've got so many decent products to talk about that we'll be doing a lot of a lot of that so today we're going to start off with first review and I've picked one of the hundred that we've got products and I'm going to talk about CBD FX make it soluble cause I started out well I still do I've made that's what sort of brought me into the CBD world suffer with anxiety thought well you know why not give it a bash and it has helped I can't say these completely cured the situation because it hasn't and I'm not here to lie to you guys but it definitely takes the edge off for me so it's really good anyway so I have open this and I have been using it but I've boxed it back up so you guys can see what's in the box so I can't believe you have instructions if you are male throw it you're female have a quick read in the box you have your mod tiny tiny little mod in the pictures you can't really tell but it is perfect I love a little more I hate massive box mods pull your trousers down and stop type devices this is tiny really handy so we'll stick that most you stick that there for a second right and then in the box you've got your tank here are the magnetic collars and these screw on to the 510 thread and I'll show you in a minute you just drop it in the mod and it just sticks in with the magnet so it's really handy and then you've got your power cable so nothing too exciting packaging wise pretty cool lock the magnetic lid on there you've got thousand milliamp battery rechargeable it's built in battery but so far I've had like three days out of it without aphids charges so I mean I vape it I don't rape it I'm sort of stuck no more words there or a vein all day long and I'll pick this up at certain time so it's not like all day I'm on this one because I've got like cloud frying sort of mods as well but I do use it a lot and I'm getting good battery life out of it so I'm pleased with that right back to getting the tank out and showing you guys how it all works right so when you first get it out you have to take one of these magnetic collars out they give you two which is handy and where I was talking about the 510 where the camera lens it's that side the 510 thread there basically this piece just screws on so that state of my hands been working on my car today right unscrew that there's your normal standard 510 and then you just get this mad magnetic bit here things in the way and then just screw and then with the mod if you look down there got a tiny little hole let me place that in there I can do it in the camera drop it in it's as simple as that on this side here you've got a window to see how much CBD you've got it's very clear you can't see it so that's handy on the bottom you've got preventing CBO FX label there 95 on one two three four five one two three visit one two three four five all right it's on anyway that's probably why I couldn't see in the light so basically when you hit the fire button it's blue when it's fully charged it's blue and then when it's nice charging his red there's no in-between color stages on this one but like I said I haven't even seen the red bit yeah they're not being using it for three days straight now so it's definitely good right okay so today I'm gonna be doing a full review this week at the Harmony range so if you guys have heard of it but it is amazing really good it's earthy which a good CBD should be really in my opinion but it's so like the strain like if you ever were a smoker or still are a smoker of the herbal kind then when you when you make this it'll be like wow all it takes you back to your old days will take you back to yesterday one of the two right tank take that out and then basically on the top you under scrutiny R and then this works a little bit like the pocket X by Aspyr if you wears them there it goes you've got a 1 mil fill line so basically fill it up to I will give you a little pointer that goes slightly under the 1 mil line because when I fill up exactly on the one new line I get a tiny little bit of spillage at the top of the glass this is glass by the way which is cool the coil is part of the chimney so once this burns out I've had a look online we haven't got them in stock yet but we'll be getting them the whole thing is what you just replace it which is very strange I think they should have unscrewed that coil head from the chimney and then you could have just replaced the coil was it seems like a complete waste of product if that is the case the whole thing that whole thing have to chuck away well the whole thing and I'll keep that just in case you broke one but I mean it's pointless you could have just had the call screw onto the chimney I never mind all right screw that on there that's good right air flows at the top you see you've got it three holes there so you've got that there you can just twist it I like it fully open because like I said I solo anyway so there's much [ __ ] yep look better drop it in your mod and then have a little toke so yeah moment I'm getting no vape whatsoever what you seen 2% that sounds bad that's better so basically I'm not going to end it any other videos it's just as you see is what you get my life's too busy for muck about medicine plus I feel that as a customer if I make a mistake and you're watching it you won't make the same mistakes or you probably will but you know litchi you can see the pitfalls of everything that then was basically just picked it up dropped it back in and then it was falling obviously wasn't connected at the five tenant someone on tape really nice so this is designed specifically for CVD so low wattage doesn't burn all the terpenes off prior to them getting into your lungs which is good another one so that is it for my first video short and sweet please subscribes

y'all trevor here with ride of the leaf and today we're going to be diving into a 5 10 cart from the back 40 you guys this uh new er new newer lp on the alberta market has uh forbidden fruit for its cartridge i'm really curious to see how it's gonna do and uh how it's gonna taste you guys so let's get this intro in here and dive into this cartridge before we uh before we go into our friday sativa strain review i'll see you guys on the other side of the intro where we're diving into the forbidden fruit cartridge by back 40. cheers welcome back you guys so as i said in the intro we're going to be diving into forbidden fruit from back 40. i'm really curious to see how uh how these cartridges are going to do they aren't a company i heard very much about but the packaging is very interesting and unique to this company the cartridge feels like it's got kind of a unique shape um forbidden fruit and cushmits being um the end of oh i i almost forgot about the super lemon haze so the super lemon haze forbidden fruit and cushman's from uh back 40 seem like really interesting strains come out with really rich flavorful strains potentially and honestly it just seems like a fun company to dive into and see how it's gonna do and after we did the sativa last week we're gonna be diving into an indica this week so the only information that i was able to find quickly for this strain review is on the global news wire it's an article about the back 40 company and it just has a little bit of information for each of its cartridges so we're just going to quickly rattle off for all three leading off with the forbidden fruits the one we're going to dive into before we go into the actual information on this package and then into our full review you guys so forbidden fruit is an indica with citrus and earthy taste notes from the d limonene and maracinine botanical terpenes cushman's is their hybrid option with a refreshing burst of mint taste with menthol and d-lemonine botanical terpenes and super lemon haze is a sativa packed citrus and floral taste with botanical terpenes of d-limonene terpinaline maracinine and carefully so this one we're gonna be getting a uh citrusy earthy combination i'm really interested to see how that combination is gonna do you guys we uh have that package ripped open there we are going to get the urban scale intro in here right after we give the information off the package 80 thc 00 cbd and a package date of september 19th you guys it's time to get into the full-blown urban scale i'll see you on the other [Music] side [Music] get this open comes with a nice simple package on the outside and all in all the cartridge itself is nice simple design good really interesting red mouthpiece on it but i don't mind the overall design of the cartridge we can get this thc sticker off you guys so you know exactly what i'm oh this one doesn't want to come off easily okay look at that clear sticker off let's try the other side i don't think this one's going to come off quickly and easily guys okay let's just forget about that and we're going to dive right into the taste from a g pen you guys just because like i said in the last one the fireside battery died on us so we are stuck just with the g pen until we can get some more 510 batteries in stock at the shop for me to be able to grab one but the way we do our taste through the vape is we run it with the lowest temperature talk about it a little bit then the medium temperature talk about it for a bit and then we run it to the highest temperature and finally talk about it through a bit there i find each temperature has a little bit of a different experience a little bit of a different flavor and that's why we break down like that after we then go through the glass and do the exact same thing all three temperatures through each piece of glass to see each experience and overall development of flavor as you dive deeper into the cartridge you guys and after that we give it the score for the g pen the glass and a score out of 10 for the high we are going to be using the more updated score the scoring system where that one to two range is gonna be non-smokable that three to four is going to be on the harsher side but it can still have some enjoying points five to six is going to be the tolerable where the enjoyment is starting to outweigh the negatives that seven to eight is going to be the enjoyable and more optimal place for these to want to aim for and the 9 out of 10 is pristine and that's really going to be my personal preference the my upper echelons of the buds this was recommended by some viewers and it seems like everyone enjoyed it the last time when we dove into it with the concentrate so we're gonna do it with the cartridge this time you guys but we've got the bak 40 forbidden fruit indica dominant cartridge on here we uh we should dive into this you guys and see how it's gonna do i'm really curious haven't heard much about this company but i enjoyed this strain when i smoked it from quest in the bud form so now it's time to see how it'll do in the concentrate form from back for you guys cheers and i will see you on the other side when uh we've got the first taste of this forbidden fruit cart down and out cheers wow you guys so first experience on this you did kind of get that earthy almost even kind of leafy that urban herb kind of taste the green greens of a plant kind of taste and then it hits you with this really heavy um citric not necessarily um not necessarily like a sweet lemon but more like crystallized lemon or lemon juice like the really tart and almost cool lemon citric attack for the flavor and that really was what it was it was an attack on my taste buds and i enjoyed it quite a bit you guys but it was different for the experience i've got the second temperature loaded up on here let's dive in and see how this forbidden fruit crossover of that kind of earthy leafy taste with the lemon is on the second half you guys cheers and i'll see you on the other side hey guys so i found it had a really similar experience at this level too it really does balance a little bit better at the medium level it wasn't so much of an attack of that lemon flavor but more of a rush like it was like taking a drink of a lemonade that has too much too many lemons squeezed into it not enough sugar was really what it was or um like the straight lime curse out that you get in the bottle but they let like an extra sour tart edition of it or just straight lime juice like that kind of flavor and honestly it's it's enjoyable to have that wave of citrus but i wish it had a little bit of a sweeter touch to it just honestly for my purple personal preference but it's been enjoyable so far we've got the highest temp now ready to go let's dive into it and see how it's going to uh taste and overall how this g pen is going to score you guys i'll see you on the other side of this last rip before we dive into the glass side of the review guys um okay wow that actually kind of developed or deteriorated depending on the person that's looking at it i personally really am enjoying it and it does have an overall quite enjoyable experience but it's leaning more to that asset licorice flavor for me at that highest temp which was not something i expected at all it was not something i could have expected from this cartridge especially when we were getting that really earthy flavor into that really tart lemon combo i i didn't think a kind of an anise licorice combo would will come out of that but it's not bad it's just all in all different so i'll give it us you know what i am going to give it a 7 out of 10 because it wasn't enjoyable it definitely was enjoyable with the 7 out of 10. it just at the last one it was a little bit kind of like what so i would i would definitely enjoy hauling out of this at the lower temperatures as more of a sipping cartridge not really a like the tropic girl scout cookies from last week that's a haul cartridge but for this week this one's a sipper now we're going to sip our way through the glass we've got six rips to dive into you guys i think i'm gonna cough a lot on this one but uh what what can we do about it let's uh dive into it and see how this cartridge does when you add a little bit of some water filtration on it first two rips we're just gonna press the button and haul the last one we will preheat before we press that button so that we are taking it at the highest level because why not experience it all this ain't pokemon but it's a good hell of a good stoner close-up don't try and catch them all let's try and smoke them all cheers y'all let's dive into it so we pre-heat that last one let's dive into it y'all cheers okay guys we're about halfway through this and i've got a theory i'm working on it we've got three more wheat three more weeks we've got three more rips that will really make the determination on uh whether my theory is right or not um i'll let you guys know at the end but uh hopefully i don't get too high and forget i don't think i will but i'll see you guys on the other side of the next three reps cheers well folks let's let's dive into it again cheers lowest highest i'll see you on the other side and we'll talk about my theory let's dive into it last time preheat it and dive into it cheers okay guys now should i give you the score or should i give you my theory first you know what i'll give you the score and then i'll work it into my theory afterwards i think that'll be the best way to do it so the score is going to be a 6 out of 10. so it's right on that top upper end of the tolerable side now that actually does feed quite well right into my theory so most of these 510 cartridges are going to be heating up to 0.15 of your oil in the chamber that actually has the wick and he is heated and vaporizing every time so with a review like this where i'm pounding out this many um this many rips between 20 to 30 minutes i'm breaking down the terpenes and not giving the cartridge enough time to cool down and really have everything balance out um to give it the optimal flavor between rips however i think this is going to be allowing me to review the the cartridge a little bit more honestly because if the flavor is just as good on the 12th with 12 13 14 15 rip of this review if we have the second battery 12 if we if we don't um if it just there's there's just disappointment when the the oil and everything starts to break down earlier and that's that's really why i think the way i'm smoking it is going to give you guys a more more honest review because that oil and the flavor should hold up and really the tropic girl scout cookies from last week that's going to be my card to compare because not only did it hold up on that review it's still holding up today it's a little bit softer on the flavor but not much definitely a lot less loss in flavor than i was originally expected so it's still doing incredibly well in a lot higher standard than i was originally expecting but it it did really well you guys and that's why this cartridge is going to get that 6 out of 10. now moving on into the high i'm going to give it a 6 out of 10 as well it was somewhat enjoyable until we got about the second rip into the glass you guys and then i started to get this creeping headache and every time i sipped that a card out afterwards it just built and built and built and now it's a really heavy kind of back of my head headache that creeps into my neck and it just kind of tension my shoulders and in my traps and it just it's not enjoyable you guys and i i'm not having that bit of a time however on the lower level this is a really nice card i am feeling that this card would do incredibly well as a complimentary or a balancing card where you're smoking it and there's something else that there's something else that you're smoking with it to get that heavier high and honestly it's it's enjoyable and it is something that i would consider trying again but it's not something i would consider buying again you guys um but the other two cartridges from back 40 definitely would be interesting to try out i've heard the cushions is quite minty quite menthol experience and i was a fan of the house too that was like that and i'm just a fan of that really cooling mint experience so we might have to go and check that one out as well but for the time being you guys we're going to wrap this one up tomorrow it is looking like we are going to be reviewing

blame Christmas this time it was Christmas fault a lot of presents family that kind of stuff overall I think good well anyway um seems like time and go anyway this time I have been sent some da vapor to review I've got apple apple fizz xxx and pineapple chill Darth if you've seen my other videos you'll see that I've reviewed previously probably a first site review some dark paper products as a massive fan of these these are two newer products not brand new but they are newer products and I've not yet tried have been sent them to try so I'll give you an honest opinion on what of course we're gonna go for the pineapple chill I've filled up my Scott bottle up which is already it's called a deep layer banging banging RDA tons of flavor but there was no juice well so it just pisses out you but anyway I digress to digress let's get on this so the juices come in 70/30 so definitive easy peasy is that right that is right 50 mil bottles I'll leave a link where you can get these kind of you've got a massive massive range you need to check it out they've got the peace xxx range a fruit Eve chill range desserts custards you name it they've got they've got massive hardcore loyal fan base they've just taken over or merged with Kraft Cohen of a decent UK vendor and just get right to it let's quit the chitchat start some more chitchat we're gonna go for the upper the Apple is triple x the color of this is fantastic it looks like it will be terrible for you look at that green that's some hot blood right there we all know that anything that looks like it's going to do you how taste fantastic I'm not seeing that's gonna do me how it just looks nuclear I like it I like the look of it a lot so rocked out got on it I forgot your flat wired your flat why I built a little bit 19 G so you've got obviously it's gonna be basic labor Apple there's no layers is no nothing to it it is an apple flavor but it's not like a refreshing kind of like you'd expect a granny smith apple this is your candy like rosy apple kind of sweet I'm gonna say it's not a nice way to use but artificial Apple it's a good flavor it's a strong flavor it's nice the one thing that's getting me there is a visible X so I think I had the great face xxx and not that has some kind of element that made me think it was kind of busy or or tangy maybe sour I'm not seeing I don't really get this off that so to me it's a nap or face for flex but it's really just an apple flavor a good apple flavor and a little bit disappointed there's no sourness no tanging us know or kind of you know pulling faces son\u00eds or i'm good juice like sec flavors all there yeah there's the only thing you could improve or not is making it a little bit fizzy tangy sour but to me it's just like the sweet candy apples not flavor i'd usually go for but I'm saying if you like candy apples definitely give this shot give this a shot they're 895 will go anyway so try it out all right so that's the Apple finished triple x we're gonna go for the I am mega excited about this this is a pineapple chill and I don't know I like pineapple over still I tried not a juice low blow and that had more of a mental effect than the a chill effect so I'm hoping this is more of like a cooler they're not minty media what I'm saying you go I'm so gonna drip this just on top of that anyway then give a little top of squawk see how this goes that is juicy that is real real juicy very boorish the chill so the market seems to be inundated with with chill call and a kind of effects this isn't as chilling as I thought it would be which is good or good for me because this is just too much of it the market I think this is too much cool out of going on too much to learn the fact that this is just right this is it's not on the inhale or I'm not getting on the inhale but and it's not quite on the exhale it's it's after you've inhaled and exhaled if you breathe back in then you get a chill like kind of like you've just brush your teeth without the mint but the calling chill is there but it's not the same I could be wrong it could be call out of it it doesn't feel like that's what it is but yeah the chills not really really strong it's not prominent the pineapples are all there though that's that could Huff on that all day long pineapple fans trying it out again you can't really say much parties it's a single flavored flavor pineapple pineapple with a bit of chill but it is a very good one at that so as a fan I'm gonna highly highly recommend I'm not going to say I'm not fun it's nice it's well done but it's not something I would choose you go for but if you like up all you like candies that kind of apes definitely worth a shot I don't think you'll be disappointed in that so these are 895 I'll leave a link straight to the to the website and you'll be able to have a look because they've got a massive massive range I've got two more flavors to come up to review hopefully this week that is the mummer's cake which I'm very excited about and what else have I got skills which is another sweet one which will be very interesting because I'm not trying to skip a one yet and also if you keep keep on people who subscribe and tomorrow my channel like I've got as what they call I be G liquids four of them to try four of the sweet ranges coming up so some stuff from Europe I can't remember the name planet' your stuff coming up so yeah if you do like what you see give me a thumbs up give me subscribe thank you for listening smooth chat [ __ ] Deepavali", "9KZh-eoOaB8": "[Music] hello and welcome back to the cannabis sommelier i'm your host andrew friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of cannabis reviews today we have a cool new vape pen from that great legalization 2.0 category of extracts uh really cool company collab project um really enjoying a bunch of things they're putting out they're not an lp they're a processor they're a brand they're a purchaser what they're trying to do is get great things out to market they're not necessarily trying to grow the cannabis which in turn i kind of appreciate so i believe these guys operate under dose cans license um but use the collab project branding i know they do have a standalone store in saskatchewan which is pretty cool where saskatchewan you're able to do your own business directly with the lps and you can have much more specific products in your store and have different pricing agreements and all these other things if you have any questions about that leave it in the comments and maybe i'll go into it a little bit deeper and explain but why did i want to do collab project sativa 1.0 because this is the first one gram cart on market 85 and you get an entire gram super cool when i was reading this is ethanol distillate it's decent distillate i guess 850 milligrams of thc in the one gram extract uh there is this flavor profile is supposed to be strawberry ice um thinking back i don't know if i've ever actually had strawberry ice cannabis so an interesting pick as the flavor profile especially for a sativa and then i also read on the ontario canvas store website that it is mercen dominant so for a sativa to be mercy dominant is why we really don't talk too much about indica sativa in my world because mercy and as we know when inhaled does create more permeability in the blood-brain barrier and one of those reasons why indica or mercy and dominance strains tend to leave you feeling a little bit more intoxicated again if you want to know more about that just leave a comment i'm happy to discuss so collab project has their own battery these are the guys that make the batteries for sherbinsky in the states what i liked about it why i thought i should just even mention it is because it has this cool charger where you don't have to take your cart out and i know that's a big beef with me with the other ones that you have to screw in take your card out so it's quite a bit thicker and i have heard that these carts are a little bit wider as well but pretty cool one gram cart i think i should stop talking and we should dive into it hopefully you agree you can see we still have our duty seal there i think i mentioned these are around 80 85 for the one gram of distillate strawberry ice flavor and let's bust into this and see what we got oh i should see if there's anything else on here cannabis extracts strong cool derived place equivalent to four grams of dried cannabis so that's you know great you can carry around seven of these i'm doing my math right quickly and there's our packaging date and our lot number just so everybody can see it now let's dive in break that duty seal and these are pretty nice they're pinch here a pinch here and i believe these boxes are biodegradable as long as you take the sticker off which again is a pretty nice thought to just think about and there is our cart there's our box i don't think we need the box anymore do you [ __ ] there's our cart looking slick very heavy very heavy in my hand um well i have a scale right here let's weigh it because it does weigh quite a bit it feels very premium in my hand really nice thick big guy i was told that this doesn't work with the vessel battery with the top on but you can take the top off and use it so we'll experiment with that as well 20 grams is what this pen weighs and just for contrast let's look at an old empty one just to see okay so quite a bit of weight we know that there's only one gram of distillate in here but very very heavy in weight contrast super cool like how it looks nice very yellow color looks like good distillate you can see that the bubble doesn't move at all which again is one of those pieces of the silver market the gray market that a lot of people use for an indication of quality on the amount of filler diluting anything in there to see how quickly that bubble moved and the viscosity that was actually inside of this pet so i guess now without further ado we strap it on and we taste it so here's my cool collab battery let's see how this spins on shall we we got our nubbin on the bottom knob and on the top i really like this top piece it feels very sturdy i don't know if it's ceramic or what it might be but it feels great there we go we're all linked in and apparently this pen is optimized for this battery or for this cart so let's check it out no heat settings just an auto pull i wonder if there's a light [Music] okay big rip um it to me right away had some quite mentholy flavors yeah a lot of sweet mint is what i'm getting actually and maybe that's that strawberry ice flavor profile that ice is definitely um relatable to menthol i guess you could see some medicinal kind of cherry properties as well in inside of uh the mentholness but it's definitely the menthol that leaves for me kind of tastes like um the chiller strawberry gum the dentine ice uh cherry gum is what i would relate it to it's not off-putting but it is a little bit medicinal for me um but i'm sure there's lots of people that would really like this flavor profile so distill it looks clean doesn't stink coming out of it let's try with the vessel quick before we uh before we disappear from this video and give it a final review got our vessel vape battery and we know well i know because i was told that it doesn't fit there because it is a larger more premium cart but you can always take that piece off of your vessel and you can screw this down like so like so and you can still use the battery that way so let's try to one two three four five oh and this is on red so i don't want it on red and that's blue that's the lightest setting so let's try this one more time with our vessel battery nice big rip same flavor well it gets me that's a good one on the vessel i feel like i got a bigger rip because i could just press that button and i wasn't relying on myself pull super cool and again this battery comes with a charger that you don't have to take your cart out of you just twist it in like that pretty cool liked it um like that it's a gram like the premium feel feel of the entire pen and a little bit larger stature of it all in all um i guess we break it down with the carts because i can't smell it there isn't really a mark there so i'm just going to give it out of 10 you can relate it into the 100 points but for me i think you know the flavor is all right but it's not crazy it is a distillate pen um so i guess just on grade based on my knowledge of cannabis for products that are similar to this i think it's a good product um you know i think i think it's shooting just shy of an 8 out of 10. let's call that 79. we're going to call it 79 points out of 100. the taste was all right but i'm definitely going to give the taste uh a 75 mark based on other pens on market i think this absolutely wamps them the fact that there's a gram in it the price point is pretty good um pulls nicely i like that they have a battery that goes along with it so yeah let's give it 79 points out of 100 7.9 out of 10 uh pretty good if they could get those terps on point and maybe it's just me a more appealing flavor for me then i would love it but it pulls strong it's a big load everything about it's quite good so thank you so much for watching hope you make sure to like comment share and subscribe until next week cheers what's my name what's my name the cannabis sommelier", "chowUVIcEZU": "hey Trevor here threader leaf and today we've got the indica dominant hybrid monkey glue from good supply I'm really excited to happen to the strain and I hope you guys are looking forward to the review that's coming your way right after this intro see on the other side [Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome back everyone so today we are tapping into some monkey glue from good supply this is an indica dominant hybrid they came in with a THC of 15.1% so right on that mid range marker a CBD total of greater than 0.75 per set or put 7 1% sorry my bad you guys and a package date of April 22nd 2020 I've got the information for this strain pulled up from the lifting Co website we're just gonna dive right into that you guys before we get going on this so get stuck with monkey glue these chunky resin covered buds deliver pungent earthy and sour aromas there is no monkey around when it comes to this potent high THC sativa dominant strain you'll definitely develop a bond they say sativa dominant strain on here but I've picked up a one-gram pre-roll and I found it to be a little bit more indica dominant so we're definitely doing this on the Monday for the indica dominant strange you guys so the top 4 effects found when smoking the monkey glue is gonna be calming happy pain relief and appetite enhancing the top 4 activities that are just used for is going to be watching TV socializing listening to music and sleeping top method and consumption is via the joint and it's got earthy sweet citrus and sweet smells this is really really interesting because the one Gumpy role that i got of this and have tried out actually reminded me a lot of a gorilla glue strain which I'm quite surprised to find that this doesn't have any sort of mention of gorilla glue on here at all but we're gonna get into the herbage scale you guys we're gonna start out with a look and aroma on these buds I'll see you guys over there when we get going into the real part to this review I'll see on the other side of the urban scale a new intro [Music] welcome back guys and as you saw we just ripped open this bag so top into this and see how these buds do so when you open this up you do get hit with a really strong sweet citrus kind of a smell I am getting a little bit of a peppery smell in there as well let's just dump this whole bag out onto the the tray and see how it does you guys get all that loose stuff too so we can smoke that so it comes with a couple of really nice buds we'll start out with that one there here will get you to focus on there there we go nice dark green almost an emerald color on there decent color coating get that out of focus to focus back on this ugly mug there it is you do get a little bit of pistol shooting through there but not as many as I usually like to see when you get it closer the buds are drier they tend to fall apart when you give them a squeeze so that's gonna knock some points off it the crystal coating although it is consistent and really strong golden colors throughout the entire bud it's still not overwhelming again it's got a nice color a nice coating of the crystal to it but it's nothing to really scream to the hills about with how dry the bud is the moderate smell I'm getting off of it I'm gonna give it a seven out of a 10 because I am a little bit excited to try this but by no means am i over the hill jumping for joy excited to try this the dryness of the bud and the lack of oomph with the smell is gonna be the two key things that knock this down points to the 7 out of 10 you guys so here we got the full 8 right there in the buds nothing really exciting about it you guys but I'm gonna bust it up roll up a joint packed of 8 pack the bowls you know how this goes I'll see guys when we get over to that side of the review and we actually start smoking on this bud cheers guys and I'll see you over there hey guys so we got the battlements vaporizers are here charging up to get us that 175 marker so that's where we're gonna start out trying this but out through the vape after that we bump it up to the 205 and 220 to finish it off so 175 really gives us the optimal level to taste those lemon and lighter boiling markers for the terpenes and it gives us a really light and sweet taste the 205 gives us more of those earthy muggy kind of tones that more of the terpenes are known for putting out definitely more of those leafy tones as well the greens and then once we get it near the end you get more into those spiced and woody tones we've got it set to the 175 let's start out on the sweet side and see how this bud does all the way through it you guys and we'll have the rating at the end let's tap into it okay so relatively sweet relatively citrus as well but nothing crazy overall for enjoyment or anything along those lines it's a nice light citrus kind of leafy green flavor doesn't have anything really exciting to grab ahold of and really attach yourself to to enjoy but it's got enough there to enjoy the hints of the flavor we're now up to the 2:05 let's see how it does at this Tempe as so you go with definitely more of a peppery flavor I'm finding a little hint of wood to which is not what I'm expecting at this temperature it's definitely has a really strong woody flavor there you guys we're just gonna bump it up to 20 and see what kind of flavor we get through here cuz if it's the wood again I don't think this buds gonna do real well again that really nice and light woody flavor which actually isn't that bad at the - - honey it's definitely better than the 205 like it's nothing overwhelming for flavor definitely nice and light and mild but it has something at this higher temperature that's a little bit more enjoyable than I've experienced through the rest of it I am not sure what it is you guys but I'm gonna give this one a 7 out of a 10 because it had some enjoyment to it for sure definitely had the most of that 220 it is a nice mild tasting bud through the vape that kind of has its own little appeal you guys it's definitely worth checking out if you like that kind of woody lemony vape flavor i I can't really describe it better than that it it was really lackluster with the amount of flavor that it had but it was still mildly enjoyable and it it deserves this out out of a 10 but definitely no higher than that there was no thought of me going any higher than that for the score but a 7 is I can I can live with a 7 but now it's time to start smoking out of some glass you guys so we got the nice glass beaker bong here when I started out we're gonna smoke with three different ways of lighting the bowl and three different bowls so we got the first bong and Bowl set up here this nice glass one we'll be taking it with the hemp wick our push glass the song bong here that one will be going with a purely clipper lighter and then our straight to cyclone here that suckers are gonna get torch lighted I'm really excited to try this but out I got the one grammar I smoked it a little bit through a silicone rig and I got kind of a diesel tone with it so that's a little bit of the flavor that I'll be looking for when I'm smoking through these three rigs I'm really looking forward to seeing how it does you guys but why wait any longer let's light up the hemp wick and get through some in this first bowl I'll see you guys on the other side of the taste through the three bottles Cheers get that first bowl packed up let's get to y'all Cheers [Music] Second Mile rip straight clipper let's get to it y'all Cheers okay guys I'm gonna give this a six out of a ten for the taste from a bong the biggest thing going for it is it was smooth I didn't find it harsh even though it was a little dry it wasn't overly harsh I was able to take all three rips relatively quick succession and it like I feel a little bit of a cough sitting there but not nothing overwhelming I didn't I definitely have had strains in the recent past recent past that has definitely been a lot harder than this one and this one very smooth very enjoyable through the entire smoke for the bong and I'm interested to see how it's gonna do through the pipe in the joint because I definitely think that's where this bud is gonna excel I think the the filtration through the rigs is going to be the bongs biggest downside just because it is going to dampen the flavor and there might be some really subtle note or flavor that I've been picking up especially through the joint lately that changes that really bland flavor into a really complex flavor very quickly and I'm interested to see if this monkey glue has that kind of a push so you got pickle Rick here or a pack this sumbitch up and it sound [ __ ] we're gonna pack up pickle Rick and see how he does with this monkey glue because I'm quite interested to see how it's gonna do you guys so it's like this uh before we finish it off with the joint I'm I'm enjoying this review so far little disappointed on flavor but still really enjoying smoking this bud cheers you guys okay guys this is gonna be a nice and easy eight for the taste from a pipe let's get this chair in here and get in on you guys a little bit better but it's gonna be a nice and easy aid for taste from a pipe it has a nice strong leafy green citrus push with it and a nice balance mellow spiced flavor to follow up that I wasn't expecting but I'm enjoying a lot more than I I did and I I I'm curious because I think when I light up the bongs again later I might find these Spice this kind of spice flavor because I think it's building on that kind of bland flavor that I had from the bong but now with something a little bit more potent I think I can look for the flavor and find it and those taste from a bong so I enjoyed I enjoyed this taste from a pipe you guys it's got an 8 out of 10 and I think it's well deserved so now we've got the joint here this nice little do be rolled up with some vibes blue let's take a couple dry hauls off it before we light the sucker up smoke halfway through and let you guys know what's going on but let's try it out a little bit first citronella 100% citronella yeah that's exactly and the only thing I taste it's all I taste on this one so I'm gonna light this sucker up we'll see you when I'm about halfway through it cheese y'all pick up I got on the first time [Music] you so you get the nice white ash coming off of this there you go lot of folks focus lock back on the ugly mug we're back to it yeah nice white ash on it burning really well nice and smooth as well it definitely is a lot more gassy than citrus eye it leans more to that diesel kind of flavor and this is more the type of flavor I was expecting through the bongs it's definitely the type of flavor I got through the one gram joint that I picked up and I busted a ended up busting that up and smoking it through the bong and that's the type of flavor I got there this has a good flavor but you can tell the butt is dry all the way through this you can tell it just doesn't lack the punch that it definitely has the potential to have this bud is a little bit disappointing on that side I'm in an ARCA honestly I'm gonna knock two points off that for that overall the flavors mild not it's not horrible I think I'm gonna give it a 7 right now you guys that's the best I can do honestly it's it's something I'd mix off with something with a better flavor it's definitely a more of a stash bud than a headliner it's not something I'd get excited to smoke over for the flavor for sure which is a little bit disappointing and I think if the buds were fresher because the joints were packaged substantially phret fresher when I picked one up so if I pick this up in May or beginning of June when it was still only a month old I think the buds would be a lot better quality but just disappointing you guys a little bit disappointing switching over to the high we can give it an 8 out of a 10 for the high it's a nice and steady mental drift kind of a high it's not overwhelming it's definitely more of that Wow why you're doing something let's have a second kind of that you need something else to distract you like I'm if I go and cook I'm gonna need music her a show or something like that to keep my mind double occupied cuz or else the distraction would be quite easy right forget what you're doing where if you set a task and you can do it like that i guide joy listening to music or watching a show that I don't really need to pay attention to it's just more of the background noise that I really like and this is definitely one of those weeds where I think that'll be quite enjoyable not much for the body a little bit of an ease on the muscle side but not much there when it comes to appetite I can see this one having a boost there it's already starting to get that oh you have an 8 today let's go get something to eat more of that kind of a feel and it's definitely something think might be worth listening to but if you guys give me just a little bit I'll be right back with you guys overall and the last bowl of this review it I think it did pretty well but I'll see if it hit the beautiful urban level in a second there yes yes so this bud ended up getting a forty three out of sixty it's not too bad it definitely lost a lot of punch when it came to the flavor through honestly everything the glass where the the vape it just it was dry and it didn't really have any hit to it some heavy head to it I wish it did for flavor because any of the glue strains I usually really really enjoy but this one just flavor-wise not not doing it yeah so I'm gonna wrap this one up I don't know this is how disappointing the flavor this Bud's been really thrown me off I can't really get into a rhythm and end this video so we're just gonna wrap it up hope you guys enjoy please check out anything else I have up there like comment down below if you had a chest check out this monkey glue what have you thought if not I would say unless it's fresh maybe look for something a little better unless the price point is what you want for 25 bucks their new bucks for the eighth it's not that bad but it was a little disappointing for me you guys YouTube stick around found us who will have an end card just for you but smoke this and just get it over with you guys I'm I'm having a tough time wrapping this one up Cheers hey YouTube I don't know what it is this but just kind of threw me off today and it's not even the hi it's just I couldn't get into it rather than just it's disappointing but I hope you guys enjoyed this video if not please let me know what strain I should go to check out next because I definitely want to redeem myself after this one because there's no way I can put a positive Swit spin on this strain it's just yeah but up in the corner it's gonna be my logo please hover over that

will be the most recommended for you please go and click on either of those or anything else for any leaf has to offer you guys trust me I got a lot more reviews with a lot better bud back later with some more content yes Cheers [Music]", "UXhkmN8i6J4": "[Music] anime fans one piece fans what's good the answer that question of course is one piece one piece is what's good today we are gonna be talking about why Katerina Devon is potentially overpowered and the second strongest woman we have seen in the series stronger than smoothly Bo Hancock even like Jean maybe not Jean young but or even like she could be very very powerful and let me tell you why or maybe not the second strongest but like in the top five her devil fruit at the inu in you know me model QB or nine tailed fox which refers to a kitsune and I did some research I actually made this video before when I first started my channel but it didn't get a lot of views on remaking it but I did some research to show that kitsune are over powered let me just review some of the kitsune abilities the kitsune is able to shape-shift it can track its thing they can transform into anything found in nature that means they can turn into trees for us rocks water or other people we possibly saw this or we might not have in Chapter nine twenty five I'll elaborate that at the end of this meeting next ability they have is Fox fire by wrapping their tails together get to make and make lightning or fire that consumed a can also to a small range we've out fire it to make can also make small Fox lanterns by producing small balls of fire flow around them guide their way this fire can be used as a weapon or as a toy of course the vod's not can be using it as a toy but still the kitsune is also able to mines piece a form of mind control the kitsune A's ability of quote/unquote seduction is one of the most commonly mentioned skills and legends by using various details or tail in a swaying manner or by meeting the gaze of a target but soon a is able to take over their mind while under the control of the kitsune the victim sees thinks and lives and oral designed by the Coutu names all inside the target's mind now this is Auvergne powered this is like ridiculously overpowered and that's not all [Music] and the next one has is the kitsune tales I'm kind of filtering something fun because some of the powers were not abused in one piece as they are not used for attack most likely by that I mean the kitsune ball it has a small white ball and the kitsune just guards the ball and but but vivan isn't really gonna be guarding a ball right look at ren\u00e9e's tails have one two nine tails for most kitsune the number of tails it's usually one but we know devon has nine so that means it's a powerful devil fruit and the more tails to have usually the stronger they are they also can use elemental powers that's pretty self-explanatory a fire river ocean forest mountain thunder celestial which the power of the heavens darkness what this magic that gets you naked oh of course it wouldn't be magic will be enough food but gets you naked cause plates drain life someone creatures of darkness and though even probably wouldn't do that vanishing the shadows time it doesn't allow for time travel the kitsune can freeze time the kitsune music that can control others another form of mind control also the most important thing about what a kitsune can potentially do I know I've been kind of reading that off a site because I couldn't completely I couldn't keep it all in my head but the last thing it has is perfect illusion and perfect illusion is just crazy to a kitsune their illusions are reality what they make for them and for others is as real as anything found or crafted in nature basically what that saying is a kitsune can make a world an illusion so real that they themselves think it's real which means if d-von didn't even have to think it's real if she uses illusions she can just manipulate anything she wants I'm not saying she'll have all of the powers I just listed she could only have one I'm thinking more eluding cuz if she fights Nami Nami uses illusions and she just is able to use a perfect illusion but she can craft anything she wants that is so well crafted that almost anyone would believe it that would just be over powered and she would be one of the strongest female characters we have seen and if the Blackbeard pirate the FRA hat pirates are gonna arrive rise above normal dark oak roots then she could be like as strong as a first hand and Shelley you as strong as an admiral or something or maybe even Chile would be like the aqua level it should be admirable but but probably not since fighting Nami but just the potential afford l coop it's so powerful and I'm actually excited to see what power he has from her CC and being honest if if she could not even fight an army she probably won't but maybe she'll attack Nami and like Santi will be forced to kick a girl to save Nami or not and if that was the case she could very well be the second strongest member her third youngest members black Lea pirates only second to she'll you know and Blackbeard himself so thanks for watching if you draw my content and only feed on my content like this video subscribe and kind of notifications for more one piece content I will see you in the next video

hurting why says working earlier I never was a lot of heavy stuff not my feet hurt my legs for a little bit too but not nearly as bad I think I might need to use up some salt later okay so come for a bit okay tomorrow guys our last day of Lagos someone is gonna get them some milk and cookies and eat this thing well some milk and eat this thing well to someone's well are you gonna try to eat the other one he gets de altar I caddy hours I'll just so good in my up what are you talking I tried you're soaking in milk for five minutes oh no I'm gonna rip it off which I eat it just like before I'll try to eat it first when I don't feel like to go over two lines been through an earthquake once I realized it's very dark in here so turn the other line on for it now yeah John's Jones has been through an earthquake when I switched out the what day was it on that one I don't know I don't remember up here and come back still working on setting up the camera and stuff this is our first time coming in here so trying to get it ready stop moving it yes sponsors please alcohol yeah he's sitting still is it it's okay yeah actually is going to do part of one of them that has to chill and I'm working on another cup of tea yeah my Santa cup okay it's all yours yeah fun Oh God drive us first oh sorry that was my fault not your friend so what do you work in this is for the sugar in the water I'm down the sugar first and on the water it's for this one y'all champagne holiday punch are you gonna get me the recipe so I can yeah put them okay Oh message them to you because I don't know what the links are only mine I know they're on pinterest so I could sure go as if I'm trying to tea with one hand they weren't really focusing in there mix all this stuff together it's not all yet cinnamon sticks three which we have a strainer to you guys I might help you out just drain it when it's done step I put all these things I need for these it's close I got boil all of them and then simmer for 5 minutes ok so there's you want to let her do that because you know you never watch a pot boil and then we'll come back when it's getting to that point [Music] steam yay try not to burn you smells very interesting that smells good okay that's a weird-looking call over to put that in the fridge until it's chilled and then after it's chilled and you're ready to serve it you add the champagne pineapple juice and cranberry juice which we will show you but this has gotta chill first so off to the fridge okay guys this is the other part of our vlogmas day 23 it's not a proper holiday around here if we don't do a drinks video so instead of doing any drinks with you like we would normally do on our channel we're just going to make it part of our block list so we've got it set up in here hope you can see everything really well and ashley is going to talk us through four different holiday drinks and I can't wait I always get a little bit schnockered so this should be fun and interesting so I'll hand it over her hey the first one is pretty simple it's got cinnamon roll cocktail it's one shot a clue three shots of rum chata yeah just in case of needing to mop up something yeah that was pressurized clue and creams one of my favorite drinks I tend to have several favorite cranks but clue and creams one of my favorites off to the side I've got me that's the hot chocolate here and I promise it's not spike because I figure I'm gonna be drinking it out here what works kind of reform I'm excited because tomorrow we have to open our stockings and play some games and some other silly stuff so try to do this without making a mess because our see Shh aren't very good and this one is what's it called again send my mineral  trim a lot smaller somebody will leave it go see her makin a mess shakers I was wondering that the cinnamon part of it if the rum chata had something in it work I don't know because it don't call for fireball usually anything that involves cinnamon calls for fireball I don't know it's a recipe I got off the boat we'll see I don't know who made it boys felt that's Miss Molly okay here we go maybe cuz the clue oh yeah this one's good you don't try it sure so if you like it you can finish mine it's definitely got the warming thing going on which is good for what your nights but it's got like the first taste is kind of off but the aftertaste is very cinnamony hey oh oh i will just put that into my hot chocolate haha oh did you smell this since its cooled first before its most really good hmm wonder that's one last what smells like Christmas this smells like a Christmas scented candle okay not cinnamon roll in some hot chocolate lo haga that's good Joe's new drink yeah the next one is called The Grinch I'm going to start with this because we know how much of this left it calls for Blue Curacao I know red pronunciation everybody says it differently that's how I say it go deal with it love you guys it actually calls for I think three ounces yeah 3 ounces which is three shots we don't have quite that much so don't call for much sprite so about a third of a kid ok so I'll gone to the orange juice hopefully everything fits in here goes be careful when shaking actually carbonation had probably been the thing before then after everything this makes yeah hey don't say how to mix it it just says makes it a large pitcher and stir if you guys mix it this way at home don't put this right in the mixer makes everything else and then mix report in and then pour it your sprite yeah sorry guys I love before she does I love on this bottle right here it says warning flammable I've never seen that quite not a trick I've never had the party 150 on so we'll see how it goes please just do a shot glass shoulda brought some stir sticks em to smells under thinking and it does look very Grinchy hope you guys can see that that will probably make you look like the Grinch afterwards they give all the facial expressions it has more orange juice I'm not sure there's something that I'm not particularly fond though Mike might be the flammable stuff um I taste do you want reduce I don't know we was mostly case like orange maybe use that's like it cooks drink or something well my next this is a little bit different here's first dates more like orange juice than anything waste not want not this one's called chocolate cream pie martini I don't know how it's going to turn out because we have to substitute a couple different things because we don't have vanilla vodka we don't have to die the chocolate look here because that stuff's expensive so and step well creme de cocoa and send a sugar twist so it's kind of vanilla e I guess and who knows it might like our person better absolutely my champagne just hurt me back here oh and I take from shauna you can also add chocolate syrup which we also have some whipped cream and sprinkles HR glass this takes one part of everything and a dash of chocolate syrup and guys she is goes um get me the recipes for these so I can have them for you below that was really hard to say good just feeling it was really sticky realize this how much I have to concentrate on that particular debark about this the shaker I don't made a mess i blame this straight so cart smells good thing no it takes one part I'm shotta one part of the vanilla vodka at one part of the godiva chocolate look here but like I said we don't have the other two things so we said had to substitute it squirted me try to do this without making a mess that's a good sites it sounds good yeah that sounds delicious that's messy it all looks like a chocolate drink like it well I realized it is a chocolate cake but am like sinner than chocolate milk in my head I know what I'd say that's all that matters people and the sun is coming out correctly and our lives i know i probably shouldn't drink this one drink that so ultimately i'll take a cleansing drink to my other alcoholic beverage worker I should get my phone I'll flip the table this smells interesting yes okay OOP that rum shop a little powerful little potent but not bad I'm just praying those last ones delicious because it involves the champagne that I love so it better be good Oh Joel I'm gonna be a happy person this should be interesting because I'm not a sham I shame you're not a champagne fan who's that I am NOT a family name forgive me i am just strong enough to not go poop let me know I bring the lights okay contents under pressure do not shake never use a corkscrew to open I'm not turning it the right way making sure it really stays on there i'ma have the champagne in like three years so I hope it's good whoo that was powerful haha okay we survived Oh Kate the corked here cuz it's pretty yeah throw the pool SS corbel on the bottom I don't know that's the company okay so let me take our print auction right help the children that y'all just saw in the first part of the video yes I had to kill for a little while it's children it smells delicious usually it close this close for regular cranberry juice I don't like cranberry juice is nasty I got kraang grit wait hold on all right now with our contract yes it even recommends the champagne which made me very happy look at the bubbles on top of you this smells really interesting like a little hot what's so interesting let's pray it's really good that was really looking forward to this it's a pretty collar smells of sleep I think that's a mix of the airplane on the cranberries I need to take a burger drink and quite tasty actually like it you know whatever in reminds me of you ever had like the grape juice to the bottle none of them out like the sparkling grape juice oh yeah those things like that yeah I think that's more because the kind of cranberries yeah rip sauce that day your sparkling cider yeah that's good get it out Joe get it out okay was that it yep okay guys know you have that on here in case you ran out of the other orange flavored stuff but yeah oh we can we could've added it to this but um but yeah I don't know what I'm talking about but I sure will be interested Oh we'll just carry on with blog west at the air we on we're on day 23 okay we are almost to Christmas what my hand hurts okay guys I'm going to end today's blog miss here so please make sure to LIKE and subscribe and click the notification bell so you're notified when we upload

couple hours i had to take a nap and sleep it off and how you feel it yeah yeah we don't think the Grinch was was too to our taste but yeah the champagne punch though that was pretty good alright so we will see you tomorrow in the very last blog right dogmas of 2016 so by [Music]", "eWnUZxy8dxM": "[Music] whoa what's going on guys welcome back fart and vaping I am Danny rock and I have just done another video two minutes before so I wanted to get a couple of videos film so I can get them on the channel because I have from some reviews out and I do have a little bit of time to get them filmed forms so the last video was all about sotnik this one is all about candied treats and these liquids London's last week with me they are from ethos vapors I have reviewed their crispy treats range before but these are their candied it is missing one and that's because the bottle exploded everywhere sure these are 120 Miller convert bottles so it's a hundred mil then you put two Nick shots in to make it a 3 milligram 120 mil I do have the peach rings and the fruit bites now if you look at the fort laws one is kind of like skittles and one is kind of like the sugary creamy peach rings in the hairy ball sweets our main focus and focus so a nice quick eliquid review there first of all we're going to go over the fruit bites which is basically like skills I'm going tell you a little bit about the flavor weight get it and all that good jazz so is a 70/30 reassured liquid and I have put two new shots in to make it 3 milligram it's not too sharp it's nice and smooth consume is a bit of a like a sour skittles you flavor you get the the hard candied kind of flavor on the inhale with loads of fruit and on the exhale it just all combines to give you this mouth-watering fruity candy fruit bite that's what they've called it flavor I've been vaping this now for a good few days and on this mesh coil in the geek fave legend it is super tasty if you ever played that game where you took a handful of skills put in your mouth and you weren't allowed to chew on them and you just had to let them melt everything this gives my mouth that after flavor of that it's really strong really fruity and that candy isn't too sweet it does remind me a lot like a skills it's not like a jelly bean where it's very sweet and sugary it's just right and this has been an all-day event on enough with the peat rings and but yeah this flims absolutely amazing and I do love this one a lot you can get these online or in-store I'll put a link in the description where I got them from but that I'll put that in the description like I said next one is the peat rings now this was thought I was most excited for because the peach rings in the Harry Potter classics is my favorite however when I got it and waved it I thought it wasn't a sour it was just full-on beautifulness so oh my my it's not sour but you do get this sugary kind of lip smacking sweetness to it I wish it was sour but it's not it's just really nice and sweet gives me sugar lips when I lick my lips mmm it is good but the peach flavor it's kind of got a little bit of I think it's like an orange to it but the peach is really strong it's absolutely gorgeous the - - the inhale and the exhale together make it full flavored this has been my old over the last two days I did go through the skills and then this so I am swapping between them because they are both amazing and 120 mil isn't really lasting long I am quite a far bit through the bottle now but the range is fantastic the third one that didn't lund cuz the bottle had popped is the jawbreaker that was rather nice add like a chalky bubblegum flavor with a little bit of fruit not so much mint but that kind of after you've been vo number book on flavor and put that one actually I can't review it because I didn't get it but all three will be available on the link I put down below they're 100 mil the retailer 20 pounds $19.99 ish unless there's an offer or a discount cord if there is I'll put it on the description with it but that is basically the ethos the vapors candy treats nice and sweet little review today there I have the skills and the candy peach I wish this would focus quicker there is a lot of light on it however there we go din do ya skills and peat rings the two best sweets that I could have asked for and now available in illiquid it's so good I forgot a buzz off the last video I filmed with the salt Nick which is amazing salt nick is really really good but links for my social media be in the description don't forget to like the video if you've enjoyed it comment if you've tried them or if your going to get them and then let me know if you've tried them subscribe so that I hit that 900 subscribers and I lost put the link to purchase these if you want to try them in the description box too so until next time 510 vaping viewers I will see you next time [Music] [Music]", "60gMiOEpIG0": "hello and welcome to my kitchen Bhavna's\nkitchen today I thought of sharing some of my favorite pineapple rings recipes so let's begin first I'm going to cut\nthe pineapple and just turn upside down to get all the rings out you see nice\nbeautiful rings and so now you can create the recipes using pineapple rings\nyou can make pineapple on pancakes cookies even pineapple upside-down\ncupcakes or the big cake whatever you want to put it using pineapple days to\nprepare pineapple cookies all you need is two ingredients here are your\npineapple rings and chocolate chip which I'm going to melt into the microwave and\nyou can use some interesting topics or your favorite toppings to prepare the\ncookies I'm just going to simply use some coconut to top it up but you can\nuse psychic sprinkles for like a cake same or you can use some nuts ground\nnuts it's up to you into a chocolate chip I have taken a little bit of\ncoconut butter you can now use a regular butter or simply oil even it will work\nwhat it does it makes the chocolate really nice and smooth so ready to go\ninto the microwave for 1 and 1/2 minutes stirring every 30 seconds and look at\nthis creamy nice long melted chocolate ready to deep pineapple rings in it\nfirst I do one side as much as I can look at this well the chocolate still melted Deb some\ncoconut on top yummy and on top of coconut drizzle chocolate like so hmm\nyeah now if desired you can do the other side or you can just leave the side\nwithout topping or even without chocolate next I'm going to make find\nhow about upside-down chocolate mug okay into the microwave\nyes it's going to be great we can easy so let's begin first all dry ingredients\nhere I have 1/2 cup of cake flour you can use plain flour 1/4 cup unsweetened\nhundred percent cocoa powder quarter cup sugar you can add more or less sugar as\nper your preference 1 teaspoon baking powder salt just a pinch twist all dry\ningredients really well alright next wet ingredients here I have quarter cup of\noil and half cup of almond milk you can use dairy or non-dairy milk and here I\nhave vanilla paste vanilla bean paste just a little goes a long way\nmix really well and prepare the lump of free batter and for extra chocolatey flavor I'm\ngoing to add chocolate chips but you can just omit chocolate chip perfect\nso the batter is ready and next I'm going to prepare the holes here I have\nthe bolts that I'm going to use so that you can see clear instead of mugs so I'm\ngoing to show you how exactly I prepare the bowl I'm going to take little butter\nin both of the bowls it's about quarter teaspoon of butter I have and I'm going\nto melt butter into the microwave for 10 seconds alright so there I have butter\nmelted now spread butter all over into the bowl next here I have brown sugar\nwhich I'm going to sprinkle at the bottom of the polls about order teaspoon\nin each Bowl and then spread evenly next here I have pineapple rings which I'm\ngoing to place at the bottom of the bowls and proceeding and ready to knock\nor the better chocolaty better and place the balls onto the tray for\neasy getting in and out of town on microwave so ready to go into the\nmicrowave now the microwaves may vary from one car to the other so just you\ncan read your manual of the microwave how many watts it is I'm going to top\nthis for about two minutes if it's not done you can always set it for more but\nin the beginning you don't want to just put it on too high so okay do not open\nthe microwave immediately just to give like about 510 seconds let cake cool\ninto the bowl first for a little bit about 10 seconds using the butter knife\njust loosen the sides when the cake has cooled down slightly you can try to take\nout the cake just keep the ball inverted until you see that it loosens out from\nthe bowl completely and then carefully lift the bowl just remove the cake away\nfrom the final holes that you see yummy and because it is pineapple upside-down\ncake it has to pass cherry on top I just love to dig into this foodie blue\nchocolate cake with pineapple on top pineapple wings makes great recipes\nfritters even you can make sweet or savory fritters so you can use your\nfavorite pancake batter out here I have 2 cups of flour and baking powder 2 TSP\ngive it a good mix can offer condensed milk 4 tbsp of butter and I have the\nsoftened butter and now first I'm going to beat this butter and condensed milk\nbe on slow speed all right perfect now add 2 tbsp of oil 1 and 2 1 TSP of\nvanilla extract blend again alright and now alternatively I'm going to add\nthis dry flour mix and milk so I'm going to add half of it and I have the warm\nmilk make sure to use to warn milk I'm going to give it a first little stir and\nthen run the blender so that flour doesn't get all over milk you can add as\nmuch milk as you need to adjust the consistency of the better because we\nneed a nice easy to pour kind of flow better\nalright so this batter is ready and you can see that it is very nice smooth and\neasy to pour consistency better here I have a Zi pancake batter which you can\nsee in many of our other videos and here I have the plan heating up and\nIonians ready so just dig pineapple wings into the pancake batter and bake\njust as usual you would bake the pancakes I prefer to slightly butter and\ninto the pancake batter simply dip the whole pineapple ring dip into the batter\nand on the Ducks pan carefully click on the other side carefully smells amazing\nhere when done remove from the pan and bring onto the paper towel\nlook at how yummy it looks and prepare the rest of the pancakes if desired you\ncan just remove the center of the pancake and snack on them and drizzle\nchocolate if desired these pancakes are already sweet but you can again use\nmaple syrup or top it up with some nuts so here I have yummy pancakes ready so\nhope you enjoyed new recipes using pineapple rings I made a pineapple\nupside-down chocolate mug cake you can make pancakes or fritters if you wanna\ngo to

got the dank by pineapple from juggler juice it's a 16 milligram nicotine sample seventy percent PG thirty percent VG hmm I know if you say yeah I get that I do get the pineapple but it's more the core like if you ever had split of pineapple and it's not super super sweet now the core of the pineapple that's so well I mean it's not horrible but I'm gonna give it a three on cuz I and oh what's the word I'm looking for I'll explain myself when I expect pineapple I expect a sweet semi sugary kind of a flavor and to me you ever cut a pineapple and you get the core part and just eat the core it's kind of more bland and out of sweet and that's and that's the flavor I kind of get it's like pineapple core huh I'm gonna go with a fourth what pineapple flavor it's not a sweet definitely is you know a fully ripe pineapple this is more of like and write a couple drops fell maybe I'll change it but for right now is a three-tailed tripping all over me are you dripping it what are you doing over there folks he's a control all right um it it doesn't taste like you know sweet pineapple from a can and not mean you know process pineapple this tastes like okay now i'm getting a little bit more it's like I just didn't have enough it's like a minute epic go for it's like a brought pineapple that I would have just cut just yeah but that it still has that core flavor it's not it's not super sweet it's dates there's no sugary taste doing if it was sweeter I'd probably or more like a ripe pineapple I'd give it a read but it's a four I mean I like that ripe pineapple flavor maybe that's that's time trying to say take it from the whole line I am kama aina hey who's a Hawaiian me a little Hawaii baby from what my mother's side oh I don't look at Hanworth exactly people don't Irish at Hawaii Oh live without life-size it's an odd mix I know anyway it's a four-way production hmm three maybe a 4-3 for me okay I'll go to throw hit one and that's a yeah pineapple from juco juice put enough on your addy to make it make it go yeah Oh", "cttYRHEJX5k": "so I've got a bit of a confession to make I'm not much of a cook and that being said I'm actually doing something for the first time that I have never done before so I got this slow cooker for like 50 bucks or so and I actually used it one time one time that's all I did I got it specifically to make some slow cooker chicken little soup but right now I have a I have a roast cook in I've never made a roast before I've never made a roast in a slow cooker and a broiler or however else people make roast I've never done it and I just can't it it felt like using the slow cooker cuz wow that got rate really quick I kind of just felt like using a slow cooker because what one I have it and don't do anything with it it was literally just collecting dust on the top shelf of that little white shelving unit that's sitting right in front of my kitchen door and - I kind of wanted to learn something new so I figured that would be an easy way to start cuz I don't have to do much I just cut up a bunch of potatoes and carrots and onion and do some garlic salt in there I got a two pound roast chucked it all in there and poured some beef broth over and I called it a day so I've learned something new and I'm getting to use that so I'm gonna keep you guys post about how that turns out I really I don't feel like it's gonna be so good um I mean I've got another I think like three and a half hours three hours 40 minutes or so based on the clock but there's something that I would like to try and earlier today let me actually pull it up here I'm sorry I just need to own the momento I was scrolling on Facebook while I was at work and what I had found is a post that says while women are scamming these faithful men dipping a pregnancy test in apple juice will turn it positive you're welcome fellas these birds are getting smart save a brother's life today and it's accompanied with a picture of this which is a pregnancy test and some apple juice I'm not sure if there's any can you find my face hi I'm not sure if there's any truth behind this but I feel like instead of just looking it up I'm going to go down I'm going to get a cheap pregnancy test and I'm going to get the exact same one in this picture and I'm gonna try to find that same brand of apple juice and I'm going to test this for myself we're going to see if we can't get a positive pregnancy test based off of apple juice hey don't see the brand that there should have been that they used in the Facebook ting so F thing just something with a hundred percent apple juice right let's get some good stuff so I can drink it afterwards possibly you want apple juice okay I don't like apple juice too much either let's just get some cheap then there's two forty eight to forty eight dollar ninety seven I like the looks of that yeah great value apple juice now to go find a pregnancy test alright I have returned home we have I just hit myself in the eye with the apple juice I have gotten the exact same pregnancy test that they showed on the Facebook post as well as first signal it's a really cheap pregnancy test it was 88 cents and then I also got a Butterfinger racemic Fleury nut butter fingers Teresa McFlurry so this is unrelated but it's delicious and I wanted to brag so I'm going to test this out I've never taken a pregnancy test before so I'm eager to find out if I'm if I'm pregnant or not don't really know how to do it suppose there's instructions for that purpose I'm gonna take these I would report my findings in like 20 seconds but also my girlfriend and I we we ate the roast and it was delicious it was like the best dinner I've had in a long time it was awesome I don't know what Lucky Nugget I found wherever but it was very very good and I'm super pleased I just wish it didn't take four hours to do such a thing alright so the first response actually came with two tests and the 88 cent one surprise came with one and one thing I would like to mention is they really did bogus with the 88 cent test the instructions were all in Spanish like even the box was in Spanish I didn't notice it at the store but the only Spanish test that they had apparently was an 88 cent test I feel like that's kind of ridiculous and have it be that cheap but we got our [ __ ] juice and the first response it says that you have to dip it for five seconds and then wait three minutes and for the whatever this one was called home pregnancy test device which I'm sure that's not the name of it but that one said it comes with like a dropper and you use three drops into the little tray and then wait three to four minutes so we got four minutes and a three minutes which give me a proper hey science that's why it is science not real piss it's fine guys I'm not playing with piss on my counter what is this do not eat oh no boom yeah so we got this guy and hey dude do the focus job focus focus do it do it okay so right there is where I put the drops and then two lines on either of them means pregnant one line on either of them means not pregnant so these two need five seconds boom and dip one two three oh five good to go I can set these guys down I don't want them dripping apple juice all over my counters so we don't set them right there and now we get this guy justice doo doo doo doo doo focus do it do it do it do it and one and knit two and three right down into the little suck guy here with us next to it so now we will wait for these three info minute tests and figure out if we bring in that I don't think we will be little evil we have done the test we have focus focus all right all right we have not pregnant not pregnant and not pregnant we have busted this little myth you cannot get pregnant with apple juice all right so for those of you they did not know Jackie actually moved to a new house and she just texted me and asked me like if I wanted to come over blah blah blah blah blah and I have plans tonight so I told her I couldn't and then she responded with that she was just like a little bit lonely and like I can tell she's bummed out so I have maybe like an hour and a half before my plans so I'm actually going to head over and check out a new place because I have been over there but not since she moved in like I was in there to help clean stuff up a little bit but I haven't actually seen it since she moved in so I'm gonna head over there and I'm going to take her a delicious treat from my workplace and we're going to see what exactly is going on hi oh so that just happened um that was not even 30 seconds after I put the camera down like I actually saw that guy pull out as I was putting my camera down and shutting it off and everything and apparently I have no front license plate which I knew about because my front bracket came off and apparently also I have this cool thing where my my license has been expired for three months I had no idea they stopped sending out the little notifications and everything in the mail like you don't get those anymore in the United States I don't know how they do in other countries but they completely got rid of that to save money so I had no idea that I was even expired or close to expired so I'm gonna have to go down to do that tomorrow good thing I actually work right in front of the DMV so I can just run down there while I'm at work or something and take care of that but this is just this is my luck you know I just I can't get away from police no matter what I do I have no idea why they're just attracted to me I mean thankfully he gave me a warning not to take it but still the fact that I got pulled over anyway when I'm I'm short on time trying to rush to Jackie's house it's just kinda that's a big bummer we hear she lives on a little farm area her family all I dropped my wallet for family uh owns this farm and they rent out like all crabber ha she uh she has this beautiful farm like on credit boom ok ok look at this look at this oh yeah oh yeah her neighbors are all family so they actually own like this whole area Hey oh [ __ ] out of the door living on a farm you are the only yeah thank you lonely oh this storm is insane right now oh my god that is so kick-ass oh it's like right there - the whole thing is like right there the skies turning red you can't tell from the camera but it's like bright red right now holy crap oh I love it so much storms are by far my favorite thing oh wow that added a bunch of flicker to this innit oh man okay I should probably go inside yeah yeah I'm going inside well I'm back home now oh my god was here probably about two hours or so something like that it's kind of boring over at her house right now because she doesn't have TV or radio or anything like that over there she's just barely moving in so she doesn't have anything set up it's even like I didn't bother recording over there with her because she doesn't really have the best lighting in her house yet either she doesn't have white the lamps that she would need she just has like these really old really warm colored lights so I didn't try doing any of that there but I'm home I am on my computer I just got this started up as well as this guy here on my lap and I'm getting ready to start pulling this stuff off of my cameras and start getting the editing try to get this up to you tomorrow which will be the 19 and I have to use my laptop for it now because with with the new case that guy it only has the the two Drive bays in the front and then um I had a happy yet I guess that doesn't matter that's not where I was going with that that has nothing to do with it I don't know why I brought that up I'm tired okay I've slept probably about four hours to past six days in a row but um my motherboard only has three USB headers on it and that leaves me with like the i/o panel on the top my fan controller and my LED RGB controller so I don't really have room to include this guy I had to pull him out that is my my card reader and pull that out don't have room for it anymore so now I have to use the card reader on my laptop and then send it over the internet to my computer from here which is actually relatively quick once I put it up to I'm sorry that's bad framing once I put it up to the ethernet cord and everything so it gets done but this is just a roundabout way I got to do it but I'm going to get to it so thank you guys so very very much for watching you know love appreciate every single one of you and I will see you guys in the next one", "95LWbWsJdtg": "don't go inside the bank what's inside the

got the figure citrus craft vape cartridge again we are rockin through the stuff that came in from BC guys I'm really excited to tap into this and try it out we're gonna get the intro running and through here for you guys first and then we're gonna tap into this vape so see you guys on the other side of the intro when we got a little bit more information and we actually start being able to try this babe you'll see on the other side [Music] welcome back you guys so start things off we've got the citrus craft vape cartridge from figure I only picked up the 0.25 grammar because that's all they have in stock at the store I definitely would have preferred half gram cartridge but the quarter gram is all we've got for today so this little sucker came in at 70 percent THC with 0.1 percent CBD and the one cool thing on here that I know it's right at the bottom it gives you the option to trace like to track your packaging with a lot number so I did do that I went into the figure website and pulled it up you can actually enter the number in there and it'll pull up all of the information and the certificate of analysis on the but it'll give you the pesticides amount like it figure gives you a huge amount of transparent information that I have not seen from any other company so huge shadow to figure for that I got a couple of packs of their pre girls that are in my golf bag as well thinking about doing a little bit of a review on those with this I definitely think I might be pulling those payrolls up and out set you guys can see what what the the tracer products looks like with those cuz I think it'd be better to do a separate video there cuz today we're gonna be reviewing this vape cartridge gel so let's go back and read off a little bit of information that they do have about the cartridges so they're in a glass chamber with a ceramic heating element to deliver a high quality vape every time the best of figure made flexible our craft cartridges are compatible with any standard 510 thread vape battery figure quality without vitamin E acetate it's available in three all-natural flavors so that being the citrus natural terpene and then the mixed berry so overall they don't have anything else for the for the citrus faith yeah and actually so we're gonna crack open this container and see what these point to five cartridges look like so let's break that seal pull this open and take our first looks of this cartridge II guess so squeezy oh that bottom ones giving me trouble today there we go just like that this is a container you have a little bit excessive but it is better than some of the other ones so first it'll look at this I really do like that mouthpiece on there that that color as well it alternates you guys can take a little bit of a better look let's see if this ooh the t-shi sticker comes off nice and easy it looks like you guys might to get you really there we go do something we'll pull a THC sticker off and give you guys a better look at the actual concentrate in the cartridge later it's got a really nice sharp orange color to it I'm really interested in trying this out so figure does use 1/2 gram cartridges but when you got a quarter of a gram in there that sucker looks half-full already huh we're gonna start off with the fire side battery I'm pretty sure yep we've got our set on the white marker so we're gonna pull this little plastic stopper off slide this on and we'll take our first looks and taste that actually looks pretty nice with that gold battery on there the gold and silver match up really well but enough talking let's actually take this skirt for it first rip see how it tastes you guys we start out on the light temp we're gonna move up to medium temperature and then the high before you slide over and do the same thing through a G pen and then I got a couple of rigs here and the hemp ER adapter we're gonna be taking a couple of rips through the rig's as well and I'll be able to give you guys an overall and just an honest opinion what I think of how this bud did their concentrate their vape whatever you want to call it but we've done enough talking you guys let's actually get into this and try it out Cheers really easy to draw through okay guys so I guess said it was really surprisingly easy to draw through this is honestly one of the best drawing cartridges that I've experienced yet Wow I was not expecting that through the first one but I'm getting a almost kind of fruit loop flavor with this with this tip and it's surprisingly it's catching me a little off-guard but all in all I'm really enjoying it you guys so we're gonna go ahead and take another taste of this at the blue temperature that medium voltage and see if it changes it at all but if it's that fruit loop flavor all the way through you guys this one's gonna do quite well I suspect Cheers so I'm not medium you get less of the citrus more of the type of cereal flavor that you get almost more of like a honey kind of flavor it's not bad by any means it's not turning me away but the lower temperatures definitely had the more citrus flavor that I was enjoying and expecting but we got the sucker cranked all the way up to the red the high temp we're gonna try it out there and see how it does at that temperature you guys Cheers does have a really nice flavor on that high temp but it definitely leans more towards that honey flavor it's got a little bit more citrus in the medium but not by much at all actually it's um definitely the low temp is the more enjoyable temp on that fire side battery but I've got the cookie G pen here we're gonna take it through there see how it tastes on this cuz I have a feeling that this G pen they're gonna push her a little bit better flavor you guys but only way to know is if we actually try it out and let's go ahead and do that Cheers definitely different flavor less of that kind of weedy cereal experience with the G pen I'm finding a lot more like gummy kind of flavor and it's it's enjoyable it's nice and light but still very enjoyable so we've bumped it up to the second temperature I want to see if it keep pushes through that way or if it ends up going more that honey route like it did through the fireside pan you guys see on the other side so it doesn't go more honey but it does subtle the citrus flavor down quite a bit it's definitely one of those baits that you want to keep tapping through on the lower temperature I'm thinking these higher temps I find you're just burning through the terpenes a lot quicker than you'd actually be able to enjoy them and that's that's a big disappointment you guys so we've got a bumped up to the highest side we're gonna take one last rip through just the Pens and see how it does on here but honestly I'm not I'm not expecting much at the higher temp you guys the lower seem to be the better flavor saver but let's go ahead and take it through its last trip from the pen Cheers yeah it definitely just goes relatively bland and it's very disappointing that way so next step is to take this sucker through some rips from the bomb so let's hope that this adapter is gonna want to work with us today get it into the rig so it stays there but well uh we'll have to see I got a bump down to the lowest temperature we're gonna start out through this little mini rig here very little water and then we'll pick it through our 420 cata box rig because that one just allows a little bit more of the perk the percolation with the showerhead perk in there or this one's just a straight down stem right into the water so let's see how this vape does on the lowest tap through here th ow okay so it had not really much flavor there I found it was really mild and a little bit disappointing but we've got the second level on the battery just taken through a rip through here and see see if it improves the taste at all you guys Cheers hmm it does get more of that wheat you taste wheat he tastes not weedy tastes but wheat he tastes and it's not bad it's still enjoyable but it's it's missing something I think but we've got to bumped up to the highest level it's taken taste through there and see see the extra temperature helps at all I don't know I guess let's uh let's try it out Cheers no nobody more we'ii taste wheat taste hey guys so we've got the other rig we're gonna go ahead and preheat the G pen this time and give it a little chance so we can really take a fat rip let's try it out y'all Cheers back at the lowest tab definitely more citrus I I'm gonna recommend this lowest temperature you guys definitely the best okay so we bump this up to the second temperature we're gonna try it out through there you guys and see see how it does but honestly I'm not expecting very much Cheers okay yes so it did have that weedy taste again that wheat II taste but we got this pen pre-charge with the hottest temp to take for a rip and see how it does you're here cheers y'all honestly my biggest fan of this cartridge you guys that was actually disappointing it it really is only one of those ones that you can set bond once or twice doesn't really hit that hard kind of lead you in a citrus direction but by no means takes a strong flavour and like hit you with it it is very disappointing that way I definitely wish it had more flavor you guys that's just gonna be honest review them I wish this had more flavor but going into the high it does have a nice light mental drift to it where lay the the back your mind is kind of loosely swinging in the wind where you can be focused on something but you've got that little voice in the back your head kind of thing and that's really what I'm finding with this where it's I'm like oh I need to get this done but [ __ ] like that right like just don't enjoy yourself kind of a kind of a high and it's it's nice I definitely do like that it's something that would be very helpful if I am golfing or am doing something that has that that focus but if something that the frustration because of the focus is there that's the better way to describe it the frustration because of the focus on the game such as golf because if you make a mistake it is frustrating especially when I'm at the point where I'm kind of that verge of a beginner intermediate I'm right on that bubble once I can roll over into the intermediate I've got more consistency that's and that's where the biggest thing now is consistency and the frustration that comes with that being inconsistent that is and that's the thing with this cartridge kind of circles back the flavor was very inconsistent it's frustrating I'm wholly gonna give it a 6 out of a 10 you guys just because the high has that enjoyment but it's not strong enough to really blow me away and give make me want to smoke that over some of the other sativa strains that I have that have that mental drift in effect and I'd rather just smoke a lighter amount of that because I enjoyed the flavor more and that's really gonna be the difference between this this cartridge getting a six or anything higher that six marker is you've got some good qualities but I've got lots of [ __ ] that I'd smoke above you and I've got lots of cartridges actually that I would smoke above this one to get this type of effects you guys but we're gonna wrap this one up I I wish it did better I really did I thought it would have citrus strains usually hit home with me I'm a big citrus that uplift I really do like that kind of flavor I just thought it would do better but it didn't end up doing that I'm a little bit disappointed we're are gonna do one more riff through this little rig because I feel like we should give it another big rip to give it a chance to try and bump it up but I really don't think I will YouTube stick around cuz after this last trip it'll be your guy's end card but for everyone else I really do hope you guys enjoyed I'll be back tomorrow with some orange cookies review from gage cannabis we got the last BC bud of the week from our take me home 2022 uh a trip but if you got some orange cookie sativa dominant hybrid here that I'm really looking forward to getting into

baffle from a number-10 can and steel duct pipe hi it's Jeff with a backyard Birds channel I've been providing nest boxes for native birds since 2012 and want to share with you what I've learned my nest boxes were safe from raccoons and cats because they were mounted on 10-foot telescoping poles made of EMT conduit but predators like squirrels and snakes were able to climb the poles to reach my nest boxes after experimenting I found the best solution was the can duct pipe baffle combined with the 10-foot telescoping pole once I added the baffle to the pole I no longer had a problem with climbing predators to see how to make a telescoping pole though the baffle hangs on follow the link at the top of the video for more videos like this you may want to subscribe to my channel let's look at the materials we need to create the baffle an empty number 10 can with the label removed is used for the top of the baffle a number 10 can is about seven inches tall and six inches in diameter you can find these at school cafeterias or other places that make large quantities of food a 24 inch long 6-inch round steel duct pipe made of 30 caged sheet metal is used for the body of the baffle to number 10 half-inch sheet metal screws are used to attach the can to the pipe a conduit hanger is attached to the pole and supports the baffle look for links to the materials in the video description let's cover the tools we need to make the baffle a 1/8 inch titanium drill bit is needed to drill through the cannon pipe a prick punch is used to poke holes in the can a rubber mallet is used to hit the bunch a handheld drill is used for drilling the holes a 1-inch board about 12 inches long is used as a brace when punching the holes a one and a quarter inch thin wall hole saw is used to cut a hole in the top of the can a ruler and permanent marker are used to mark the cam for the holes a shot magnet is used to pick up metal shade means from cutting the whole links to the tools can be found in the video description to fasten the duct pipe to the can we need to make two small holes in the can before we start remove the label from the can to make a guide hole for the drill bit we use the prick punch to punch a hole in the can we need a wooden brace place the one-inch board in a vise with about eight inches sticking out mark the can about three-quarters of an inch from the end with the marker place another mark on the opposite side of the can three quarters of an inch from the end slide the can onto the board and rotate it so one mark lies above the board to punch a hole in the can place the tip of the punch on the mark and tap it with the mallet turn the can to the opposite side and punch another hole to make the holes the correct diameter for the sheet metal screws drill out the holes with a 1/8 inch titanium drill bit the can is now ready to have a hole drilled in its top to make the hole in the top of the can we use the metal hole saw a hole is punched in the center of the can is a guide for the hole saw hold the can with your feet place the drill bit on the guide hole and slowly drill the hole through the can empty the metal shavings from the can onto the ground place a plastic bag over the magnet and pick up the middle shavings the bag along with the shavings can be removed from the magnet and thrown away the can is now ready to be attached to the duct pipe to assemble the baffle snap the ends of the duct pipe together slide the can over the top of the pipe line up the drill bit in one of the holes in the can and drill a hole through the pipe place a sheet metal screw in the hole screwing it down tight turn the baffle over drill the other hole through the pipe and fasten with a screw the baffle is now complete and ready to be hung on the pole to hang the baffle on a pole we use a conduit hanger use a three-quarter inch or a one-inch conduit hanger depending on the size of the conduit place the conduit hanger on the conduit pull and tighten slip the baffle over the conduit so that it hangs on the conduit hanger with the baffle in place climbing predators will not be able reach the nest box let me share with you how I use the baffles I use a number 10 can by itself on all of my poles to prevent squirrels from destroying the nest boxes but when birds begin nesting in a nest box I remove the can and replace it with the can duct pipe baffle since I started using the baffle climbing predators have not been a problem with my nest boxes I've also used it on poles with bird feeders I hope this baffle helps you prevent climbing predators from reaching your nest boxes hi I'm Jeff with the backyard Birds channel if you like this video and want to see more like it you may want to subscribe to my channel just click the red

got another two-for-one review to bring you guys today and this is gonna be on a flavor to flavors and a lot of people have nothing but great things to say about and a lot of you guys and girls have been requesting me to review this for a while now so for months I've been getting requests please do review on chubby bubble so here it is guys I got the chubby bubble purp which has been you know talked about by a lot of different people telling me to do a review on this I also got the blue rats I'm a big fan of the bluegrass flavors so I was happy to get my hands on this one as well alright so let's not waste any time let's go get it [Music] [Applause] [Music] alright guys so the Shelby bubble purp and the chubby bubble blue razz were both sent over to me from Andy at Aspen Valley babes for purpose in this review that of course will not change my thoughts or opinions on either of these two e liquids so yeah like I stated first for a while now for a couple months a lot of people have been requesting that I do review on chubby bubbly liquids especially the chubby bubble perf so even though it's been out for a while it's not a Nui link but I still wanted to go ahead and show you guys and I do listen all the comments and then I do like to uh you know communicate with you guys and give you guys what you want so I knew you were looking for a chubby bubble review I was able to get my hands on it and now I'm gonna bring it to you so a lot of people keep saying how the chubby bubble perk tastes exactly like hubba bubba bubble gum which i was a huge fan of when i was a kid so far if you guys watch a lot of my reviews you know that the best grape flavor that i've had yet to date and i still stand by this and of course it's gonna be subjective but it's definitely gonna be the grape big-league juice right here I just absolutely love to see liquid steel my favorite to this day probably one of my top eliquid of all time to be hundred percent honest with you and the great thing about this they finally change over two labels which I think was a fantastic idea I'm sure you can see why I think that was a good idea but they did change your labels around I'll put the link down for great big league juices or for big league juices and you can go on there and check out all the different flavors that they had to offer if you're interested I'm also gonna put a link down for Aspen Valley baby I'm gonna review so if you want to get the chubby bubble purp or if you want to check out some other other flavors you can go ahead and do that and I will give you a 25% off coupon code as well underneath in the description all right so let's get down to it guys we're gonna vape on it first people on the chubby bubble purp first and then we'll move over to the blue rats at the end of the answer we're done wrapping up the chubby bubble purp all right so it's 70/30 VG PG comes in a zero three six milligrams nicotine 60 ml glass dropper bottle 1899 now they also have 120 ml bottle as well they do have 120 ml gorilla bottle they don't have all the flavors from the chubby bubble lineup but they do have the great the purp and a couple of the other flavors and the 120 mils going for $28.99 I believe so you can go check that out as well alright so here's the bottle we've got the big old bubble on the front there with the grapes on the bottom says 70/30 VG PG here on the side gives you all the warnings everything else on the back it is manufactured by mod fuel I'm a big fan of the mod feely liquids I think they do a fantastic job alright so we're gonna open it up guys we're gonna smell it I'll let you when I get from the smell then we're gonna be born we're gonna go to vapor production we'll go over to throat hit we'll go over to flavor on both the inhale the exhale you know if it's an all-day babe for me if of course I recommend it to you why why I wonder why I would not go out and purchase this and that's gonna be actually gonna switch over to the big baby beast - I do have it loaded up in there so I'll give you guys my opinions from both the tank and the RDA and then once we're done we'll move on to the blue wrasse now I'm not gonna tell you at the end which one I prefer more whether it's the chubby bubble purp or the great big League juices for one main reason only pretty soon we're gonna start doing a battle of the juices and grape that's gonna be one of the flavors that we're gonna have a battle with so I'm gonna have the big-league juice up against the chubby bubble purp up against the grey part candy and then we're gonna figure out during that review which one I like most it'll give you guys all my thoughts and opinions during that review but I don't want to give it away yet so I'm not gonna tell you which one I prefer more at the end but I will let you know my thoughts on this of course all right so let's go ahead open it up actually you know I don't even need to open it up I can already smell right through the bottle and what everybody's been telling me that is that it tastes like grape Hubba Bubba I don't know how many times I'm gonna be able to say Hubba Bubba before I start laying fingers that's such a funny word but I don't know how many times people have told me that it takes like grape Hubba Bubba so many people have told me that so it actually it smells upon a percent like grape Hubba Bubba bubblegum so smell I'm gonna give it a solid eh I don't know if I mentioned it but we are gonna grade each category a being the best at being the worst so I'm gonna get the smell definitely gonna get an egg it smells fantastic um let's go eh guys babe oh and I got a sitting on the cosmonaut 24 millimeter Rd I get a single-coil fuse Clapton stainless steel build and it's a big old coil guys went out of 0.1 6 ohms 65 watts let's have a baby it's it's definitely good let me just say that it is absolutely fantastic so throw it on a scale of minimal to hard it's absolutely non-existent very smooth on both the inhale the XL you're not gonna get a throaty from this at all not harsh at all all right so vapor production let's go into a couple more and then we'll talk about the vapor even out the nostrils guys very smooth no burning sensation so vapor production first seventy thirty it's Chuck in the clouds and that's a single coil build so if anybody tells you you can't get big clouds off a single coil they're wrong check it out alright so the vapor production is definitely gonna get a solid D it's doing what a 70 30 s expected to do so now let's go ahead and touch on the flavor so on the inhale I'm absolutely picking up on that grape hubbub of a bubble gum and on the exhale I pick up on the same exact flavor it's so consistent on both the inhale the exhale all the way through it's very consistent doesn't really change up in flavor at all now I am gonna be honest in the beginning when I first started vaping on the chubby bubble before the review about two days ago I wasn't a fan I must have I had a different build at the time I had you know I I didn't really put any four I'll be honest I didn't put any fresh cotton and so I was trying to burn off the old flavor that I was using and I was getting more of like a grape pixie stick flavor and it just it wasn't bad but it wasn't my thing I wasn't blown away you know I was thinking automatically damn everybody told me this tastes like grape Hubba Bubba and I'm just getting like a great pixie stick like a sweet great pixie stick and it wasn't bad like I said but it wasn't something that I was thrilled with now that I've changed my build now that I put some fresh cotton in and I've been vaping it out of the big baby and a fresh coil I can tell you now the flavor absolutely has changed I'm picking up on that grape Hubba Bubba all the way 100% so I'm just gonna say it right now flavor gets an a it's fantastic I can I can definitely make this all day no question in my mind a lot of times I'll say you know maybe that would change in a few days this isn't gonna change this flavor is fantastic it's I'm not gonna give it away but I feel so far the same I feel pretty much so far the same as I did with the big league juicer so I know I can make this all day long alright so why I would recommend why I would would I recommend it to you I'm sorry yes I would absolutely I would recommend it to you because it's a fantastic great bubblegum flavor and it's not too heavy on that bubblegum you get a slight bubble gum on the exhale but more or less you get that nice sweet crepe olney now let me go ahead do another one so if you're into the great flavours then obviously I really think you're going to enjoy this one but if grape is not the flavor for you if you don't like to create candy flavors it's not gonna be your it's not gonna it's not gonna be one for you you're not gonna enjoy it but there's plenty of other chubby bubble flavors that you may enjoy alright so I would definitely recommend it to you why I will go out and buy this or why would not i absolutely would number one 60 mils 1899 I think that's a very fair price plus you get the 25% off number two it's definitely an all day vape I conveyed this all day it's not only it's nice it's sweet it's almost like it's refreshing it's just great guys summertime I think it makes it that much better that much more enticing because it is summer it just has that taste to it it's fantastic it really brings you back to your childhood chewing on that hubbub of chewing gum and it's just absolutely a beautiful beautiful flavor so we're gonna go ahead and move onto got big baby beast I'll gonna let you guys know if I get the same flavor out of the big baby as I do from the cosmonaut RDA let's go ahead and check that out alright guys so we got the chubby bubble purp loaded up here in the big baby beast I gotta sit in at 57 watts let's have a baby as you can see the vapor production is still pumping out the vapor out of the tank it's absolutely doing one to 1730's expect to do out of the tank so it's gonna get a solid B for the vapor production with the big baby beast as well as it did with the cosmonaut umm flavor lets us get ready every to its throat hit let me just get that out of the way again non-existent I'm still not getting any throat it just to smooth out of the tank as it was out of the RDA so flavor on the inhale definitely picking up on that hubba bubba gum on the exhale also picking up on that hub of bubble gum more or less get that great flavor on the inhale followed up with a hint of that bubble gum on the exhale and what I love about this flavor it's not overpowering with that bubble gum flavor like so many of those bubble gum I liquids are a lot of them just tastes like that original bubble tape and they're just sweet and and it just gets to be too much this has that nice little hint of bubblegum on the exhale and just that nice sweet perfect balance of that grape all throughout the entire vape so yeah even out of the tank guys it's gonna put out immaculate flavor its wicking like a charm let's do another one which one do I prefer whether it's out rather the tank do I prefer the tank or the RDA um you know what for this one I'm gonna say I'm gonna go with the tank I'm actually gonna go to the tank on this one I feel like it's just wicks beautifully in here it's just it's a really nice sweet flavor it's not really much different from the RDA so the reason I'm gonna give it to the tank is because I can drive around with this and be content all day long I could fill the tank go out with it not to worry about keep dripping normally I feel like a lot of the flavors are more intense when you vape them out of an RDA but as far as the chubby bubble goes I'm pretty much picking up on the same flavors maybe just a tad bit tone down in the tank here but I'm really enjoying this one out of a tank so I'm gonna give it to the tank I usually don't give the the advantage to the tank when I do these reviews when I'm comparing both RDA and tank but for this one I'm gonna give it to the big baby beasts I'm really enjoying it don't get me wrong I enjoy it out of the RDA as well I think it's fantastic got a either but I'm gonna give the little advantage to the tank on this I feel like it's winking perfect putting out awesome flavor and it's just all-around an excellent excellent V puttin out plenty of vapor alright so make sure you guys check this out if you're into the great flavors I highly recommend it you guys were a hundred percent accurate with this definitely tastes like hubba bubba so thank you so much for i recommending this one i thoroughly enjoyed it so let's go ahead guys we'll move on to the chubby bubble blue razz and we'll see what that one's all about alright guys so here we got the chubby bubble blue razz and as you can see it looks the same as the chubby bubble purp except for our grapes it's got blue raspberries on the front there but it's got the bubble it's a 70/30 VG PG just like the chubby bubble purp was so we're gonna go ahead and go over all the same aspects with the blue rads as we did with the purp and then at the end I'll let you know which one I prefer alright so let's go ahead and smell it again I'd only have to open this I could smell a tree from the bottle so you definitely get that nice sweet blue raspberry smell coming from it to be honestly it smells like a lot of other blue raspberr flavors I had such as the bluegrass hard candy it smells a lot like the blue razz emoji e-liquid thats our belts e-liquid so it has that similar smell to it so I'm gonna go ahead and give this smell of solid B it's not quite not quite an a it doesn't quite get the same grade as the chubby bubble purp did but it still smells fantastic so I'll go ahead and give it a B alright so I got it sitting on the cosmonaut RDA here I put a fresh piece of cotton in there same build everything else I'm not gonna bother vaping it out of the big baby beast that's obvious that it's gonna wick just as good as a chubby ball purp did and it's gonna taste just the same out of the tank as it does out of the RDA here that's what I'm gonna assume anyway so we'll just stick with the cosmonaut alright let's go to vape 65 watts here we go and you guys know I'm a sucker for blue razz flavors absolutely love them I reviewed a lot of bluegrass flavors in the past so I was I was more excited about this one than I honestly then I was about the chubby bubble purp let's go into a couple more throwing it on the scallop minimal cannot exist and it's absolutely minimal same smooth throat hit on both inhale in the exhales I got from the chubby bubble perb vapor production as you can see for a 70/30 it's Chuck in the vapor vapors vapor production gonna get a solid B just like the chubby bubble part dead alright so flavor we're gonna go to people in a little bit more then we're gonna touch on flavor notes even out the nostrils just like the perp no burning sensation very very smooth so flavor alright so on the inhale definitely picking up on that uh that blue rasli it's almost like a it reminds me more or less like a blue R as a judge bluegrass Jolly Rancher like a blue raspberry hard candy and you get a small minut hint of bubble gum all in the exhale I pick up a little bit more on the bubble gum out of the eye of the perp more or less than I did of the chubby bubble blue rat so I'm gonna go ahead right now and just say it before I even get to the end I'm liking this one but I did but I do prefer the purp over the blue res which is surprising I thought I was gonna really like the blue raspberry more but I'll be 100% honest with you guys it kind of just tastes similar to a lot of other blue raspberry flavors that I've had it tasted pretty much similar to the blue razz hard candy it kind of tastes a little sim - the blue razz emoji I'm not gonna tell you which one I like more because again I'm gonna eventually do a Battle of the bluegrass flavors as well and you'll find out then which one I prefer the most but it has those similarities between all those different blue Razzie liquids so there's not much in this one that I'll say that differentiates itself between the rest of them it's kind of just got that similar taste but I'm gonna give the I'm gonna give this taste this I'm gonna give the flavor is solid well go ahead and give it a solid b-plus it's definitely right there I can vape it all day absolutely it's a good blue razz flavor but there's not really much like I had stated that's on putting this in a class all by itself compared to some of the other bluegrass flavors because they kind of all just have that similar taste behind it in my opinion anyway so yeah I like it do I like it more than the chubby bubble purp no I do prefer the chubby bubble purp more but it's definitely an all day vape I could easily vape this all day long so what I recommend it to you of course I would have you're in the bluegrass flavors and if you're looking for a nice blue raspberry candy type flavor more or less like a blue raspberry hard candy I don't get too much of the Bubblegum from this and that and that's subjective maybe you guys pick up a little bit more on that bubblegum but I'm more or less just get like a nice sweet blue raspberry candy from this flavor okay now I did make this out of a tank a long time ago somebody let me try it out of their tank and it was enjoyable then - I couldn't remember exactly what it tastes like but it did taste good out of the tank I do remember that much so yeah guys I mean I would go out and purchase a number one like I said 60 mils 1899 plus you get the 25% off you can't beat that number - it's a good blue RESP waiver if you're looking for a nice good blue razzle de f\u00eate you're gonna get it from this if you're not looking for like that sour Bell blue razzing you're looking just more for like that blue raspberry candy that's what you're gonna get from this one so the emoji e-liquids it kind of has the similar taste to it but it doesn't have that sour kick to it like the emoji did and that's another blue rose flavor I'm gonna recommend to you guys I haven't had it in a long time but emoji blue raspberry was really good so they also got that Alaska value babes as well so if you're not in the bluegrass flavors obviously it's not gonna be the one for you you definitely are gonna pick up on that sweet blue raspberry candy so check out some of the other flavors but that's it guys so I'm gonna give the manager - chubby bubble perk darkness when I absolutely think that the chubby bubble perp just it just stood out more to me it just had it had a lot it had better flavor in my opinion even though there are two different flavors I enjoy the hubbub of flavor I was getting from it along with that slinky in a bubble gum on the exhale and on this one I'm enjoying that nice sweet blue raspberry flavor but I'm not picking up too much on the bubble gum and it is a bubble gum flavor so you should be getting more of that still fantastic though still would definitely recommend it but that's it for this one guys don't forget to Like comment and please subscribe hopefully I earn your subscription and guys we're gonna be doing that uh battle that all of the juices soon so if you guys have any ideas if you guys have any juices you would like to see me do a battle with whether it's strawberry flavors mango orange whatever just leave a comment down below let me know and I'll definitely try to see what I can put together to do that type of review so you guys can um get my opinions on that alright so that's it guys don't forget smoking takes lives vaping saves lives guys have a great day see on the next one", "LfdsaO34phE": "hello everyone and welcome to my channel I am low to describe and today I'm gonna be talking to you about a product that I have here that I have been using for a little while now I have been using CBD products before and they have helped me and so I decided to try this brand this brand is called just CBD and the these are their Signature Series cartridges the one that I have right now that I am currently using is the pineapple express this is a hybrid cartridge it says so right here on the label and another one that I have been using is the is the Sour Diesel this is one of those sativa cartridges they come in this clear plastic container with like a cork top so I think that's pretty nice that they do that this is how they actually look right here so this is the full-spectrum container this is glass right here and it comes with this pretty awesome wood tip and I shall see that right there how it looks and I have been using it with this vape pen its BIOS if y'all haven't heard of that brand or I'm sure that y'all have heard of the brand it's very good very reputable brand it comes with a that you can set the voltage down here at the bottom and you can choose which voltage you would like to have it as so with me I use CBD products mostly for my depression in my anxiety I also use it to calm my nerves whenever I feel stressed out or in a stressful situation I have used Lazarus naturals before the only thing with that is with that one it kept me up at night and then I did you CBD MD and that helped me as well and so I decided to try these out since I have been tired more tired lately and so I decided to try the pineapple Express and the Sour Diesel since the pineapple Express is a hybrid cartridge and I read on there it is a 60% sativa and a 40% what's a 60% sativa and a 40% indica and they're Sour Diesel is a sativa so they have lab reports on their cartridges and they also have lab reports on other products that they do have that y'all can check out so with these with the Geist CBD brand the cartridges they have another one also so they have the sativa the Sour Diesel the hybrid pineapple Express and they also have another one called Northern Lights now Northern Lights is an indica as for more of like whenever you want to relax more of you can use it before bedtime to help you sleep I haven't tried that one yet but I'm going to be trying that one soon enough I might get it later on today or tomorrow I have to see if I have time to actually go purchase it but these two cartridges that I have here they have been really helping me out lately with giving me more energy with giving me more of a positive outlook because usually with my depression I was given by the doctor antidepressants to take but I haven't taken those yet because I would like to try more natural stuff before I actually take antidepressants so I have been doing my research on what products to take I have been doing my research on on the different terpenes on that health depression and different terpenes that help would get more energy more activity more focused and so far these have really been helping me this brand has really been helping me so far and I'm gonna try there like I said I'm gonna try there indica Northern Lights and then also with this whenever I take a hit from it it is like the smoothest inhale I have ever taken from from a CBD brand it is like very very smooth on the throat does not irritate the tro does not irritate the lungs these two that I have they come in 200 milligrams CBD and it's 100% u.s. grown hemp has a right here on the label and also it has it on their website and like I said before they have lab reports on all of their products so y'all can check their products to make sure how much CBD or you are getting how much what the terpenes are that you are getting I highly suggest this brand I bought these out of my own money so I'm not endorsed I'm not a paid by them or anything and I don't have like a affiliate link to use I have just been using these out of my own interests and out of my own for my health to help me get better and so that I can do more one thing that I want to let you know that I have talked about in my other CBD products reviews is that with any CBD product there if you have to take a drug test there is a possibility that you come out positive for THC depending on your on where you work if they drug test you or if they don't there are people or companies that say like on here it says zero percent THC I'm not sure if you I can see that zero percent THC let me show the other one actually they have recovered up but it says zero percent THC on it and so whenever it says represent THC that is 0% basically it is under the amount that's that's not legal it's under the amount that's that's detectable for THC on the lab reports that they done but there have been cases in a group that I follow on facebook called CBD oil users I highly recommend y'all check it out if y'all can but on that group that I follow they have been cases where people have said that they took a drug test from their job and they came out positive and they ended up having to lose their job because they thought the product was you know the people told them it was zero percent THC you're not gonna be show up on a drug test and all that but you can on any CBD product you can show up on a drug test because over time it accumulates in the fat cells and it also depends on your metabolism and each person is different they're having people who have been on CBD for like a year and they have not come out positive and there's people that have been on CBD for a month and they have come out positive so it each depends on the person but as for these the gist CBD brands the pineapple Express in the Sour Diesel the taste I don't know if it's just me but they taste very similar but that just could be my taste buds I'm still you know China deciphered the flavor it's they taste to me more of like floral what do you type but that's just me and my taste buds and on what I've tasted so far there is another CBD product that I have been taking that our review next time and I just wanted to show you all these these ones that I had I bought these at my local smoke shop they had a very good reputable reputable brands that I seen these were $34.99 for each one and I would think that it's worth it because of the way that they look the way that the glass and the full-spectrum is and also comes with this really awesome tip one thing that I do get to say though that I didn't like about them it could be the shop itself on and on how long they had the product or it could be the way that they are packaged but when I first bought the my first cartridge which was this one it was gunked-up at the bottom it was gunked-up at the bottom and I'm not sure if you I can see these little holes right here but they were like black and I'm guessing because maybe the CBD oil with the conduit it just got clogged up and so when I went to take a hit and nothing came out so I had to go back I got another one that looked like this like they had the black and nothing came out of that one either until we found one that was clean one that was clear and I made sure with this other one to make sure that it was clean and clear and I took a hit from those that let me test it before I took it out to make sure that the product was working well and it was and since I've got these it's just been phenomenal so me personally I suggest y'all try it out if you want to like I said next time I have another product that I'm going to be reviewing by funky farms and so hopefully y'all stick around for that one so with these the pineapple Express the Sour Diesel and then the Northern Lights by just CBD and I also suggest checking out their website I'll put the website in the link in description down at the bottom so that y'all can check it out but if you are having any problems like let's say tired anxiety the or any other symptoms that you can find on the on ano zone there is CVD that might be out helping CVD can work for you or it cannot there are lots of products that are out there and it just takes time to find the right product that y'all are looking for I highly suggest if you are getting maybe like discouraged or anything don't give up on trying the product don't give up on on find the right one because whenever you find the right one it'll make a world of a difference thank you for sticking around and listening to my review on just CBD on their Signature Series vague cartridges and hopefully I'll enjoy talk to you later", "ud5ugKDvkHw": "hello boys and girls I'm coming to you with this video because I want to tell you a few things about these ecigs and I wanted to tell you about them because they are absolutely fantastic things to get now in no way am i promoting smoking I am coming on here to help you stop smoking in October me my husband went to Turkey and there the [ __ ] are unbelievably cheap and we smoked until we couldn't smoke anymore when we got back we decided to try these ecigs what we didn't want to stop smoking we just wanted to try and cut down for health reasons I am NOT getting paid to do this this video I have not got sent anything free I am doing this off moon back because this is an unbelievable product before we had this I used to smoke between 30 and 40 roll-ups a day then starting this I have smoked for [ __ ] one proper cigarette and three rollies in four days me husband he smoked 50 plus [ __ ] even he couldn't keep up without my out the amount of [ __ ] he was having he's had none in four days none nothing no [ __ ] Roly anything has touched his mouth in four days that's how unbelievable this product is and I just wanted to share it with you just in case you did giving off or you don't know whether these are any God so now I'm going to show you how it works and what you do were there and how to get the best results so this is what it looks like when it's all set up I've done I've blinged mine off so ignore that because it doesn't come with them but as you can see there's all writing around here and that actually says smokey Jack that's one of the better ones on the market when you get the all come separate these here have got the wick in them there's two wicks either side there's one there and there's one there and that's obviously what soaks up the liquid to give you the taste now depending on how much you smoke you have to keep two changing these if you don't smoke very often then they'll last you a couple of months but on average the lasts between three and five weeks so these you have to keep Goering this is the battery and this need this part needs charging off once a day we put it on charge overnight so we can then smoke it all day this is what the charger looks like this part goes into my phone charger so I just take the wire out from your phone stick this in and then I'll show you what you do with that this you screw in but you only screw it in until you reach the stop point don't do it any further there's a light that's on this this will light up red when it's charging these are what the liquids look like you can get get different strengths it starts at 30 milligrams 24 18 12 6 and 0 so my husband is on 24 because he smoked quite a lot so he needs a stronger taste this one he got is us mix and it tastes like tobacco the first one I started to use was grape and I'm on 18 milligrams yesterday I went to get this one which is passion fruit 18 milligrams these tastes just like they say this is definitely grape and this is definitely passion fruit if they are amazing now in these ecigs you get the nicotine in them not the tar or any other chemicals that's all you get is a nicotine it tastes like a normal egg it blows smoke out which is like a normal fire but it's not smoke it's vapor and I'll and I will show you in a bit what looks like to smoke so to put the liquid in these tubes you have different measurements equal to 1.6 mils just on this thought I was recording and wasn't so I'll just go through it that's where you put your liquid and the little round thing there with a hole in you do not get liquid in there so on all of these comes with a nozzle you stick it down the side as if you're pulling the pint like that and put and push the liquid in do not get any in that hole there because it will come out you'll taste eat it'll leak you just don't want that so you just do it like that give it a squeeze to put some liquid in put the top back on screw it on like that I felt I've done mine fault this now will last me at least a day and that's how much liquid of you since I've been using to fill these three times and that's how much liquid I've used so these are going to last a long time so that's how you refill them now in this bloke shop these are an unbelievable list of different products of liquid and what flavors you can get I will do a picture of each and every one of these now to show you you and I guarantee it all them flavors if you can see them because as there many will taste exactly what it says they taste like so after you've got these you just screw it back on again and then you have a button there you see the button before you start smoky and you press that you inhale let go and then blow out so you press the button lights up like that can hear it you press it and watch but that's vapor that's not smoke that also tells your brain that you having a flag it's all in your head and it's so satisfiying that each must nicotine and no nasty stuff you can even just have one of these ecigs and have no strength of tobacco in it at all we'll just pick the flavors that's what the blips doing in the shop he's never smoked in his life but he likes the taste of him so he has the one with no tobacco in it and just takes it you can smoke these anywhere you can smoke them in a restaurant you can smoke them in a hotel room anywhere that you can't smoke you can use one of these now this bloke has a lot of stuff there if there's anybody I'm sorry in the UK I can't post out to America I just

bye", "U__u6ipa1LU": "[Music] so basically today I'm gonna show you guys how to fix your computer or priestess usually the laptops that have this issue where it's stuck on what's called an infinite boot so basically what's happening here is either is gonna say something along the lines of starting up or it's could be saying in my case it said preparing auto repair and so it'll say that and then it just keeps restarting and it keeps showing that up personally for me for my sister at least it's been happening for the last few days I'm being I'm gonna show you guys how to fix this and a full disclaimer this video is for educational purposes only so if anything happens to your computer it's out of my control I had nothing to do with it I know that sounds really shady but I just have to say that hey something goes wrong but I will show you guys an in-depth tutorial on how to get this working and you can skip the in the video you'll see that it blue works oh yeah let's go right into me [Music] all right so let's get on to some solutions for you to get your pc up and working so your computer might look a little different than mine I have an HP computer HP laptop and so that's why it has this HP booting up logo screen figma do so currently mine says preparing automatic repair it might say something different for you but for these situations it's usually all the same steps just to get it up and working again the steps may differ depending on the device you have but in most cases it will be pretty much the same steps maybe a few different keys here and there but you can easily find your way to get to the screen that I'm on but I might use a different hotkey than your computer might use so that doesn't just might be where it differs but yeah let's get right into it so the first thing that you are going to do is you are going to go ahead and turn off your device I know even though you turn off device and turn back on is still going to show up the thing but this time around what you're gonna want to do it might differ depending on what computer you have but what I would do with my HP is as soon as I boot this up I would match the f11 key [Music] there you go so right here it says system recovery f11 and now it's gonna say please wait all right now you'll get to screen that looks similar to this well basically what you're gonna find here is you're gonna find they continue use a device troubleshoot we're turn off your PC what you're gonna do here is you're gonna go directly to troubleshoot I have a touchscreen laptop so I'm not gonna bother with this cuz it might be a little confusing for you guys alright so what's your here on this troubleshoot page you're gonna go ahead and hit reset this PC so what I forgot to mention I meant to mention this earlier I just totally forgot um totally some of mine I knew I was forgetting something well basically there are many reasons as to why this may happen to your computer a lot of the time it might be something where you powered off your device while the system was updating or it could be a malware issue or something like that in my sister's case she was 100n sure that wasn't a malware issue we had the antivirus software out there and she had not downloaded anything previously so once you get here if you're 100 minster you don't have any malware or any viruses on your computer you can go ahead and hit keep my files or you can't remove everything what I'm gonna do for the purpose of the story though I'm just gonna see if yours gonna hold on to the previous files over here and still work but it might work out different for you depending on the device you have you might even get different options but this is what it has for Windows 10 and yeah so I'm just gonna go ahead and hit keep my file alright so once you get here you might have to type in the password for the account that may be the administrator of this computer and I'm gonna type that in real quick so I'll get back to you all right so you're gonna up to this screen right here all you gotta do is hit reset be resetting and we're gonna let this sit here for a little bit and let it go because it's at 1% currently and I might take a little one so we'll leave it to rest all right it's been about an hour and you ever take 16 minutes all right so it's been about an hour and 20 minutes skipper tick now all this may have worked for me it might not work in every single scenario obviously there might be some cases where even if you tried the files on there am i end up getting corrupted and you might not be able to save your file yeah I was able to have all of it restored the account was still there and I just had it signed in and it's just loading up because we're at least in my case windows 10 ended up being corrupted and it just had to reinstall windows 10 take about you know an hour or so to reinstall so it's basically setting up like it's a brand new device but I should have all the files remaining in this PC I'm gonna leave this here for a little bit let it set up because it's pretty much being set up like it's brand-new I mean yeah I'll get back to you all right perfect so like all new computers so just have your Microsoft edge pop up but it'll stop all your files and stuff this was my sister's old screensaver and she still has all the items on your test bar and her theme was purple it's still there so everything's gonna be still here but like I said I'm still gonna have the disclaimer that your files may be removed in the process of trying for sheree laptop so that it works again but yeah guys that was pretty much it on how to restore your laptop to branding and so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this video if I helped you out go ahead and leave a like thumbs up and a comment letting me know what else I could do in the future and if you had any struggles if it's not working for you let me know down in the comment section below I'll do my best to get back to every single comment as I always do in all my videos and yeah then get so much for watching and I'll see you guys in my next video [Music]", "ov0bOZr_sN4": "[Music] welcome it's me pratima and today we're going to be estimating and investigating these some bottles and jars also we have a measuring cup let's go so we're going to estimate it i've written the names of each bottle and jar the lucas age bottle is this one with the orange lid the flower bottle is this one the pineapple bottle is this one the big jar is this one the small jar is this one and the medium jar has this blue lid now i'm going to write down what i think is the most and least i think the most has is the flower bottle and the list is the small jar [Music] now let's investigate let's investigate so here we're going to bring our measuring chart if you can't i'm not too sure if you can't see but there's intervals so let's first do this it's 110 milliliters let's empty this jug next our medium jar i think every time if i do it in the correct order so this one is 200 [Music] milliliters oh large jar even the lettuce is a bit happy 370 [Music] milliliters [Music] now on to the bottles heavy 430 milliliters [Applause] um next is a pineapple i never knew people would sell pineapple bottles in this world let's be careful when pouring this one because it's [Music] lost 510 milliliters now finally the flower bottle quite heavy let's throw this water away otherwise it wouldn't be true [Music] oh my god that was a lot 750 milliliters i guess i got the estimation correct this is the must and this is the list me i am happy but i would still be happy if i got it wrong because it was still an estimation", "6jBvgTATN5Y": "hey y'all trevor here with ready leaf and today we're gonna be tapping into the vape cartridge thursday we've got the spark torch from trailblazer here i'm really excited to see how the sativa dominant strain does i'll see you guys after the intro and when we get into this [Music] hail welcome back so we're tapping into a sativa dominant 510 cartridge today from trailblazer it's the spark torch it came in with a thc total of 70.7 percent a cbd total of 0.325 percent it was packaged on march 18th 2020. i'm really excited to see how this one does let's pull up a little bit of information on it and see what we can find hey guys so we've got the lift and co website here with the spark 510 thread cartridge info so trail blazers point five grams sativa sativa dominant spark 510 thread cartridge is terpene rich it also has ceramic atomizer for an optimal vaping experience its earthy switches citrus and sweet flavors stem from its terpene profile which includes meristening presented in mangoes lemongrass hops and thyme alpha penine which shares with pine and conifers rosemary and sage carafeline found in black pepper cloves and balsam and lemonade also found in citrus fruits and juniper so the top four effects typically felt oh i'm having a tough time getting through this one today you guys the top four effects that are typically felt are going to be happy energetic creative and focused the top activities that it is used for are socializing cleaning listening to music and working the top method consumption is via the vaporizer and the scents are going to be citrus sweet and earthy i am really excited to tap into this and try it out we're going to do just that let's get into it you guys we're going to start out with the fireside 510 vape cartridge and battery combo got the cartridge out let's get going on this review okay we've got the cartridge loaded up and on the fireside battery to start with i'm really liking the use of a half gram cartridge here from fireside here let's get you guys to focus there we go i don't know you're not gonna focus until i do that come on come on yeah you guys won't be able to see very well sorry but we got the cartridge here thc logo nice half gram nice glass or plastic tip it looks like i'm really excited to try this out so we're going to start out with the lowest temperature work our way up see what kind of flavors we're going to have presented through here and uh only way we're going to get to try this is by trying it you guys see on the other side okay that first one was quite tasty you guys really really flavorful so uh let's keep this going and see see if we're gonna have that strong citrus orange flavor all the way through this battery you guys cheers okay guys so it had continued to hold on to that really nice orange citrus flavor it does have kind of an earthy touch to it at the end a little bit of a spice but i'm not minding it at all actually it's um a nice light combo to match with that strong citrus flavor i found but let's uh keep trying this on you guys and uh see how she tastes on the highest temp see on the other side okay guys so we've swapped it over onto the g pen let's get that sucker set on the lowest temp and try it out through there i'm uh gonna give it a nine out of a ten for the taste of the fireside it's got that really strong citrus flavor but it's not something that makes me want to stop smoking bud and that's going to be the big carryover if it if i want to smoke this rather than bud you're going to get that 10 but if i'd still rather smoke the orange cookies from gage or something like that for the flavor the the cart can't quite get the 10 you guys or if it's comparable right alongside it like it doesn't need to be above it just at least equivalent i'll give it a 10 then so a 9 out of a 10 for the fireside vape battery let's see how the g pen dudes dudes you guys let's see how the jeep hand use jesus i need to get burnt my first little sip wasn't doing it cheers we bumped that g pen up to the medium temp i didn't get quite as strong of a citrus flavor through the g pen but i got more of an earthy with subtle citrus flavor and it's not bad it's definitely going to have something that uh that's gonna be unique at every temperature i think with this g pen and the only way we're gonna find out you guys is by tapping into it cheers okay guys so this is going into more of that earthy citrus realm it's got a little bit of a grapefruit tinge to it it's it's really interesting and really unique and i'm i'm looking forward to seeing how well this this continues to die it continues to does continues to do through the last temp on the g pen and then through the rigs it's it's gonna be interesting you guys but uh again only way about finding the only way we're gonna find out is by finding out let's tap into it i'm gonna give it an 8 out of 10 you guys for the g pen it had a nice flavor but it definitely wasn't comparable to the fire side here let's get to come on i want to switch temperatures on you there we go it wasn't comparable to the fire side with how strong the orange flavor pushed through it had a little bit more of an earthy tone that was still enjoyable it's just not as good as that orange flavor i'm definitely more of a sucker towards the citrus flavor if it is present but we've got the rigs ready we're going to take it through this little bubbler here at the three different temperatures and then we're gonna take it through the 420 catabolics rig as well for three reps with the g pen and we'll give you guys an overall score with that after we do it see you guys on the other [Music] side [Music] okay guys last rep preheat the sucker got it preheated put in the rig and get to it cheers [Music] hey guys so we're gonna tap into this let's uh let's start out with the g pen on the lowest hem and get up to the high one see on the other side [Music] hey guys so we're on that last vape rip through the rig that means we gotta pre-heat let's get to this cheers [Music] hey guys so i'm gonna give it an 8 out of 10 for the taste for my glass it has a really strong citrus flavor that doesn't go too sour or too tart on ya it stays relatively sweet it does go into that earthy side and it does have a touch of a pepper as well so that's gonna knock it off the two points there really it just there were some other rips admit mainly that middle temperature on the two batteries that was really harsh and really disappointing and i definitely didn't enjoy it as much as through just the fireside battery itself the best rip though was actually highest temp on the g pen which is really surprising for me but overall it did really really well there it's going to get a 9 out of a 10 with a high and that's just because it comes in with a really strong cerebral uplift and energetic eye it sits nice and smooth behind your eyes but it's not so strong that it's distracting it's kind of that let's go get up and do something and enjoy it like it's it's very motivational and uplifting without being intrusive and obstructive in what you're wanting to do at the same time it's it's overall really enjoyable high but i do feel the potential headache coming in and and lingering in when the initial hit of the high passes and i think that right there is going to be a big thing on why i'm not going to give it a 10. with the high i know pretty early on in the uh in the video if i'm going to give it a 10 out of a 10 and this one i was questioning right from the right from the first rip but with all of the nines and tens that i got nines and tens and all of the eights and nines that i got this video ends up getting a 34 out of 40 which is a solid score for this vaporizer really really nice it's got a good flavor just a little bit inconsistent through the different temperatures which could make it unenjoyable for some people but overall it did really well and it's definitely something i'd recommend checking out if you're looking for that mid-range price point um i believe is 45 for this cart regular price right around there in alberta and it's it's not bad for a half gram it's it's pretty good quality but we're gonna wrap this video up hope you guys enjoyed youtube stick around i've got

goof ejuice hey there ladies and gentlemen KJ and EO is back in the house this time I have an illiquid review of three flavors from goof ejuice they're located out of West Virginia I want to give a big shout out to Marta and Robert thank you so much you guys they included one extra bottle with my order I ordered two bottles and I got three in the mail I knew I was gonna get them but I got a I even got to pick the flavor but it's just too cool really nice people all right so check this out guys 110 middles just like this one only $20 and not just that the shipping $2 flat rate can't beat that at all the ratio it's a 70/30 blend all three of these there's 70 VG 30 PG nicotine strengths available are zero one point five three six and twelve I have all mine in three that's what I prefer they have around 100 flavors guys you go to their main page there may be like 11 flavors there but you go to the second page and there's like more options to choose from and it totals I was counting it kind of quickly but it looks like around 100 flavors today I'm reviewing three of them they're banana cherry bomb' and dunkers blue the flavor intensity I would say is around moderate on these juices it's right in the middle between low and high they're definitely all day vape so you're not gonna get sick of them you could bake them all day long and there's not too much flavor so it's great it's good for that purpose indeed you could purchase them from goof - II - juice calm I will leave a link to them in the description down below so you can head over there and check them out and get your own bottles today and there's some just some background information that I found we don't goof around at goofy juice we give you the best darn a juice at the lowest darn price period so don't goof around get your goof on made here in the good ol USA goofy juice has quality ingredients USP and all that jazz simple flavors - please great prices that can't be beat with a stick that's all you need to know and it also says that and the fact that goofy juice is brought to you by the makers of n Dahlia mist yes sir II told you you can count on goof ejuice for top quality and flavor we promise we deliver so Vandalia mist is the parent company behind goof EGS alright and the vandalia mist flavors are you know a bit more complex these goofy juice flavors are a little simpler and whatnot but they do deliver I'm pretty sure they do we're gonna find out right now the first flavor I'm going to go over is banana and that's the way it is printed on the bottle BH na h na age and i've been sampling these the last couple days i got him a few days ago and I've just been sampling them but I wanted to push this review ahead because there's some information stay tuned at the end of this video there's some important information all right so let's do a smell check and you break it open and smell it it smells like fresh ripe bananas okay and that's really what it is for the description I couldn't really find a description they just have like a like a little thing that just says fresh ripe bananas so definitely smells like it let me taste it it's pretty much fresh ripe bananas there's a little bit of a candy essence but not much it's more along the fresh ripe banana line okay alright so this one I have loaded in the twisted messes rd8 on top of the RX 200 s and I got a fuse cleft and build in there right now and I'm vaping it at 88 Watts then at 88 Watts right let's do it delicious I've been like looking for good banana flavors and not like banana in this banana and there's just like a straight banana and this is it right here smooth on the throat smooth out the nose exhale nothing burning your peppery nicotine is good to go definitely really good flavor I mean it definitely tastes almost as close as you could get to a banana with the liquid as far as I've tasted maybe I've had one or two that are a little bit more realistic but they're blended with other stuff so they're not a straight banana this is like a straight banana on the way in it's dark definitely very much like a sweet ripe banana okay on the way out really the same thing you know so alright I know where I'm at I'm gonna give it a cagey antio flavor rating of four and a half out of five that's what I feel it deserves it's really close to the real deal okay there's maybe just a touch of candy element in there barely though barely it's almost not even detectable okay so that being said I think that sums it up with banana buy goof ejuice and I'm gonna save the big production for last since they're all the same and let's just go on to the next flavor right about now the next flavor I'm going to go over is cherry bomb and here's a look at the bottle by the way I mean they all look the same they just have different names in different colors so it has the name of the company as the name of the flavor has their website address three milligrams nicotine has the VG PG ratio printed right on the bottle bonus points for that also and ingredients and warnings and all that kind of good stuff so and they're also very easy to squeeze some of these bottles are like so tough to squeeze not these alright let's go over the description to Cherry Bomb it says you know when you used to wake up at Grandma's house on a Sunday morning and could smell the sizzling sausage and eggs downstairs well this juice tastes just like Gerry's silly description right so it's a cherry profile juice and you know how most cherry for profile juices taste like cough syrup guarantee you this does not totally and we're gonna open it up and smell it I mean I'm getting cherry but I'm getting more than that it's almost like it's almost like a cherry fizzy like if you took like cherry juice and put it in with like soda water that's the way it's coming off that's the way it's smelling all right let me do a taste test well it's like real cherry I mean it's definitely like real cherry there's some other element I'm not exactly sure I cannot pinpoint it okay but I'm definitely getting that cherry fizzy type the essence in my mouth all right so this one I have loaded in the limitless 24 RDA on top of the X taste 250 and here we go wow really good and I never have found a cherry babe that I like yet until now yeah it's definitely reminding me - you ever like a cherry fizzy you know I wish they would have wrote the description to be like that because that's really what it appears to be to me and I let someone else try this last night and they're like yeah yeah it's much more than sherry is it's like a cherry soda you know like a cherry fizzy you know smooth out the nose has maybe I hear a bit of a throat hit nothing too major though not bad but I just noticed that it hits the throat just a little bit you know and some fruit flavors could do that we all know that so uh yeah I mean it really is close definitely really is close okay yeah they don't really mention it it's like a cheery fizzy but that's what it tastes like to me and because it's just that little hair bit off I'm gonna give it a kgo flame yeah KJ Andy oh I can't talk today flavor is four and a half out of five that's what I feel it deserves really good juice definitely really good juice if you like a good cherry flavor and you're sick of those cough syrup types go check this out cherry bomb by goof ejuice and that being said let's go on to the final flavor right about now the final flavor I'm gonna go over is dunkers blue this is one of the newer flavors that they made since their original ones and so is the banana that I reviewed at the beginning dunkers blue all it says it's a blueberry doughnut you guys know me I love donut flavors I love love love donut flavors I've certainly reviewed over 20 maybe 25 of them let's see how this one fares we're gonna do a smell check yeah I'm definitely getting blueberry I'm definitely smelling the donut cake not bad not bad let's do a taste test it's close I mean it's not perfect but it's close alright alright so this one I uploaded in the anarchist Aria built phenotype LS and I got it on the Aria and our kiss bill I'm sorry are you built a tower kissed Solara dna200 alright so this one I got it 70 watts 0.36 build here we go yeah not too shabby at all on the taste tine on you know when I did it on my tongue it was just maybe a little off you know totally smooth on the throat smooth out the nose really really close definitely really close I've had other blueberry doughnut flavors before that maybe we're just a little bit better but probably like double or triple the price and you know so if you want to pay those high prices go ahead but otherwise this definitely suffices it definitely fit fits my doughnut cravings you know on the way and I'm getting that like doughnut flavor okay maybe a hint of blueberry but on the way out kind of flip-flops a little I'm getting the blueberry up from the doughnut cake right behind it like I said it's definitely very close very very close so I'm gonna give it a kjn do flavor eating four and a half out of five just like the other two flavors okay they're really good they're definitely really good for the money you definitely can't go wrong there all day babes there's something you're gonna enjoy all day long so they definitely get a double thumbs up kjn do seal of approval here all right all right so that about sums it up with the flavors now we're gonna go on to the vapor production right about now for the vapor production they are a 70/30 blend I went back to the banana flavor and the twisted messes because this is probably the most cloud making RDA of the three that I'm using right now and maybe the limit list but not happy with the airflow on that so I'm gonna go with the twisted messes here we go let's do this definitely clouds up really nicely stays in the air dense clouds they drop down I meant a hundred watts right now I turned it up just a little bit drip a little bit more here not doing it dried it today guys all right here we go one for you guys in YouTube land clouds it really nicely right alright so it is a 70/30 it performs just like a 70/30 [ __ ] that being said I'm going to give it a bigger production rating up four out of five that's what I feel they deserve really clouds up really nicely good use all-around good juice for the money like I said you definitely cannot go wrong okay so go check them out at goof - e - juice calm I will put a link to them in the description down below and now onto some other things okay okay so something else

about two great personalities from the 510 Jays lineup on our box of 5 10 album we're going to be talking about the Latin percussion side of things with David Stockman we're featuring on congas and we're also talking about Tony song who is our guitarist playing on acoustic and electric guitar I met David Stockman at a vocals class that I took at a low D college and david has quite a background in Latin percussion he played a lot with jazz pros when he lived in New York City it was a real treat to bring David into 500 jazz for the vasa 5 10 album David primarily played Congress but he is a master of all of the different styles of Samba bossa afro-cuban and we just love the way that David's added this extra Latin taste or flavor I met Tony song when we were performing with the pay it forward volunteer jazz band playing an elder care facilities in San Jose Tony and his wife Susie are both brilliant musicians from the Berkeley School in Boston tony has an amazing style on guitar electric in nylon string acoustic guitar I really feel the tony's guitar embodies the the spirit of Bossa 5 10 when I think back in the 60s with the great bossa nova master so many of these songs were simple arrangements of just vocals and guitar and when I hear Tony playing his classic acoustic nylon guitar it brings me back to the feeling that I heard of those songs from the 60s from the greats but also on electric and songs like Maui loon Tony just has a superb style and his phrases are always incredible you can just always rely on Tony to come up with something wonderful to add an extra bit of feeling to the song you need to change us see me", "yYvxtldOlTw": "[Music] hey guys and welcome back to my channel today we are playing some more b storm simulator and in today's video guys we're going to be well not really today i'm going to be showing you guys a snowflake guide on how to get snowflakes really fast so as you guys can see i have 2868 snowflakes i mean 65 oops i used one oh it's fine so yeah you guys are probably wondering oh okay okay guys before we start this video we need to do this snowstorm okay i love snowstorms because i always get between 15 to 20 snowflake tokens i probably only get about 10 10 on the strike since i don't have too much haste okay i got seven eight come on come on yes nine ten no 11 that's minus 912. we actually have actually getting pretty good 13. huh okay got 17 snowflakes just just like that just really easy okay so before i start the guide on how to get snowflakes really fast we're going to be handing my present i have a present right here over to mr polar bear so let's just come down hill press e i'm just happy uk my cousin bieber entirely identify is a centered on business at first our family thought it was good but we've become so so supportive over the years bees miss brings bee bear joy and gives him a sense of purpose who are we to judge we all have our quirks me i'm obsessed with cooking so i hope you brought a cooking related gift come on let's see what you brought me crumple couple nice a pressure cooker i've been wanting one of these for ages for some dishes this can cut cooking times in half now for your gifts some enzymes gingerbread bread and and the cast iron skillet ornament with this on the tree to 25 convert rate 27 percent capacity in the pumpkin patch and 10 white field capacity that's pretty good well good luck on the rest of your b bear requests happy honey days okay now we're gonna oh here we go there's an ornament oh that's actually pretty cool how many gingerbread we got two so how many do i have no what 59 that's nice okay so the first thing you want to do when you enter the game usually is you want to go and head and defeat all your rhino wheels because every rhino bill gives you snowflakes your vinyl beetles and your mantises they're the ones who actually give snowflakes 100 sure and smells like some and uh i mean mantises sometimes even give you like five for three so let's just go ahead and do all that yeah i might as well just get the ladybug tokens but yeah see snowflake one snowflake token if we come down here we should get one too well i have the boost right now okay see we got another slow fake token now we come to bamboo and then we'll get two more watch i'll have 2886 after these two 100 sure boom boom see rhino beatles they always are gonna give you snowflakes and you can do this every five minutes and every 20 minutes you can come up here always defeat this fan or beetle but also defeat your mantis might just come every 20 minutes so you can do this the three mantises every 20 minutes and yeah it's probably only gonna give me one yeah one snowflake so as you guys can see we already have uh 2888 now i'm pretty sure i can do my other two mantises right now so let's just go ahead and do that okay here we go guys here we go snowflake token and always get yourself like tokens just like that just like okay werewolf is back please give me gingerbread bear please no i've been using like guys i've been using baby love for this so many times i never got a gingerbread bra and then one time i didn't use baby love broken i got a gingerbread bear like why that's just so weird okay let's see if we can do a yes we can snowflake talk it's a little thick token let's go go easily defeat these guys and boom can we get one snowflake for mantis yeah okay so we got about like five okay so yeah let's see how many snowflakes we got just from that she got one from clover two from bamboo one from blue flower one from pineapple i mean two that's five we got seven snowflakes and every five minutes you can at least get four snowflakes i mean five snowflakes which is actually pretty good that's pretty good guys right yeah you can also get five snowflakes every five minutes that's pretty awesome now the second way you can get snowflakes is probably the way i hate the most but it gives you the most and that is defeating snow bear mine's level 10 but there's no way i'm defeating this guy oh yeah also spiders can also give you snowflakes i like hundred percent sure they'll always give you snowflakes let's see how much i get actually yeah got three isn't that awesome guys yes okay i got three snowflakes that's why i liked it oh my god that's why i like doing this strategy whenever i'm farming in my cactus field or whatever pepper patch i always every five ten minutes i always come here do all my snowflakes and do all my mobs and get all my snowflakes so i'm pretty sure they think that's the best way to do it if you're a pro you can probably just do a snow bearing to like level 24 oh god oh my gosh and yeah i can't even do i got help with snowballs from level 2 to 10. i only did one by myself that's how hard there so yeah okay now the last way to get snowflakes is probably the way that you gotta work for the most because you got to complete this the gifted buckle bee's question his question is insane especially people like me okay so let me just show you no let me show you guys what it is so yes let's just get some you need some haste for this is summoning a snowstorm now summing a snowstorm is pretty cool you get about 15 to 20 snowflakes so let's go ahead and test it out you can do this every two hours which i think is pretty awesome and always come oh i can't get it no no no

to be able to buy things from quickly get that from bieber's catalog now i'm probably never that will get this because gingerbread this is so hard to get oh my god but you can easily i'm not gonna get any of this stuff what i would i really recommend getting is saving 10 000 and buying a star treat because that's pretty cool and i can't buy it oh okay another thing i recommend maybe the puppy reindeer atlas is still permanent but not really maybe the mythic egg that looks pretty cool i want to make the egg and yeah just some of these bundles you can use snowflake that's why snowflakes are really important in this business update and it's only here for another about 44 days so yeah that's just my three ways to get quickly get snowflakes as fast as you can so yeah that's just my guide on

the Vandal a mesh art he hung up however nuts and a colleague's hang so I have got a calling in here and just so we can rest yeah and let's gather a vape of my thoughts and where I think you should would get some yourself well that is even more intense well with the word once it's been vaporized the menthol as their as an after tone and under no but the man thaw has stealth Wagner that is really really nice actually well yeah that will be making my favorite less as I could use that as on all day vape and I think we're you know what dead that is unholy babe and I'm not usually a bag menthol fine however this line here seems to have the mental balance just right so therefore I don't really have a major problem with that and that's why so overall I'm going to give that's juice is solid B

Cummings and some John Ashbery it's a signed second edition book anyway I'm here to review the new Hyde's I just came out with strawberries and cream they just came do punch it's a green color alright peach mango watermelon I got it standard mango strawberry has been a salad mainstay of theirs they come in a few different sizes they come in this hitter they come in these at shorts all right and then they come in this right here which is basically like a jewel type stick but I'm gonna review all the different flavors they came out with they got pink lemonade cherry lemonade pineapple ice is a classic of theirs if you're already familiar with Hyde they are selling out faster than anything I've seen a small shops in my area can't keep them in you got your blue razz the blue rays is kind of like an understated flavor it doesn't really overpower your taste buds but it does taste like a blue slushie from like when you were a kid and lunch class lunch class and lunch strawberries and cream tastes like an angel food cake thing again it leaves a nice after taste on your tongue they say you can get 400 hits out of these if you chief it and you take some major freaking clouds in if you got lungs of Steel maybe you'll only get 300 hits out of it I can make a single one of these hides last for about a week five days depends on what I'm doing how I'm chief in it so let's get right into it peach mango watermelon okay you got this little light at the end of each of the hide models doesn't matter which kind you get whether you puff now one of these shorts which looks like this these things hit the best they're like a straw bro but okay back to this peach mango watermelon the flavor is right there on the tip of your tongue if you chief these too much you will start to sweat they are strong it says 50 milligrams it's salt nicotine in the battery inside of them and a little tank that's filled with some kind of cotton and the cotton it has all the juice in it and they're disposable when these hitters are done these hitters is dumb Bowie with the peach mango watermelon if you're familiar with the water mount ice flavor this will surprise you because it doesn't taste like watermelon so much as it does taste like peach this really has like a nectarine sort of citrusy quality to it but it also has a little bit of like a creamy dessert thing in the background this is a complicated flavor I give it a 10 out of 10 I'm not even big on deserty flavors next we're gonna go to honeydew punch again this one has like a greeny type lime colored design to it pop that top off get to hit honey do punch is one of their more complex flavors as well honeydew has a sort of fragrant floral sort of taste to it you're gonna get some of like that mango e type flavor it's kind of inexplicable there's nothing else really like this the flavor sits on your tongue you don't get sick of it really fast you could teeth on this thing all day and come up with different ways to describe it my best description of it was that it is like fragrant and almost floral in the way that it is sweet and it tastes like a mango like a honeydew kind of like a Kiwi thing to it it's not so much candy as it is fruit if you know what I mean the crazy custard all right this was possibly my favorite and again I'm not even big on the desert type juices in the past when I see other juicers out there I'm not big on my buddies is types things where they got like those strawberry shortcakes or those vanilla you know it just tastes like cake but man oh man this crazy custard tastes like vanilla pudding it tastes like rice pudding it tastes like you can't even describe this stuff man this thing just came out of like a bakery or something it's just like custard being poured on your tongue you're definitely getting some of that vanilla flavor to it but again it really does taste like something that came out of a Bake Shop like you bit into a doughnut there's a candy out there that has like that white center but it has like the like a sweet parts kind of like strip I forget who makes it but it kind of tastes like that strawberries and cream again we're just gonna review this strawberries and again the cream is kind of in there the strawberries are sweet and the cream is there and sort of like a vanilla way that's not too deserted your cake like but you are gonna get some of that cream in there so strawberries and cream is more creamy than it is strawberry next up is black cherry lemonade I smell hot in are you okay straw or tarry lemonade one misnomer about cherry vapes in general is that they're gonna smell and taste like cough syrup not the case this is gonna surprise you you know it doesn't smell like cherry skull none of that the cherry isn't so much sweet as it is like a deep cherry tastes like a cherry kool-aid almost and the next thing we're gonna do is check out blue red blue rez is kind of an understated new flavor of hides hide hit my city of Rochester New York this summer there's a couple shops that sell these and they sell right out of them as soon as they get them they make a tobacco flavor I'm not big on it they make several nice flavors and accompanying to their regular flavors you can get a lot of these in ice but not the new ones for example you can get mango and mango ice you can get light key ly CH AE and you can get like to ice you can get glue and kind of an ice and these are better than all of the other like disposable handheld vapes that I've had and I'm not the kind of guy where I want to be you know running around going to my car getting that little drop or reef my mod my my rig all the time I'm more of like a boom boom kind of guy so blue razz is the next flavor it is blue as can be but now when you get these there's a light on the bottom and it blinks when they're out but they're never totally out you can let it sit overnight and then you can hit it the next day a few times and it will keep going like that until the battery fully dies or unless until the device sort of recognizes that it's added juice this one has hints of like a monster blue energy drink to it the blue res isn't jumping out in your tongue it will leave you with a nice aftertaste a nice feeling it's very fresh these hides you can't even tell it there is like a coil in there that there's heat and they're producing this vapor that you're inhaling like I've only had a couple of cases and they've usually been with the short where I can taste like when they start to get burned out a little bit so that does sort of happen but it's not a typical thing that happens with these hides let's see here um alright let's get on to pink lemonade um a minute ago I was talking about pineapple I guess this is one of the last believers that I'll review and then I'll leave it to you to get out there and see them but again we are talking about peach mango watermelon strawberries and cream honeydew punch blew res cherry lemonade honeydew punch crazy custard pink lemonade standard strawberry and pineapple ice now if you're the kind of guy who loves you some menthols and you want that nice fresh like you want to taste that minty like throat opening senses kind of tingling I feel then you might really dig all their ice flavors I mean I really give a whack at each of them I haven't tried the tobacco flavor not gonna lie via the pineapple ice is one of the hides that tastes most like the fruit that's on the package I mean when it says pineapple we're talking about pineapple baby this thing I mean you feel like you're dragging out fruit cup that was somehow turned into a vape juice it is so loyal to the actual like flavor of pineapple it's indescribable now the ice part if you're looking for that menthol e type of refreshing thing it's got that in the background but it's not overpowering so if you don't like menthols you know give their ice the ice hide flavors a chance some are more menthol e than others some flavors I didn't pick up today were fire and ice they had C there was a purple one that smelled like lilacs then there was also like a mint there was a mint one that was interesting you know it looked like a Spearman type of tea flavor you should get out there and try that one but that's it for this video I'm gonna wrap this up just by saying thanks for watching and if you found it thanks for finding me I I write poetry I play guitar I listen to good music and I live life to the fullest puffing on these vapes that's it and a soul man get out there and try these hides leave a comment which one's your favorite bro yeah straightforward", "r3vy40x0QJg": "- Hey guys, Easter is\nright around the corner, and you know what means,\nit's carrot cake season. I wanted to share with\nyou my ultimate recipe for carrot cake, it is moist and decadent, and flavored with just\nthe right amount of spice, raisins, pineapple and nuts, all my favorite things\nto put in a carrot cake. Let me show you how to put it together. In a large bowl, you're\ngonna crack in four eggs, to that you're also gonna\nadd a cup of vegetable oil and a cup and a half of sugar. You can whisk that all up\nuntil everything is combined and then you're gonna add\na cup of crushed pineapple. I really love to add\npineapple to carrot cake because I think it adds\na really nice sweetness and will keep that cake nice and moist. You do wanna drain the\npineapple first, though. And then you're also gonna\nadd 3/4 cup of water, two teaspoons of vanilla, then in a medium bowl\nwe're gonna add 4 1/4 cups of all-purpose flour, two\nteaspoons of baking powder, one teaspoon of salt and three teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice. Now, because I'm American I\nlove my pumpkin pie spice, but if you live outside\nof the United States and you can't get it,\nyou could also just use two teaspoons of cinnamon\nand one teaspoon of nutmeg. So you can whisk up your dry ingredients and then you're going to\nadd the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, just in thirds, mixing until everything\nis nice and combined. And then the next step is to\nadd two cups of grated carrots and one cup of raisins. And you can stir that all together. Then you're gonna pour your batter out into two nine inch cake pans, just equally distribute it, and then you're gonna\nbake at 350 for about 20 to 25 minutes, just until a\ntoothpick comes out clean. While your cake is cooling, we can get on with making the frosting, and is just a simple\ncream cheese frosting. So in the bowl of an electric mixer you're going to add two eight ounce tubs of whipped cream cheese, I like to use the whipped cream cheese, but if you can't find that you can use just the\nregular brick kind as well, 2/3 cup of powdered sugar and then we're also gonna add\na teaspoon of vanilla extract. And then you're just gonna\nbeat the cream cheese with the sugar until\nit's nice and combined and then you're gonna\nadd a cup of heavy cream and what this is going to do is, as we beat it together,\nit's going to thicken the cream cheese mixture\na bit and lighten it so it's actually beating that cream almost like whipped cream would and you'll end up with a\nreally smooth light frosting. That will be as heavy as a traditional cream cheese frosting. So you're gonna take about\nhalf of your frosting and put a nice generous\ndollop in the center of your first cake layer and then we're just gonna smooth that out with an offset spatula and then we're gonna add two tablespoons of unsweetened coconut flakes. I like to use the unsweetened because you get the real coconut flavor without a lot of sugar and I find that it's just a little bit better and not as sweet that way. And then on top of that we're\ngonna add some chopped pecans, about two tablespoons as well. And I just think it's\na nice unexpected twist to have the coconut in\nthe nuts in the frosting as opposed to the cake, 'cause there's already a\nlot going on in the cake, between the pineapple and the carrots and the raisins, so this way\nwe kinda distributed it all. Then you're gonna pop your\nother layer on top of that, can go ahead and add the\nrest of the frosting on top and give that a nice\nspread with your spatula and then we're gonna do the same thing, we're gonna add the\nremaining shredded coconut and top with the chopped pecans. Then I do like to take this cake and pop it in the fridge\nfor at least an hour or two before you serve it,\nbecause that will help that cream cheese frosting set up a bit, which will make it easier to\ncreate nice, clean slices, when you go to serve it.

Until then, bye.", "WeQYTrWaHQg": "they would tofo recurve how's it going everybody this is a B&E and today we're gonna be taking a look at the wood tofo recurve here little clad between Mike vapes and wood tofo on this RDA here like eyes are gonna go over these specs on it have a vape on a dive into coast of look see what it comes with take a look at the deck all that good stuff bring it back up top had a few more babes I'll give you my overall thoughts on the wood tofo recurve by Mike faves spec wise diameter on here you do have the top cap on it's going to be 24 millimeters around so you will want to make sure that your mod can accommodate a 24 millimeter diameter RDA up on top it is a single coil Ardea it does come with an 810 drip tip up top it actually comes with two 810 drip tips I've got the clear one and I'll show you the other one in the close-up here in a second it's also going to come with 3.3 ohm coils inside of here that I do actually have in here right now it's coming in at point three three on the pulse and then it comes pre-installed with the squawkin installed have a quick vape I have cloud heads pineapple inside of here right now in the squonk Tony be Vande vape collab 80 watt pulse and then I've got the 0.3 it's coming in at 0.33 ohms on the pre-built coil that does come with this recurve right here let's go ahead and have a babe all right you can see the packaging on the recurve RDA see the mic vapes logo right there flip it on over you see what it comes with with tofo recurve them like vapes made in china manufactured by with tofo see what it comes with the recurve user manual comp wire coils driptip 510 adapter Japanese cotton extra screws and overhangs slide this box open inside the box you will get a user manual it actually tells you about installing the coil here just unscrewing the post dropping the coil in tightening the post holes wicking it on up priming the coil putting the top cap on and you're ready and just switches languages there inside of this package here I just popped it out you'll get an extra trip tip and then a 510 driptip adapter here you can see it also comes the blue one on here bluish purple on here right now but you just pop that off pop this drip tip on there inside of here you can see I've already used the cotton that comes with it this is some Japanese organic cotton you get the screwdriver you can take a look at the coils that do come with it coming in around point three point three five is the resistance of these you can see it comes with four of these standard 510 pin if you do not want to use it as a squonk ER and then you get some extra screws you can see down in there some you can see I put that little white frosted white drip tip back on there see the airflow pop this tap cap off now I am using the coils that do come with it I have one pre-installed in here along with the cotton you can see the with tofo logo post hole screws airflow very very very nice as far as setting this one up if you guys want to see a separate video I could do that it is super easy and straightforward takes about ten minutes even if it's your first RDA setting it up it's a good one to start with because it is so straightforward and simple easy to install using the coils that come with it and the cotton it takes about 5-10 minutes if it's your first time maybe twenty minutes but no longer than that got the cotton in there nice and saturated got on top of the pulse Vande babe squawk regulated see the airflow line and uh and then you do like I said it comes with the 510 driptip adapter and then two of the 810 drip tips I like this frosted white one on here right now oh yeah that's pretty much gonna take care of the close-up let's bring it back up top have a few more babes on and give my overall thoughts on the with tofo recurve RDA by Mike babes alright now they've got the clothes by the way it's going to be a few more babes I still have big cloud heads pineapple in here and still I have the 0.3 ohm coil you guys just saw in the close-up preinstalled again it's coming out to point a 3-3 exactly and I've got it at 51 watts on the pulse let's go ahead and move ape airflow is all the way open on here right now I like the airflow you can just twist the top cap just a tad close it off open up a little bit but I do have it the air flow all the way open I like the air flow a lot on the single coil build go ahead and got it juiced up again gonna bump it up to sixty Watts here that's pretty much speed max I like to go on this actually I'm not normally vaping at 60 watts on this point 3 ohm I like the 40 45 50 range for between 40 and 50 on the coil that does come with it but you can choose what kind of cool you're gonna install I'm just showing you what actually comes in the box with a recurve because that's what I've got in here right now so let's go ahead and have it vape at 60 watts there you can see pretty fantastic a vapor production on this single coil build at only that was 60 watts there for an RDA the flavour is definitely above average it's not the best I've ever had but it's really really good flavor that comes out of this and also you can mess around with different coil builds as well this is just the standard point 3 ohm coil that does come with it so if you guys been watching this channel for a while now you know I don't usually do refillables too often I do a few math lung RTA's every once in a while but for the most part I'd say ninety ninety-five percent either either regulated devices tanks or little stealth systems compared to rebuildable is here but for a rebuildable I like the mic vapes with tofo recurve a lot I like the look of it a lot for one I like the flavor but and I like the flavor vapor production out of it I like the airflow I like the - 810 drip tips that are included on here but my favorite part about the wood tofo recurve is the fact that it's extremely extremely easy to build just drop the coil in there wake it up and you are ready to go whether using as an RDA or as a squawking RDA I think it's definitely better this right here works much better as a squawking RDA compared to just a standalone argh a by itself it you can use it though as an RDA like I said it's just there's some better options I think out there but it has the capability of doing both but in terms of ease of use setting up install even if it's your first RDA it's super straightforward like I said down on the close-up when we were filming that if you want to see everything start to finish on the recurve here so you can get it set up use your first RDA let me know down in the comments and I will go ahead and do that because this guy getting out of the box even if it is your first are you you could have it up and running within 10 minutes on a squawk mod like this if you want to pair it with the regulated squonk pulse by Tony B and Vandy vape because it does come with your standard pin as well if you want to use it not as a bottom-feeding squonk RDA but it's just super easy straightforward drop the coil and tighten it up and you are vaping of course after you wick it and then maintenance after that is super easy it's a great beginner intro RDA and then for people that already do like RDAs it's a good option for a single coil squonk that works like perfectly for example on the vanity of a pulse 80 watt if you guys have any questions that's pretty much gonna wrap it up if you have any questions on this or you do want to see that video or anything other vapor later please leave a comment down below and I'll do my best to get back to you if you guys did enjoy this video please be sure to leave a thumbs up and subscribe it is greatly appreciated and as always", "zHAhDfnIECY": "[Music] hey everyone welcome back to my channel it's your girl Mariah if you were new to this channel welcome if you were returning subscriber welcome back um before we get into this video I want to you guys to subscribe like comment and share this video um this video is going to be a video that um kind of gives you guys how about like an idea of what I use to help me deal with my anxiety back in January I suffered my very first like severe anxiety attack which also led to a panic at hot um which I had to be rushed to the hospital I couldn't breathe I really didn't know what was happening in like guys I was talking to the nurses and you know everybody they kind of you know knew the symptoms and you it was so they didn't want to medicate me but to you know speak to a group in one so before that happened I was taking a product called just CBD they were gummies they were featuring gummies I think there were about like 250 milligrams for CVD I believe I don't have the continuous with a lot of them um so I was using those those helped me a lot with like sleeping just getting through the day I'm I normally take one in the morning and then take one at night from what I was going to bed um and then I switched over to the vape CBD I know in some areas um vaping is banned I'm in my state it's the e-cigarettes um when choosing you brand for vaping and I know like I said everyone's gonna be like oh baby it's dangerous I think this um being able to find a brain that you trust um with their products and you know what's in it they're transparent about it with something big going into it um I have a smoke shop in my area in downtown Boston in the cold smoke city shop I will link them down below they also sell just CBD products they sell the gummies but they don't so be the they being or the cartridges um so I wanted to show you guys a little haul of items that I got now do you also want to clarify in this video this is not a sponsored video by just CBD these are thought of my own products just brought my own money and so nothing you know was sent there's no sponsorship in the city I'm not being paid for this this is my own opinion my own thoughts on the brands as a whole so without further ado we're gonna jump right into it and we're gonna open these little bad boys I did split it to make sure everything was any in make sure I had everything that I got in it so we're just gonna jump right into it so the first item we are going to pull out is a date juice I got this in the flavor mango mango ice is the flavor and it's a hundred and it's a hundred milligrams and we're gonna open it and see what it looks like on the inside so this is the big bottle that it comes with and this is like set for a pretty good decent price for it I believe it wasn't check step inside so these were $15.99 each so I have this flavor like I said it's the mango mango ice in that flavor and I spend on the side of the box um it does give you the where it's talks about it being um tobacco free conveniently need for your e cigarette vaping devices for intense sources and like I said CBD does not replace going to your doctor if you do take medication continue to consult your doctors on that me I just don't want to be medicated so like I said I do the gummies and now I'm like I said I'm switching over to the the oils I can so take it with me so I'm not carrying on this big bike like jock of gummy so it's kind of like another convenient for me I'm gonna see what other goodies I'm having here we also have the pineapple Express and this one comes based off of the Navy find out for sports if you have not seen it so it comes like this as well the same jar just different flavor you see it looks like a fair way to open it there we go you can smell it too so that that was also $15.99 I got three different flavors on this one is watermelon og time I want to get like flavors um if you do follow me on instagram you would have saw that I posted in a story I'm all plus the story in this video somewhere on the screen um I've gotten a pen from Busey so I have an Uzi pen the cartridge on top comes from panda sticks I believe that's how you pronounce it I will also link that pen in the cartridge down below if you want to go purchase those too I got that ez pen in that cartridge first because I knew this was coming and with everything going on I did not know if I was going to receive anything I'm via the mail but everything was still running normal and I got it within a good decent time frame so this is what the I said watermelon og looks like in this big bottle and I love the fact that the bottles are big like these are very big bottles for the price that I got them before like I've seen like I said in the smoke shop I go to they have like bottles smaller than this for the same price so I love the fact that these are big bottles they'll last me a while and I'm glad I got the three different flavors that they did I love the that I have so I'm really glad I got those and then I have a disposable cartridge it's like this is the watermelon so the Sigma C of OG 1 for it so this one is a disposable one this one is 200 milligrams for these cartridge let me open it so it looks like and then from boozy I did I do have an order coming from them my main include them in this video but it's this is more of a just EEE video because this is the main products that I'm going to be using like I'm not gonna go back to the Panda stick cartridge Luzi I'll keep the pen just cuz I have so I'll have the pen so I had two different pens so I also gun pen from just CBD but I'm just sticking to just CBD I'm not switching I'm not doing anything like I said I enjoyed the brain as a whole their response to customer service is really good like things like it's not like you're not waiting a whole entire day to hear back from somebody if you have an issue on a product I mean you can get a response right away so this is the and I may switch over to this one today this is what the pen looks like if I can get ever get it out hopefully by the end of this video I can get it out for you guys and show you guys what it looks like and put it on the pen so we're gonna sit this off to the side real quick so what they're also like I said I did order a battery so this is what the battery looks like um theirs is a 5-10 VV twist battery um the Uzi stick I have is also a 5-10 battery so I can also use the cartridges from just see beating on that pen in the future but like I said I did order 3 of the cartridges from Louise because I did order an Uzi pen so like I have three pens now so I have the first uz one be just CBD one I just showed you and then there's another one coming from Uzi so they each have their own cartridge and I can grab the Izzi pen and she goes it looks like I want to get this pout oh yeah my Lu Zhi ping it's like a little metallic like rainbow fish color the other one is a Rastafari so it has a Jamaican colors and this is the cartridge up top so the cartridge up top is from panda stick and like I said I will link it below and the stick is from and the battery is so easy so that is that one so I'm ordering so I ordered another battery in three of the cartridges to be able to fill because the only thing with just CBD I did not see and even I missed it but it's okay that they don't have like the cartridges sold on their own like he does like it was he has the ones which we can be filled with liquid so just CBD didn't have those and less like I said I missed it and I didn't see it hopefully in the future they do release some like that so we're like individually in the art empties like this one is if I don't think I can get the cap off for this one I can try but I so this is what this one looks like is the like I said the watermelon flavor we're gonna do a test to see how it tastes and like I said as I know people's concerns are she like be safe and I am like I said I'm not walking around like every hour gaping I'm I normally do it in the more like in the morning when I wake up I do about two to pups that's it um and then that night same thing two puffs that's it so I'm not like so because the guy was like oh this cartridge should last you you know only a couple of days like this has lasted me like almost a week and I guess I can show you what it looks like when everything goes down but has lasted me I pretty decent amount of time because I'm not pulling on it and I keep it my pen stays on 3.3 v so it does not leave that area so it does not leave you can see it on the bottom it does not leave that smart so like it's on the lowest of the low so I'm not puffing so much so this is what the pen looks like and I love that piece and these have a lower voltage so these this one starts at two point two point zero B this one starts at three point three in the highs that it goes to is four point zero which I love so I can definitely put that on a smaller voltage I'm sold it like I said so and then this is my charging port that will go into it like I said I also have another the same thing came with this one that was e1 mix and I love effect you just twist and it comes on so these are the two that I have like I said this one is just CBD which is labeled is label sorry about that my camera dies I'm gonna make this really quick so these are the two that I have and then the last item I don't know like there was a certain thing going on but they sent me a free a free item I don't know if I mean it's like I never tried this so this is there just and it's a body soap I'm so I'm down there to really try this in the flavour of cherry pie and it smells really good I open the box I like what I'd like smells really good I didn't know this was even in there so I'm kind of a little free treat to try it so you guys so I'm definitely I'm going to try this come to night and see how I like it and see how it worked like fields and they said it's created for all faces and all skin types to enjoy to him him Ronnie so so it's handcrafted body so label and sing it with it I'm not the lighting looks different in the camera looks flipped in a different way please excuse me I kind of switch over to my phone to film the remainder of it so yeah so this is the soap duck I said that came with it um this one I did not purchase on my own um this one was sent in the box I don't know if it was like a free gift and he spent so much I said I opened it it was in there so thank you just see beauty for this one um but like I said I'm so proud of everything that I had like I said the stick the bat the flavors and I definitely would have you guys posted on how you know I'm doing with them and like I said I love them all to death like the company in itself is all is a good brand um I hope they do come out with more flavours um I hope that they do come out with just the cartridges on their own I'm not pre filled with anything so you can just order it all together as weight on one but yeah if you are interested in any of the products or have any questions you can also definitely shoot me and leave a comment down below or you can also screw me ng M I will link all the products down

sugar-free gum means they have to dry fruit they have all different types for anyone looking and if you want to know more information about CBD oil and CBD and how it works I will definitely leave

anything um like I said they clearly say on their site that they do not none of their products continue vitamin E which should be all do by me II was what was in a cigarette that was killing people and causing lung issues with their products like I said the Panda stick I checked on their site too as well they have listed that they do not use vitamin E in their CBD oils I'm CBD everyone's like Oh CBD you should high it sweet no CBD does not get you high CBD is part of my marijuana plant but it's not the part that gets you high so you're safe if you are worried about being drug tested you can definitely lecture they definitely recommend you to let your employer know beforehand that you do take CBD or CBD so then you know exactly what's going on and you're not going off by any weird surprises that come your way like I said I thank you guys for watching this video hope you guys enjoyed and like I said let me know down below if you cop any products that I have and thank you for watching hope see you guys in my next one you", "ofOxCNwnx7Y": "first of all it's good Guardian building yo just want to show y'all you know I got my hands on this new your arm saying nothing D like and basically is caught to uh mister this uh what's it called the Apollo horticultural problem son okay now y'all know the body like LED lights I'm a firm believer in LED lights I like that [ __ ] you know do my environment in you know whatever with other reasons I have well I like LED lights and I have used several different LED lights over the past few years okay so I think I can give you all real good analysis on LED lights so the one check [ __ ] out this uh this purple star or a purple sign you don't saying is uh it's supposed to be this new style LED light chip on board Co be so y'all go type that in and you upset LED the NCLB lights and y'all see this this new chip technology and what they try to tell you is you know it supposed to be more powerful and it's supposed to have some type of special cooling chip and it's not supposed to get his height in your tent okay now let me clarify that they line they line in line okay first thing this fan is louder than any other LED that I have your on I'm saying you know it's very very loud so watch this i'ma turn this off y'all listen to how quiet it is what's this lightness right yeah that's how like that fan is you know what I'm saying nonetheless the power from the light outside the loudness you know at its component is y'all dig what I'm saying you know the little loud noise it's worth it you know I'm saying but I'm used to having my LED lights sound like this in my tent I just hear my fans you know I'm saying but nonetheless this light is very good I can't say nothing bad about you know what I'm saying this here is possibly being like close to a 400 watt LED light now in the past I fall honey l need white LED light will cost you you don't saying like fall $500 depending on where you be shopping what particular style LED lights it's you like you know but me personally I live from the [ __ ] so y'all want some LED lights I let me cuz my man makes all these kind of lights at end of the day the old school LED light like this you know what I'm saying the round you up oh nice he said those are really distill the most powerful lights anyway back on point on this purple Sun it's a cool light it works really good you know what I'm saying but 400 watts you know it was like two hundred and thirty dollars or something like that or you can get to half a one you know the half of one IV they got no your solo was you know what I'm saying and the solo was might be like 120 and that's real powerful for a little small a little smaller area you know what I'm saying you license Matt : a powerful now the purple star in the picture was perfect when I turn these lights on it's more like a a fluorescent color you know I'm saying if y'all going eBay in it in other [ __ ] they got other colors so they got real

something like if they have it in their Carter is it reserved er oh hello if you have something in your car is a reserve or can it sell out if you have something in your car and you come out to that one's not yours yet so it is not like reserved for you and all yours is leave I've checked out and seen the confirmation page so people cannot see me like strike out with mix and oranges and bacteria accessories don't do that you're going to pay for shipping rice and that's what's not good and we came to mind order that check out we can't make any changes that's your word about the checkout we can't change things addresses make correct email address and can't use me showing like our warehouses on high alert that tomorrow morning there may be those little borders and they're going to be picking them up like off their printer right away the minute you go through it's your stuff is being handled so make sure these already make sure how to us is right make sure you have the right things in your cart don't check out twice it'll be like somebody compared our Sanders cameras with to get moving it's like my favorite ever but it will be can you show them can't shuttle where babies in the weeklies yeah sometimes make sure the ribbons movie like the colors I think Vincent I'm not gonna computing we're gonna be driving the microphone all right I don't have a thin happy strength weekly because I get away okay have you strike this fuchsia the everyone\u00eds you ship it someone has to see the ribbons and the weekly song SIMON straight it's a green ribbon and then they've got pink ribbon in the watercolor floral mint ribbon on the mint pink ribbon on the x-ray nazy ribbon on the blue top and again on this thin honey start with speech' oh I see a lot of people ask me about which stretchy bands work against which cutter and how would be happy to style before you let me just I guess my opinion and I was that navy blue and everything that's just so let me show you what I think works best now remember you get to when you buy say to you so you're not going to get this one you're gonna get to it so you have options here but on this one here's what for on this one I mean you can't really go wrong but I would say probably the turquoise is my favorite because it picks up the turquoise over and sees in the end in the pattern itself I also kind of like the Navy alright there's title happy strike oh that's hard Navy green any of the match all our colors like are from the same palette so they also you go together this one I would say me for sure I really like this one because if you to extend it right on this one I would say the Navy or those new shows look pretty for really any of marketer but colors are pulled from there on the Navy dot I was angry ooh or the me alright what so many people ask me about shipping rates like how much our shipping rates that's all gonna depend on what you order where its shipping to all that stuff so you will see me shipping rates at checkout but we're going to make you spend $100 more free US ground shipping okay somebody said she's new and she's wondering if happy story is are like signature like if they'll always be here Oh somebody so that she's new and wondered it's happy strike because our signature and we'll always be around yes so happy stripe is our I wanna take me blue like it is it is our signature pattern it's funny like we were talking in our team the other day like why don't you look at so much what is it about it and I think it's because we're so organized minded that it's just the perfect lineup of all of our favorite bright and bold colors so we tried to do great little colors really well and very classic can polish way and strike rule forever and ever be around then happy circle then how many strike was just a fun for about ever but being happy start this one we're here well okay someone keeps asking you making it personalization on the planner but I'm someone is asking if they can get personalization on my mole or in or any of that we used to all the monogramming we do not offer monogram anymore because basically if we can't do things super well I don't our mother gaming machine and like how we were doing it just wasn't working perfectly every time and I wanted to be the one like standing over at doing and every sense it was perfectly lined up and done just right so we dropped that favorite curve and we're happy to refer you to our friends my grandma Darlene linetti she makes really cute stickers that like she sold stickers all kinds things and tons of current monogram options including some that look similar to the monograms and we used to do she's wonderful we love her announcer ever so go and check out her really cute that's a shot all right what else I think you might have ready said this the difference in the academic in the regular just the dates right okay some of us mean the difference between the planners like the academic and a calendar year the only difference between our two are those are the dates other majors so we have academic erudition that runs August through G by the July of this year so twelve months Humber your issues that run June breaking the summer of next year that was launched in September and the only difference okay all right I'm someone I saw someone asks will the Oh rainy be the same color boldest was faster yes it's very bright true bold I also saw some an ass I don't know the exact number but it's this many times and every single one can you enter your credit right ahead of time in your online account no exactly so any plans to restock the epidemic was this year no we will not restock they sell out they're gone will there be in the past will there be enough hats the strength of that is probably not we have a woman every um we make camp effects and they're so cute and we're launching it tomorrow okay [Laughter] these are medical hats they're watching tomorrow as well they're $24 we don't have enough they're so cute and they're so funky and now he resents me this is the back so it's not one of those annoying plastic things it like your ponytail except in Arizona these people are so I got you girl we come over to coffee shop we got plenty of these are Port Authority brand hats which is so really nice for you and yet actually made these for us our team retreat and we love them so much we decided to make them and both get us all them we're gonna sell it without a guarantee we have more coming we also are making grace not perfection in - is there a bundle of just accessories is there a little just accessories no just see these buckles that I've said earlier are the little so no not this okay how much of that max $24 I can tell you about that because they're coming later tomorrow the grace not perfection hats are paint for kind of color heat gold thread and perfection was lettered by our beautiful friend Jessa and high dose of the vibrancy that I find fun baby yeah yeah yeah are we running low on home base by there's like little things about our we were any more home-based miners yes we are running very low on who these miners we have more in production but we should go are we mercury yes we are gonna partner and make designs again I just don't even don't have those tomorrow but I don't see them if I order the weekly bundle tomorrow well like when I get it um that's intense look how fast you ship it to yourself like whatever shipping rate or shipping about that you choose our house is going to be processing orders as fast as they can they know we're gonna have tomorrow my based on price lunches they're fully prepared they're gonna be shipping orders out especially in but because actually you guys give us grace to patients because it's gonna be a busy day and I know that may be working as hard as we can you think I need some pieces okay do the Menino books match the planar covers do the mini notebooks match this manner cutters they don't look there is their gold foil a lots of different signs I suppose some say is the colorful doodle sticker set for ten dollars four pages of the same paper stickers it's a clear in front of the planner yes this will all the have to be available in September can't guarantee it based on when things sell out and how that goes but hopefully we'd be able to choose the desire to work with a bundle or they pre bundled by design no they're not rebuttal so when you go to the bundle tomorrow and you're basically what you'll see is a picture that says customize B and then it over I'm looking at right now on the leg back with another Cyrus II drop them so a drop down for David you click the drop down menu choose drop down dependents click the pendants and you choose and you can see it will build for you below what your

alright thank you guys so much y'all have a wonderful day I will see you tomorrow", "i9RY9rMpWjc": "[Music] Lexx with another video legs with another video I'm here video I'm here hi guys and welcome back to my channel if you're new welcome this is Alexa Marie like some Alexa mridul ex-marine like summary don't forget it you know what I'm saying today I'm going to show you guys how I am going to slay these pop smoke berets okay if you don't know already I'm gonna be talking about puff smoke for the rest of my youtube career because I was literally in love with him he was my favorite rapper of 2019 2018 2020 all the years because he just came with the heat you know I'm here from New York we had nobody we had no one and now we have someone but then someone shot him so so I don't want to go on a rant but just know like this is a hundred percent love like forget the cloud like as soon as I saw this trending I was like no I have to do this for my man's like I really got this my man so what I'm going to do is try to do the pop smoke braids not Kim Kardashian pop smoke braids on my head come on here is on two percent below dry as you can tell and I did use my Revlon blow dryer and it actually worked better this time because I have my hair braided before I just went in on wet hair so I put in less product and did it on kind of like pre stretched hair so if you want to see that review make sure that you click above but yes this is how my hair is looking right now it's very thick it's kind of a lot bigger since I've been wearing wigs and using my special little remedies but yeah just make sure that you're doing this on 100% blow-dried hair it doesn't need to be bone straight but you know the products that you're going to be using are going to make this style so I'm gonna show you what hair I'm gonna use for this style most of it is just leftover hair from other styles that I have but I'm going to show you anyway so these are all the same brand but different types of hair if that makes sense so this is the African collection sensational expressions but it's the long one it's not pre-stretched and then I'm going to be using these two pre-stretch same brand expression hopefully I don't have to use all of it and I can just use these two right here but I've seen a lot of people use a lot of hair so I think I might be using a lot of hair for this style so what I'm going to do is pre part my hair and show you guys exactly what I did and then just get straight into the style because it's very very simple it's literally eight braids on your head so what I'm gonna do is just make a part down the middle and do four parts on either side so I'll explain it once I do it but I gotta do it off camera so again you don't see me on struggling but before I show you the parting and the braids and the end result make sure that you like this video so other ladies can see as well and that you subscribe to my channel if you want more content like this make sure that you comment it down below because I'm not gonna know what you want unless you tell me so yeah let's just get straight into this video alright so I am back and I had to have my mother look at these parts because this is the type of style you do not want to have crazy parts because that's all you're really gonna see so let me see if I can show you how they look you can see they're there they're neat but they're not like how I would do it on my clients but my mom hooked me up and I'm made it a lot better so you know again I'm going to mute myself because I'm gonna watch ozark while I make this video but I am going to try to do a voice over and explain what I'm doing so you guys aren't completely lost but I'm not going to do a step-by-step walkthrough like how I am right now but this is how they look you know but I'll see you guys so I make sure that I pre part my pieces before I just get in straight with my style so I'm just parting it out on a chair that I will show you guys but you know I'm just trying to make sure I have really tiny pieces all the way to somewhat big pieces as you can see right there [Music] [Music] alright so now I'm just gonna go in for my wonderful conditioning gel you know shine and jam that's my jam and then I'm going to go in with my edge booster style factor by ya by edge booster and I'm gonna use the pineapple scent [Music] oh look closely at what I'm doing I'm adding little pieces of hair as I go on the top and then I gradually make the pieces bigger when I get to the bottom so at the end of my hair it looks like a natural like gradient almost and it's a bigger braid at the bottom and a small braid at the top any feat in style like this I'm not going to braid all the way down to the bottom just because I want to make sure that I have enough hair for everything so I just braid until see doesn't it look good but I do braid until at least my shoulder and then I put a rubber band just to you know secure that braid until I finish the ends so now I have half of my head done please ignore the sound of my chair I'm telling you I will invest in a better chair but y'all I already know this is about to be a look because lo look at these frames look at these braids look at these braids who would've thought it pop smoke how to look for my 20/20 so I'm gonna try to show you again how I do it with this part because you can see a little better on this side so I'm just gonna show you like maybe this part and this part I'll try but I'm gonna show you exactly what I do how I feed in the hair so you guys can do this at home so we can all slay maybe slay to be how hot smoke did okay [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I just want to say that these are the Flies braids ever these are the flies great ever so what I'm gonna do right now is I'm going to do my just like touch-ups where I add the mousse you know set my hair and just make sure that looks extra glossy but y'all can't see these arrays let me see in the mirror alright so again you know I'm gonna dip my hair on the ends make sure that they're nice and straight and I'm going to just touch this baby up and my baby hairs cuz I look crazy this step is very important because you want to make sure that all the flyaways are gone this will make and break your look I am telling you right now if your hair is not braided all the way to the end or has flyaways it's gonna look messy and unprofessional so just make sure that you're taking your time on the top of your head on the end of your braids just to make sure that all the flyaways are gone [Music] but you are blow-drying your hair for at least five minutes I was just looking on my phone to make sure you know I was using up the time as much as I could but I use my hair dryer and put it on high just to make sure that all of the moves dried [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] final touches I'm just gonna use my olive oil sheen spray just to make sure my hair is all nice and shiny for you guys and yeah all right so this is the final look I'm telling you like if I was outside if I was outside I'll be slaying old young baby because look at this look at this we'll be channeling war we channeling mob smoke who are we channeling pop smoke oh yes these are not Kim K again these are not Kim K brace array these are pop smoke pop smoke you know Kim K was inspired by pop smoke she was really inspired by the whole black community but she was specifically inspired by the pop smoke all right so this is how the braids came out I ended up only using one pack with the UM with the two things of hair in it like I didn't use that much so I don't know if that's a good thing or bad thing I thought I was gonna use a lot more but you know I didn't want mine to be crazy babe like it doesn't look weird even though it's like not as juicy on the ends but I just didn't want it to look like doodoo braids necessarily cuz his were kind of smooth so I only used about one to two pack of the expressions pre feathered here I'm gonna link it down below let me know how you guys like this look I want I want you to really wear this in

very nice will take a set for pictures yes I'm there right for you they have sent us this which was lovely this is physique ish nice is like a it's a gummy candy and cola bottle love it is very nice if you can see that in camera juice and their ad sense of a pond solve open that's if can't open the fact that oppose video okay I really enjoyed this nothing we've got a little sneaky ass Gordon is blown up again you put it on sale is a bit boy grown-ups is a short we've gone up oh nice red lights down are struggling for the other I do like a strawberry flavored juice and we said blue waffle blue and waffles if that doesn't tell you what it is blue waffle the picture on the label doesn't tell you yeah you're never gonna get remember when you're searching online for it to have safe search on otherwise you might find something yes oh look what I had this conversation I wasn't sure you'd all blue waffle isn't that what a fine no you do not feel like that blue waffle with a juice subprime juices you're just blew off road so just as before if they'll definitely not talkative of which so obviously they're all free mg do it how much would they be full believe they retail between their about that twenty dollar mark that twinkle that's pretty good about 25 light simultaneously move three mg favorite bottle yeah i'm just going to choose this one up a little tiny bit for you you've already got juice in that one that's what he was tasting it's starting to show gonna need a little bit more client for that one okay let's just do the to do so with our first view and that's going to be on the the one that was use a lot of and that is the visitors busy cush okay no what are those to be honest with you yeah is the batteries well allow me to make that attended IDI off for fifa mantra shoes just one for power okay so we're actually gonna start with the strawberry strawberry done nothing yes the favorite hello nuts blown us oh no not very very nice okay well I've already tried it's a side of it i'll have another hit to do know your point 16 homes yeah you know about my mom's man he was yeah first thing i'll say very smooth here very very smooth hit and something you know that I like a lot about premium juice that like takes the nicotine I don't like the harshness that is very very smooth gonna have to have another here called you I mean the strawberry in this one for me is just just early on the side of suit bake but not as bad as I have tasted in some changes but I right exactly means you're nice enough it's in taking away their strawberry milkshake Isom fake know in a way that some lousy juices can be yeah I know what you mean really chlorine and really I mean you just does taste like the strawberry glaze over does it which is a little bit soon taking yourself yeah don't get that much actually boner you get it only after you only it's help you get strawberries on the inhale like you thought we I mean how lots and lots of strawberry need help very Hill don't almost like it don't I suppose just to offset that that topping flavor zone is a nice doughnut you know y dont up a little bit get a big bowl of icing which is what I'm getting is like nothing wrong it's really nice so that is number one I think yes it's so so we'll probably go into small when we get to review bits but certainly straight off the off the bat with that one it's more heavily lean towards one flavor of the day on which is strawberry than ever just give you a quick a quick taste of the couch resume after oh I pay yet do we wait for the third or change audios will [ __ ] that in there so it's off if we add the strawberry blown up we had that on the goon like the a in this time we've got you're this is a weird one this is the RDA that came with my Rome make it is a really weird rd i'll talk about me these things to help it's a lovely idea who's he was in good condition yes it's so weird pub talk about out of time what about Adam review you know this one's exactly the same point one point one six and still firing at 90 of course this is the fizzy fizzy couch which is a Cola bottle gummy candy physical a ball don't get colder I just get sweet gummy goodness i get these okay entice cut not only actually pretty stale how can I can taste o them but i grieve you on the on the inhale not only in ease I think my favorite afraid it's just so I'll see once I'm tasted all free it's just sweet gummy goodness is that physique ish yeah you clearly had some time with this one's up dis agree with your your sort of review of it it's if you want and I tell you what it has got quite like that a lot of these fizzy feel like or or soda drink replicants don't have is that fizzy fizzy flavor that's got a little something there is a little bit fees again nobody color gummy it's hard to pin is hard to describe this flavor that is a very rounded gummy oh yeah how do we fizzies sweet it's lovely my opinion is ugly but that's the two okay so we're just going to do a little fade away by weary week and okay so we're back we've reworked what we going now then now the last one is I'm going to do something right now okay is the blue blue waffle okay now this is interesting because I've tried a lot of blueberry waffle was a lot of Ruby plant pancakes in there now I had one recently there was a blueberry waffle really didn't like it was that livery pancake sorry I really didn't like it I'll have to go get the brand name for you but I felt that the the flavor had almost as a horrible off the types of a horrible horrible aftertaste and very little blueberry coming out of it that one name let's give this a go d okay so it's something about waffle and pancake flavors that leaves an aftertaste and I'm not sure the blue beyond that is strong enough yes I know in the world don't think you want it to I personally don't I line up if anything this could be a little tummy tuck sweet for me this is this one by me is it very much in a realm valve pancake man and French dude it's almost like a bit of both that's what I expect if you poured half pancake man how folks dude into a bowl of a pond it I don't need be many miles off there also I don't think it'd be a mini more so because of that and because I like those too and that range of flavors yeah I like this one I don't know my D yes so that is getting don't get that blueberry that you're probably as much as it should go along this is very nice again all the research is a very nice in my opinion there as a range of juices it's nice to say you free if Thornton then I mean a physique rucha short with a waffle they could have just one struggle donut waffle and another KP but they didn't mess with a gummy exactly it's split this weighing job I would have liked maybe to bring out if you look throughout forth to maybe go fruit because then you've got Froome James a handy you've got cake exact coupled all your goals you've got some beautiful bases covered here and we often find with juices as well we get the layup six juices in the line but there's only really three ya found out for you there's always lots of carrying or something like that and I think you're right again but while you've obviously spent some time with these juices I don't think it's a good thing because she say I find they change flavors wellness over time and they were really good juices which is always nice to do when we've done some reviews before where there's not been a nice yeah I would have a little taste of that remind yourself there's a scores on of those farmers easy all my scores of those family up here whatever little rundown okay so out of the free Matt tell me scores which one which one i deferred from well it the fish would be the one for me fees obtained that bowl to a car show I know you weren't sure of when we were filming this they'll had it for a week and I was just obvious the meaning of God I'll get a larger view is all about to do but I just complete down I kept tripping on the ID on me make yeah I've got a tasteful yeah I couldn't follow up hoochie could not find the juice illusion on the bay real energy so i keep going back to another one more chip got to bomb a bomb ass it's my haha take this need some of you is here needs to be some left that is high praise indeed in me so that is going to be for the first one which is that frizzy fish hmm i'm gonna give the physique fish and I ok I really like it really really like it's the kind of juice that I can definitely see me going and I'm sure I would easily be sold that in a shop if I will take the dive you probably would not be sold it in a shop because every time I go into a shop they've got the other two and I'm low that one photo make sense both my local friends in boat shop something in there this is talking soon as you do spin around in their chatter away absolutely so if you're not getting the fizzy fishes right now sold out I'm it's a different shop look at me no I've got the other two but I've sold out I'm all there you go that's not plays and it's making me on the phone graph to I really like it and I think you've been a bit under stayed in your school and I think it deserves a high school so I'm gonna give it a nine just we get a point five on that one we do so I point fire for the fizzy fish so now this tool this tool store would go nuts blown us blow up again I'll really like that one I'm big fan of strawberries we as you know from my videos I like to go find school yes they know it's not sort of milkshakes will be doughnut you don't get a lot don't know he's my strawberry the strawberry flavor is very nice served as you said it's a nice mixture the kind of real story juices and sim fake it took it's a bit mixture between 2-4 that I think I wonder score at seven and a half wasn't 74c it's at seven per case and we get 7.25 overall so we're just we'll run that down a little bit because we haven't spent as long with it as food wise was the fear so it could change a bit going to seven give it a solid seven and so it's seven and eight point five or so like let's talk waffles now a reminder I think of no I'm pretty min i'll have a reminder whose line is a mile no i'm not gonna say no to it it's not my favorite of the first it's my least favorite the free but not by a country mile i would have preferred a stronger boo boo taste and it's really something officer otherwise it does fall into the same realms of tasting very similar to most other waffles and pancakes we have their popular for a reason they're nice I just want something a little bit differently from the brand so for that ways i'm gonna give you six and a half six now i think i agree with you on that one so for the sub lime juices yeah gonna sub on juice line we're going in a single day where we go we got on that yep 8.57 and a 6.5 for the waffles so if you're out and about you know your stomach bug nuts i was hoping if you see fizzy commercials i would buy it before somebody else beat you to it yes the do stuff like this stuff is is paying you now hayes east I mean oh I'm definitely that one jealous that you've had our ball I'm now going on buddy I'm gonna have to hit yep so the winner at the three is the physique ish but it all banging sub lime juice is enough this picture Ella yeah alright for hooking for the hook up in the first place yeah and that's that you should be for the suburb juice line there's only two things left in 3d and that is of course if you can't guess the double byte taking cloudy people", "dgVzE9nxxkM": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] hi friends i'm back with a new video and this is a very beautiful cover up and i hope you will love it it's very beautiful it's striped from the back up to the front and you can wear it as an everyday wear or a beach wear or whatever you want it's really beautiful i love it i tried this once moving a bit to the market and i really appreciated it so we have our tools here for today we are going to use robinian and we are not going to double our strands this time and for our project this time we need a 3.5 millimeter crochet work and you're not going to double our strands it's just a single strand that we use so we are going to start with our foundation chain of 355 chains long so [Music] make sure you chain from your knee to your shoulder twice so those are like double so these are multiples of five make sure you have 355 chains so when you have that with you you add two more chains like one two so after adding you're going to skip the very first chain and make a single crochet so that's how it started so from there you chain one two three four five so when you have five chains you're going to count five chains from down from the chain line and then you make a single crochet so count five and make a single crochet in the very fifth chain so count one two three four five and when you have five chains with you you're going to count from down right here one two three four five single crochet just like this chain one two three four five and you count from there one two three four five make a single crochet so continue chaining five and you make a single crochet on the fifth stitch or chain so i have this so far and that is the first row and i'm remaining with five chains so in the very last chain you're going to make a single crochet like this chain one and you turn your work so in that in that single crochet you made previously you're going to make another single crochet and then you chain five so this is what you are going to do for the second row you're going to chain five and you make a single crochet in that space which is the very middle and it it forms that mesh so continue chaining five and make a single crochet so this is very easy you don't have to look for a stitch or a chain to make your single crochet on like for the previous row for that very first row you just have to chain five and make a single crochet so there five you make a single crochet one two three four five and make a single crochet one two three four five make a single crochet so you're going to do this until that row is finished and i'll let you know what to do next when you're with the very last stitch i'll show you what to do so this is how your work should look like so far so here i am i've finished my row and i'm going to actually finish it with two chains and since the stitch is done so i'll have to make a double crochet so make a double crochet you can see the stitch is done and i cannot make a single crochet in that part so make a double crochet here so when you have this you see it rhyming with the whole row if you try to make a single crochet it will look different it will make it go down so when you make a double crochet chain one you turn your work and then continue with the procedure of chaining five and you make a double crochet in the next bit so make sure you know to double crochet a single crochet right there chain five make a single crochet for this whole row until the row is done and you can just determine that when there is ending you can determine that it needs a single crochet or a double crochet at the end so just do that very simple very easy this button is very easy and it's really easy and this inspired me a lot to make it as a cover up a mesh very beautiful so i've reached my end and here you can see i can just make a single crochet here does not call for a double crochet so i hope you can tell the difference that this needs a single crochet at the end and this need a double crochet at the end so that code for a single crochet so you you chain one and turn your work then make a double crochet and then continue so whenever you finish you up you chain one and then you make a single crochet other stat and then you start chaining five and continue so you're going to do this and finish up this row and it's very easy just keep doing this until you have enough fruits and those enough roots are going to [Music] be eight species so if you're to count in rows there will be 16 rows and those are eight spaces so you can't like this so you're just going to count one two those are two spaces so make sure that eight spaces in number so add more six sorry six more spaces to make eight rows so we have our eight we have uh eight spaces yes sorry we have eight spaces and those are 16 rows so we finished it with a double crochet you chain one and then tighten your up and cut it so now we are going to add a different color the next color which i'm using is navy blue and the first one was cream so now i'm going to use navy blue and for the navy blue i'll only need six for the navy blue i only need four spaces not six and when you stretch this these eight spaces will be about nine inches which is which becomes really low it's really long so i'm going to count with you one two three four five six seven eight so those are eight spaces which are eight rows sorry sixteen rows so let me measure with you how long this is so when you're measuring it this way for my tape measure my top measure becomes short for it so it's easier if you double it you double your work and then you measure it normally your you get the measurement easily but i just want to show you how it will look like so i've reached 60 inches and still it's still longer so i'm going to i'm just going to add more to that so that we find the the right measurements but the easier way is to double your work and then measure so those are plus 11 making 71 inches long so they're really low it's really very long so remember there are 355 chains plus two so it's a very long chain and this measures from your knee from the front knee to the back knee i hope it's not wrong so we're going to go to our next color and it's just a reminder please subscribe for more videos like this so we are going to start with our new our next color opinion and it's never blue so you're going to join it like this and then a chain one just to make it firm you not count it and add my one chain and then turn your work and start making a single crochet as we've been doing for the rest of the rows chain five and then make a single crochet in the next the next piece make a single crochet in that space chain one two three four five then make a single crochet in that space one two three four five single crochet in the space so you're going to do this it's going to be the same as we've been doing for the previous rows until you have eight rows under the six spaces so i've made mine and this is how you do it you make white maybe blue white and you end with every blue so for the navy blue you make you make 4.5 sorry for the weight you'll make 4.5 inches and then for the navy blue you'll make two point it's about five inches about 2.5 inches so just the same make sure the for the weight there are eight spaces which are 16 rows and for the navy blue there are eight rays so i'm going to measure with you this is one piece when you measure it with a tape measure you'll get 23.5 inches that's when you stretch it you get 23.5 inches so make another piece just like this and then we are going to connect from the back together we are going to connect from the back and for the front we shall leave it just like that because that's where our front bun will b so let's measure this together as you continue crocheting you realize it becomes shorter so i've doubled my my work that's the very first piece i made with you so i've doubled it and i'm going to measure it while doubling and mine measures about 32.5 and this this is this is about 70 sorry 65 yeah 65 inches long so you're going to measure for the arm for the arm they're supposed to be 10 inches so this this is the space for her arm when you train when you fold your work together um count 10 spaces and then you mark it off i've used a different color of yarn since i don't have a stitch marker with me here you can use a different color of yarn if you don't have it with you for a stitch marker and you can use a stitch marker if you have it so now we are going to work on the back and that back is where we are going to join our two pieces together so we are going to join from down to halfway so join it halfway um to be safe you can mark it off just like this after folding your work into two just folding one piece again the other piece and then you mark them you mark it off and then for the other side you mark it off as well and now we are going to join our work while making meshes in the middle and this will not show anything it will not show any joining so you just have to start up by getting your yarn through there right here and then you chain one just to make it firm so you're going to start by chaining one and then you make a single crochet so when you have that you're going to add one two and then you connect to that that is the other piece so this is one piece to another piece so you connect one side together of two different pieces of work and then you slip stitch and when you slip stitch you add two two chains and and you make a single crochet so i realized to change to chain sorry two chains a shirt so i've decided to make them three so those are three chains before joining but for the rest of the chains will be only two so this should not confuse you so chain one two and then you connect to the other side with a single crochet in the space right in that space which is the next piece you're going to make a single crochet just like this right over like that and then you continue you chain only two not three so chain one two in this piece this side you're going to make a single crochet one two in the other piece you're going to make a single crochet so just do this keep on doing this until that half way is finished so do that until it's done and i'll guide you through so i've made this a little bit long i've made the video a little bit long so that you can get what to do here not to be confused so so for this pet let me take this opportunity to thank all those who have been supporting me and thank you everyone and thank you for appreciating my video and if you love it please don't forget to give it a big thumb up and if you have not yet subscribed please remember to subscribe and don't forget to hit that bell so that you get notified whenever there's a new video thank you so much so i've made this and just to show you this is how it will look exactly like this you realize it shows nothing that is connected from here or there so just do that and you will appreciate the work you're doing as well so this is how it is you're going to do this until your marked area and this is where i've marked mine right there so i'm done and remember you've done it only halfway the other way you're leaving the other side of the piece of the two pieces you have to leave half of them out without tampering with them because those will be our front panel so when you reach here you're going to chain one and then you cut the end so let me remove the then and you see how it looks like so this is how it is and this is going to be our neck area so that's how it is so this is going to be our front pad and for our front part we are going to use white for making the front bun it's going to be like a bun so just to line out our work that's how we are going to do it so start by chaining one and make it firm just for making your work stand before and then you chain two and turn your work so when you reach here you're going to make a double crochet in that space and again another and then the third one and that will be all so you've started with two double crochets and that plus the chain will make it three so those will be three then for that for the next piece you make four double crochets in the space so that's one two three and four so you have four double crochets for one space and you go to the next make one two three and four so those are four double crochets so that's what you're going to do you make four double crochets in every space until that whole row is done so this is the first row of the front the front outline which is like a band so make it until you're done with each and every space so just a reminder this is the the half part that we left out we worked on half we joined one we joined the half and the remaining half is that front part that now we are working on so i've made really long one so make sure you make like this and make it all over from here allow it to the neck and then here i am i've made my whole row is done so you make also three so you're going to make two in the in the in that space so you can make three but i decided to make two curls i just wanted this but if you want three as you started with three it's a choice so make three or two so for my case i've made two one in the space and the last one in the stitch so make that and then yeah let me show you so that's how it is and now we are on the lower part of the work so you're going to chain one two and then you turn your work so now we are going to start on our front post that's how we make it then back post so this is all you do front post you push your hook from the front to the back pulling forward through the hook and then make a double crochet so that is a front post and for the back first you're going to push your hook from the back and then get the hand from the front just like that and then [Music] you go on with your front and back post so for this part of explaining the front and back post i'm not so good at it so you can you can get that maybe maybe by watching it i'm not good at explaining it i'm so sorry for that so make your front and back post and when you're done you're going to [Music] you're going to continue together so that you don't

review from Green Man II thick woods um got the whole you know druid kinda you know feel going on pretty good our work on his website there and have one more liquid from Green Man need use that I'd like to review this is a blue Marcy oh this is an interesting name before I reviewed paladin punch and druids breath so this is blue Marcy well smellin cocoa again and a berry well okay guys got my trusty BAM and my a 7 another a7 rebuildable we're going to try some green man blue Marcie this again is 70 PG 30 bg-12 milligram Nick and let's see what blue Marci is all about here we go ooh that's very interesting it's like a mint chocolate chip but there's a very in there excellent throat hit decent vapor production for being 70 30 with stout on the PG it's a very good throat hit um it really feels more like 18 then 12 but I know it's 12 milligram I think that's because of the high PG content it's a blueberry mint chocolate chip it doesn't sound like it would work but it's actually very good mom yeah that's what it is guys blue Marci is a blueberry mint chocolate chip and it's actually the fav the favor one of mine out of the three that I've tried so far everyone I try keeps getting a little better and better I have to get a few more these were given to me for the purpose of review and not bad at all I'm actually quite impressed Green Man II juice blue Marci mint chocolate chip kind of flavor guys I'm vadik vapor from the forums thanks a lot for watching and as always keep on David", "lhmShvDLBT4": "hey guys it's Brenda and welcome back to another video in sugar pink DIY and in today's video we'll be decorating to know the books for this back-to-school season so don't forget to Like subscribe and hit the bell so you want to miss any of my videos and now let's go on to the video alrighty guys so to start off prep your notebook cover with some white thick paper kinda like poster board paper and with some liquid masking tape start making all of your designs in this case I'm using a liquid masking tape marker and this is so much easier easier than using a masking tape that comes like in a bottle cuz then you have to use like a brush to do all of your designs instead of like using like a regular marker like I am and once I had my mandalas done I continued to write my phrase in this case it's time for a break so I did everything in cursive and then I went back and then just kind of like added some thick strokes to make the fake lettering and once the masking tape is all dried I continued to do like other designs with my watercolor so just adding random colors all over the place all over my notebook just to make it look real super pretty and super popping to the eye so I just added all the colors that come with my palette of course only the bright ones but of course you can use any colors or any color combination that you like and then once my watercolor was all dried I continue to peel of the masking tape so basically everything that I drew or brought with my masking tape will turn white once I peel the masking tape off and then Mikey D jumped on my table started looking and smelling at everything that I had on my table and stopped me from recording [Music] and once Makita left i started to remove all the masking tape that I still had on my notebook cover so once the masking tape was all peeled off from my notebook cover i took my black pen and started outlining every single design that I drew with my masking tape and this way all of my white designs and drawings look super vibrant and super popping and I don't know but I feel like it's super relaxing outlining everything so for the second notebook cover we're also gonna end up having some white small designs so your notebooks look super cute and so for this you can also use like a masking tape liquid marker that I use previously or you could use a crayon just like I am and with the white crayon just make all of your designs and once your designs are all done start painting it with some watercolor and since watercolor is water-based and crayons are oil-based oil and water they do not go well together so everything that he colored with your white crayon will remain white it just like this so you can basically draw or design anything that you want so from my case I decided to do a pink pineapple instead of the regular yellow pineapple so I just edit a bunch of pink all over the place so I basically used all the pink colors that come in my water color palette and so on this side I just added a little bit of shading by adding more of that darker pink just to make my pineapple more cute and more attractive to look at so while my pineapple dries I took this small piece of vinyl or like paper that has like a bunch of glue or sticky back and so on the backside I drew like all the leaves from a pineapple and then I basically just cut them out so basically with this kind of paper you can make any design or any cute stickers that you want and put them on any surface so then I cut them out and then I just peeled the white paper from the back and then just put it onto my notebook just like this and you can find this kind of paper at craft stores or office supply stores honestly they're super cute there are some that have a bunch of glitter otherwise there's also some that have like a mirror effect to them and some that have a bunch of texture and once in my designs were all done and it's time to write a cute phrase on my notebook so I wrote the free slice is better with pineapples so I basically wrote the phrase or the part life is better in tall letters and super thin as well and then for the second part so the word with I wrote it in capital letters as well but a lot smaller from the ones that I already wrote as you can see right here and then I just decorated with two small lines one on each side and for the word pineapple I made it in cursive and I wrote it in black oil blue ink just like this and then in swim back and like made a bolder just to make it more puffy and once your notebooks are all done they should look like this [Music] I read guess and this was it for today's idea don't forget to Like subscribe and to bail so you won't miss any of my videos and see you on the following video for another idea on how to decorate your notebooks for this back to school bye guys [Music]", "swqQ5Xe57xc": "smash shoot 18

notice size of leaves they're doing great okay all my corns it off - they doing great these three are like the way that's the strain usually grows that one it is weird it's like shorten took off like these big old heads and stuff start going off of this look that one's just topped well yeah cannabis is medicine for real thank you guys for letting me show this is why right now he eats", "e5_B8K5nk2U": "loja brothers and sisters welcome back to the channel it's your friend came back to do another review for y'all today got something interesting for all you cannabis enthusiasts and connoisseurs out there we've got a pax era pod for the old packs era coming from Soleil it's Salette unplugged this is a hybrid strain that's coming in at six hundred and seventy three milligrams THC and ninety seven point three one milligrams CBD so it's hitting about seven sixty seven percent THC in about nine percent maybe ten percent CBD not much yeah I've tried this before and flower from Soleil it's always been pretty satisfying before it's their version of rock star cush unplug so really eager to try it out in a packs air pod it's 0.5 gram pod it's like a 510 threaded cart but you use it for the packs Eric comes in these little pods like this and you just put it on there and away you go works a lot like a jewel like a jewel nicotine device just like an e-cigarette same thing same device same idea in fact it's the same company jewel started out as pax labs and broke off into jewel so pretty innovative product pretty cool I haven't seen a lot of these around really wanted to try it out ever since bought my pax era down when I was in Oregon tried a whole bunch of pods out down there in Washington love the thing been really eager for it to show up in Canada and finally I got my hand on a few of these pots so we're gonna check this one out today I just want to show you on the side here it shows that it's a hundred percent plant-based ingredients so any added terpenes are plant-based and not artificial so it's good to know that it's a bit of a unique package here let me just also show you here at the packaging date is December 5th 2019 so it is what June 3rd so it's been sitting around for a little while but it should be okay I think yeah it's an area company so a the one oh yes what I wanted to show you was packaged it's it's unique it's weird so it says here push finger through circle then push and hold the inner tab firmly in continue holding tab pull and flap to open like there's a little bit complicated here for something that is a pod that's about this big let's check it out so tells us to push here alright and hold tab in and pull huh I don't understand so you hold this in and you pull this part out it's not very easy to open so push finger through help push and hold the inner tab firmly in hmm very strange packaging design here by some way we're just gonna rip it open cuz this is nuts nice job alright so once you get inside this insanely labyrinthine nutso packaging here completely unnecessary by the way oh you get your little slave packs pod so there you go it's got the THC logo on there as you're all used to assess branded with so late um doesn't say unplug anywhere on there you can see this is what the oil looks like in these packs air pods it doesn't look like a lot but there's 0.5 grams in there and I've had these before they're pretty concentrated they're pretty good the ones I've had before so all you do is you take this off you're not if you have one on take your packs error make sure it's fully charged take it just like a jewel device put it on there you go it lights up it's ready to go um you know unfortunately I would love to show you the app that goes with this but it's really not set up for the Canadian market yet what a cool feature on this is you can go in here and you can look for the pod that you've bought choose it and select certain temperatures it's not set up for Canada at all yet it only shows states in the United States where it's illegal and in fact even searching for Canadian LPS or any products comes up with no result it's really disappointing that you know the releasing packs pause in the Canadian market and their app isn't even set up for it yet because it is a pretty cool app I've used it for the American pods before it comes with sort of preset temperatures for each pod for best flavor best vapor it's kind of cool neat little temp temperature settings in there kind of cool um I just got it set to sort of a basic temperature right now I actually can't remember what temperature the last pod was but we're just gonna rip on this and see what it's like straight out of the box right into the pack Sara whoa Wow dad there's a lot of taste going on here it's very fruity uh first thought when I inhaled this and took a drag with fruity pebbles this tastes like fruity pebbles there's a lot of flavors going on there I'm very fruity probably one of the most flavorful cartridges or pods that I've had Wow I know it's Rockstar cush is what this strain it's their version of Rockstar cush I've never got a fruity pebbles taste from Rockstar cush before but while I'm really enjoying this taste very fruity very yummy yeah first impressions on the taste very good nice and smooth very smooth packs air pod like I said just like a jewel pod it's gonna last a little while but we're gonna get back to that because of course as always I'm gonna be smoking this over the next couple days gonna come back and finish up the review gonna let you know my final thoughts and let you know what to think about the soleil unplug pax air pop alright so after vaping this pack Sarah Soleil unplugged pod the last couple of weeks got some thoughts for you um I really like this pod the flavor is still there mmm it's a fruity pay the fruity pebbles flavor I really love it very fruity very flavorful I love it the flavor is lasted throughout the whole pod as you can see I've been vaping a lot of this here it's getting down to the nitty gritty they're not too heck of a lot left as it looks but looks can be deceiving with these packs air pods a little bit goes a long way in there as you can see it's not a very big pot to begin with but it does last quite a while I've been ripping on this quite a bit almost like a jewel going a little overboard that's one thing I'll be careful with these things so you know standard use it's gonna last you quite a long time never got plugged up once always nice and clear always a good vapor never harsh like I said unfortunately the apps not working in Canada packs get your act together get this app working in Canada so there's no settings for it I did find a similar pod an American pod I've got it vaping at about five hundred and six degrees those curious out there with the temple eyes and you know it produced a really good flavor really good vapor for the Sun lay on plug like I said the flavor last the throat the effects you get off it it's a little bit mild it's it's really it's happiness it's happiness strain you feel really good you feel happy you feel mellow just feel relaxed like you're floating along like I said there's days when I really ripped on this a lot and get a little foggy great you know it's not really energetic go get a lot of important things done kind of strain but you're gonna be coast and throughout the day and just feeling really happy real conversational real mellow I really like the buzz you get off this it's not super strong like I say you have like three four drags it's kind of a mild effect overall but you do notice it and you just feel really good you can't help but keep smiling I like this thing a lot great job so lay on the taste great job sway on the effects great job on everything except the packaging that packaging was ridiculous get better packaging packs fix your app get it working for the Canadian market because it's a really cool app and I'd really love to use it so it all of us here so get it working for us the price is good we'd love to see it be cheaper it's 45 bucks approximately for one of these pods really like to see the price come down but I really like to see all the prices come down so that's Universal but for what you're gonna get 45 bucks it's comparable to about a 5-10 thread cartridge there's also point five grams lasts about the same amount of time and I got to tell you packs air pods in my experience a pretty potent really good stuff so my review is overwhelmingly glowing I'd say thumbs up find yourself with a pax era device definitely seek out these pods you will not be disappointed thanks for watching hope you all found it informative if you've tried this before you agree with me if think I'm right think I'm wrong whatever the hell is on your mind leave me a comment I like to read them all I replied every one of them while you're here click Subscribe I do videos all the time I like to make new

"yTAsyeXLvN8": "how's it going up so this is one of my first videos I just decided that I was going to do a review on what I just got in the mail yesterday it is the totally wicked e Nick Titan 5 10 everybody seems to have a 5-10 of some sort of great product I just got mine yesterday a little back story I've got a friend living in Florida I'm in Texas known the guy for 15 years great guy we both started smoking around the same time we were 15 16 years old 17 something like that don't remember a long time we like I said we both started smoking been smoking the entire time I quit for a little while he quit for a little while but we eventually started smoking again with that being said I see that he made a post on Facebook about the fact that he had quit smoking with the help of this product I'd heard about it but I wasn't a believer I did not know anything about it two weeks later she posted again saying that he had not smoked a cigarette in two weeks now this guy he smokes a bit more than me I smoked half a back to a pack a day depending on the day the situation so on so forth he was a constant smoker he smoked about one and a half two packs a day and for him to tell me that he hadn't smoked one cigarette in two weeks because of this product I was extremely impressed extremely impressed to say the least so with that being said I ordered one now I ordered mine from totally wicked he being lucky person that he is actually lives and works in the area we're totally wicked has their shop he walks into their shop buys their stuff all the time loves it he turned me on to him I love him there like I said I got mine yesterday instantly started trying stuff now when I ordered mine as most of you know the kit it comes with two batteries to atomisers pin cartridges the charger and the charger cable okay now being a newbie or whatever you want to call it I opened the bottle with the carts and instantly put a card on it I didn't bother charging it I just wanted to see what it was about okay with that being said the carts that come with it are bad they are not very good at all even the high milligram one that comes in the bottle tastes like you're smoking an ultra-light cheap cigarette and it comes with high medium low and a no nicotine cartridge which I guess if you're trying to stop smoking completely this is a great kit you start on the highest they last you awhile you drop down you drop down and you eventually go to no nicotine you still have the flavor don't get it twisted you still have the flavoring and it's wonderful only not in the cards to come with the pack so with that being said I knew this already because of my friend that lives in Florida and he said when you order your pack go ahead and just instantly order the marlboro liquid so that's what I did i order the marlboro red medium strength liquid I got the 10 milliliter bottle at eleven milligrams because I didn't know what I was getting into I with that being said I would have gotten a little bit stronger but being a newbie hey it happens so I'm happy with this very happy so I also at the time of ordering all of this I also went on to a website called juicy vapor calm and ordered a trial pack of three milliliter bottles I ordered the coconut I ordered cherry vanilla Cola Kona coffee and orange creamsicle yes orange creamsicle I instantly because once again I already knew a little insight into this from watching videos and from talking to my friend I started emptying the carts that came out of the bottle rinse them out real good jab him off with a paper towel and started loading my flavors and of course the go to Marlboro into the carts so out of all of these I have tried so far I have tried the vanilla Cola it was good by itself very good product by itself then on top of that I put a couple of drops of the cherry which made it even better even better yes so I baked on that for a while loved it loved it loved it so with that in the one of the cartridges I also had the second atomizer that comes with the kit and the cart filled with the Marlboro so I switched back and forth just to you know I'm trying it out what can I say got another cartridge filled it with the orange creamsicle now on top of getting all the flavors in from juicy vapor I tried after the orange creamsicle i tried to kona coffee on top of the Kona coffee which I baked this morning when I got up I loaded it like it was a cup of coffee and it was good it's it's a little weak for me I could have used a little more coffee flavoring to say the least but it was good it was good just add a little I added some coconut to it now that brought out the flavor of both the coconut and the coffee it you could taste the coconut and you can taste the coffee and it did exactly what it was supposed to do and brought out the flavor in both so I'm very happy with that that's actually what I have mixed up in this cartridge right here that I'm you know I'm saving it off to the side I've got so far I've got three cartridges loaded I've got the coffee and the coconut I've got the orange creamsicle I'm sorry the orange creamsicle and I've got the Marlboro to go to tobacco and I probably mix all of these together in odd combinations at some point but right now it's perfect the way it is okay on top of getting all of this in from totally wicked and from juicy vapor they came in the same day I ordered on on last friday and they showed up on wednesday yes wednesday and i was growing impatient i was ready to go but in the meantime walks a lot of YouTube videos and to all of you guys out there that are making videos you're doing a great job I learned a lot and thoroughly enjoyed watching this so from some of those videos I learned how to mix my own what it takes what you have to get so on and so forth so sunday i went to michaels which is a hobby shop hobby store i'm sure they're nationwide but i went to my local one here and the lady there told me that they did not sell lauren oils they did have some wilson oils but they only had four flavors they came in a little package and none of the flavors I really cared for so she said to go to hobby lobby which I know Hobby Lobby everybody knows Hobby Lobby that's where they sell Lauren oils servants on Monday night and I picked up six different ones i picked up the cherry so i've got cherry I've got better rum I got raspberry cinnamon root beer and the one that I cannot wait to try it is called English toffee I can't imagine how good that will be but I can't wait so on top of that on top of all of those flavors i also bought the glycerine wilton glycerin everybody recommends that everybody's talking about it I haven't found any PG yet of course I haven't gone looking that hard I probably end up ordering that online just a couple other things that I got I got through little droppers they were right beside the Loran oils so little droppers those who come in handy and i also got where I I also found some little bottles now these these I found in the paint department at hobby lobby they are some sort of fine line painting bottle or something that come with these little I don't know if you can see them these little needle things which those will get thrown away i'm guessing i don't see the point knows that three bottles they cost like a dollar for three bottles I don't know what size they are as far as milliliters but I'm not really concerned because I'm going to be mixing my own to my personal preference anyway just as the first video so far initial impressions with the wicked 510 Enoch lovey loving it loving it also I guess you guys are probably wondering why did this guy get the red one let me explain why I got the red one not my first choice but I'm a frugal guy I don't like spending a lot of money on hardly anything and with this being my first one and not knowing how I was going to do with it or if I was just going to wind up getting rid of it at some point and going back to a normal cigarette I got the red one because when i looked online the normal price of this totally wicked box full of goodies is sixty dollars 5999 5995 something like that but they were running a special on the red ones the gold ones the pink ones and I can't remember which other one I think there was one other one but I can't remember which one it was the gold one was priced out at fifty dollars now the red one and the pink one or 4495 so rather than paying the 64 say a black one or a platinum I opted for the $45 red one it works the same as the other ones and i'm not vain I don't care what color it is so that's why I got the red one if anybody was wondering so I'm going to make some stuff up I'm going to test every product out that I got probably go and find some PG or order some and I might up the strength on the marlborough just because I'll probably wind up using this as a base for some of the flavoring and that will cut it even more than I really want it to be so i'll probably left the milligram strength on that and we'll see how it goes thanks for watching guys", "F7DUPknX5zM": "hi guys so today I'm gonna be reading my followers unpopular opinions so I asked you guys on my Instagram to give me specifically your unpopular opinions and I got a lot so I'm gonna be sharing them with you today and I may or may not tell you if I agree or disagree with them so for this week's post certifications shout out thank you so so much for turning my personification I really appreciate it and if you would like a shout out in my next video just subscribe down below top the notification belt and then tell me down below once that is done okay so the first unpopular opinion is anime is not that good and anime is very very bad it's like I've tried to watch anime a lot of times I could never really get into it I don't know if I would say very very bad but it's definitely not for me but I can see how some people like it or love it so yeah I kind of I kind of agree with that okay so the next unpopular opinion is you know the very popular unpopular opinion it's pineapple is good on pizza honestly pineapple has moods like put on pizza for like years and now people are suddenly like whoa no pineapple cannot go on pizza like I mean I like it it's not my favorite it keeps the topping but I'm fine with it I'll eat pineapple and pizza I don't know why it's so controversial I don't know why it's a big deal but yeah I agree it's good and then someone said mayo on pizza is quite good I've never tried that before I don't think I would really like it because it's Mayo I mean I like Mayo but I'm keep said I don't know if that would be good um so I don't really agree with that but I've never really tried it so and then someone else said necessities should be free and I do agree with that one that's definitely one that I agree with I think a lot of people agree with that one and the next one is Harry Styles is ugly so I did go through a One Direction phase when I was younger um I don't think Harry Styles was ever my favorite I definitely had a crush on some of the other ones but the ones that I never had a crush on were Niall and Harry and I don't think he's ugly I don't think he's ugly but I don't really like him that much I do think he's a little like overrated maybe I think he was more aberrated back then so the next one is poop and fart jokes are unfunny and lazy comedy yeah it is much it is very lazy like but for some reason I still do laugh at some I mean it depends like I still I can help but I laugh but I do get it it was kind of lazy and I can see how like there are better jokes there just kind of old someone else said pickles and chocolate tastes good together that doesn't sound good but I'll take your word for it so the next one says pandas should go extinct I mean they're kind of cute so I don't think they should go extinct but sure that can be you're unpopular thank you the next one is cucumbers tastes super good I do agree with that I love cucumbers so much I love a lot of green vegetables I do love love cucumbers I also really like broccoli I don't know why everyone hates it someone else said tik-tok is kind of getting old and they said I miss tik-tok from last summer so I was a really on tick-tock last summer any time around then I kind of just started getting into it because for a while I was like what the hell is this tick-tock thing why why did they change it from musically like musically was like my thing when I was younger I made like a thousand musical E's and then I tried to find my old account on tick tock and it was not there and I was just like when I first like you know started hearing about tick tock I was like kind of like cringe but I'm kind of starting to get into it like they're just like so many different accounts and so many different kinds of people on there and you know I found some really cool people that I want to follow so I don't think I can really agree or disagree with this the next unpopular opinion is talkies are better than hot cheetos I don't think I've ever tried talking I do really like hot cheetos so the next one is iceland is fake I don't know where you got that idea from country you it's so the next one is white privilege doesn't exist and this came from a black person apparently I don't agree with this I definitely know that white privilege exists so I like strongly disagree with this I want to see your reasoning the next one is movie marathons are not fun I mean it depends I really like the movies then yeah but everybody have to be more a little bit more specific with that like I guess if it goes on forever it's like huh I can hardly sit down and watch one movie to be honest my attentions man is kind of short so the next unpopular opinion is salt and vinegar chips are gross I like so every learner chips they're not my favorite chip flavor but I can see how some people would think they're gross I don't exactly like vinegar but for some reason I like the chip flavor but it's not my favorite so I kind of agree the next unpopular opinion is Hamilton is not the best musical Oh Hamilton is the only like professional musical that I've seen like official musical I saw it in London and it was literally amazing I don't really have anything to compare it to I just seem like smaller productions of musicals so I can't really agree or disagree with that the next unpopular opinion is Harry people are hotter if that's what you think that shirt I don't know depends on what you mean the last unpopular opinion is black

helping me reach this and just super thank whole and yeah I'll see you guys in the next video [Music]", "AEcUBF7vwGU": "hey there youtubers what's happening well I figured everyone's been asking so I'm gonna start making a video where I'm taking apart one of these pens so I've never taken apart this kind before well I got is two pliers here I'm just gonna grip one here grab it by the tip I'm gonna have to use the other ones for it this is kind of what I did last time and I did just kind of might be crushing this one though nope there she goes let's see if I can get the other end off I don't even know I think I did this last time I don't think I need to get this end off let's get it off anyway if it comes off I think this would be the end with all the electronics yo luck I came right out so I had another one before but I could not get the damn thing out and I remember I was struggling hard this one came apart pretty easy okay so now I'm gonna take some outs here to poke it out hopefully there you go this one came out easy nice perfect so there you go and now this has probably made the exact same way yeah this is a little different wouldn't be sure it looks like this cap can come off over here so you can't just no no these one's a little different like this one's even different from the last video there I'm gonna worry about this that's just the battery rip that off I bet I can get that off look I'm close you'll usually see like ridges yeah I don't know if this is gonna focus properly yeah there's like a little Ridge on the top usually look for that kind of thing that was like the ridge on the end of here when you're taking that off same kind of thing it's gonna take a look at your unit and see where you need to grab onto like I gotta keep grabbing onto the tips here so it's really good to have a good pair of linesman pliers there you go there's the wek and everything she's toast and I'm sure I can just dig that out if I were to get something I could probably just dig that little guy oh but actually you know what doing this backwards because I think this here on this end oh yeah okay there you go that's there you go that little rubber nipple in there and that'll that'll be where my uh now this stuff I'm not gonna smoke this stuff cuz I jumped in a river with this one this is river water basically yeah Rasen there anyway there you go so I bet it would be a little harder to get that out if it wasn't so liquidy I'm sure you can figure out a way like stick a pin in there dip it in there I don't know you'll you'll figure out a way and if you have to I bet like this plastics kind of flimsy enough I bet you can find a way to kind of find an exacto blade and if you were careful enough you know not to cut yourself you could probably put it down and cut through it or even figure out a way to get in there and eventually you can get your oil this one's plastic I'm not sure how other ones are but there you go thanks for watching",

community cannabis review so originally my strategy with videos was to basically make one video per brand essentially didn't even really get into multiple videos per strains um mostly just to show you that so you got a brand you searched it up on youtube or you saw it at the dyspo before you bought it search it up on youtube and just verify that they don't make some crap or they're not basically gonna scam you for some booty that you don't want um but i've been having a lot a lot of people say that they want more videos more often and i kind of want to make some more honestly more frequently than i do so i'm going to start making a video basically every time i get a cart or a concentrate if i can or as frequently as i can to that anyways so um i'm not doing the editing on this one i'm gonna re-download my editing software and stuff but for this one i don't feel like it needs it too much because there's not very much packaging to even go over let's start with the hush brand cartridge because i was really surprised with the last one that i got so i picked up another one so um i got this one at beaver bulls where are we at let's see if i can get it to focus there we go phone's actually focusing uh purple cali cush cannabis extract cartridge try that again um this is one gram container uh contains rather 77 points 77 percent thc there we go 77 point actually the 770 milligrams dhc excuse me i can't talk today um then the cbd is 22 milligrams total i believe that puts it at 0.22 percent i don't remember how to work that i'm not thinking clearly um you got all your production info on there and then compliance labels and stuff but other than that it doesn't come with much it's very bare bones for a cart um you got the price there before tax which this dyspo does a lot do before attacks some do after etc anyways and here's the cartridge itself you can see that's some really nice looking distillate which this looks hard to screw up but at the lower um lower price points you will find just like i assume it's made from trim that's even worse off so it just requires more starting material allowing more contaminants in total like chlorophyll and just well everything that's not desirable and you know with distillation i don't know that it matters maybe it's just they got better with their process don't know what the situation is all i know is in my opinion they got better here's the you got um got two silicone caps and then you got the compliance label which i always tear off or peel off whatever and this little weed sticker got these like everywhere all right let's see if i can get some better pictures of this i got a sun lamp right now which is doing nothing but making my eyes look gorgeous nothing for the weed though um let's do some different colors put it in front of super clean um super clear what got me into this was i actually got a cart a couple days ago and it was even better than this one i don't remember the strain i think it was like um maui papaya or something like that um all right well i'm throwing everything i can't speak or grab anything right now apparently um that's the one that i was talking about same same deal basically but yeah i tried them out and they were readily better than i remember them so i wanted to make a video plus i just want to get into making some anyways so let's see if i can't taste some terpenes on this the other one was very interesting terpene wise that's also something i was grateful for they normally have some basic ass servings but this last one they had um i definitely tasted some one of the more exotic terpenes i'll say i don't remember what it was though the consistency is really nice on this dude's gotten a little better i'm using a mirror behind my phone so that i can point it straight at me so bear with me as i look that way and i hit super nice these are up there now with like what i call gold standard distillate cards because like i said distill it's hard to [ __ ] up so once you get to a certain point it doesn't really get any better it's just like as good as it gets and that's really not hard to achieve either but somehow people occasionally mess it up but you got like buddies and select those cards are just distill it how it's supposed to be done hush is getting up there they're pretty dang close now other than the fact that buddies and select have better hardware i want to say it's very close for this one sadly the terpenes i'm only really getting some pretty heavy mirror scene it tastes like a lot of purple strains for sure which that might be something different yeah these cards are solid um i just wanted to get another video out because i want to start putting out more so i hope you enjoyed this like and subscribe and stay tuned and i'll put out more and ideally better ones soon thanks for watching", "2P5IH4kDFMU": "I got I got some more from sources Garcia from Cape Town how you doing it is weekend the teacher has got time to do a few videos alright listen also in the comment section just let me know whether you like this new intro itself just made we actually prefer the previous intro so right while back I bought this guy now this is the reload 1.5 audio a 24 millimeter fantastic this is probably one of my best audios I have tasted up in this point dual coil audio is this guy it is absolutely amazing I have found my pleasure zone regarding my 22 millimeter single coil audios and that has to be the Headlee absolutely the Headlee and then this guy this is the Sentinel I think if they're absolutely fantastic audio is beastly beastly so next tip is to find the 24 millimeter audio s or the best 24 millimeter audio which which provides me the best of everything alright and that is tricky because I mean I love the gun I will never sell my original goons I love them I love the cosmonauts the apocalypse I've got a soft spot and more even the mad dog etc but I mean this guy and the tokugawa Nadia those guys I've really made me smile okay they're absolutely amazing the only thing I wished that this guy had was a bottom-feeding pin okay some guys had a problem calling this guy and then dropping from the top but because you've got these chimney posts running up from the bottom and I had leaking through that because those posts run to these here or slits because this guy has got bottom a flame I didn't have that problem I just both to three millimeter diameter coils covering those chimneys or the pub those posts and wickedness and part and I never had a problem I didn't have juice leaking out of this but I still thought that it would be amazing if this car would come out and it has a bottom feeder and it did vipir us I decided to bring out this guy with a bottom-feeding version now unfortunately you can't just go and buy a bottom-feeding pan detector original regular dripper and convert it all right it is so hard I think the the posts inside he has press fitted I just can't be done apparently it can't be done but doesn't matter that I enjoyed this audio so much either solid aren ma I don't mind spending money on a second one so yeah this is what I've got just look at that guy oh my word ain't that beautiful so yeah here we have got the bottom feeding reload 1.5 24 millimeter audio so I hope this guy is going to be everything off I think it is going to be but the packaging is more or less the same if you take out the Hollier and you remove the sponge you get a little baggie inside the baggie you're gonna get quite a few rings er basically an extra ring for each earring which is currently on the ante and these three earrings on this okay so you get an extra one for each one of those three earrings cool beans extra sate put it that way you also get four post screws very nice Phillips deep Phillips both screws and then you get an allen key inside you're also gonna have a a pen a regular 510 pen but this regular 510 Turpin was installed inside this audience so I just removed the bottom-feeding pants that excluded in there and I put that bottom-feeding pen inside mine already so yeah that's what inside this little baggie very nice so without further ado let's make some things with this little guy if you compare it with the original same with same height same exterior look they have changed the coating they have changed because this guy started losing its paint and doesn't matter that as I said I'm a flavor taste hey hey I enjoy a flavor a lot so the paint coming off yeah it makes it look ugly but at a later stage I'm gonna remove all the paint there there it's gone totally already and then I'm gonna have this nice guy in stainless okay but yeah they didn't like that nor did a lot of customers like that and then they decided to bring out various versions now obviously the stainless steel will not have a problem but you do get this in a variety of colors and what they did were those except for this guy is got a stainless steel top cap the other guys have got a aluminium top cap and that aluminum top cap they have anodized all right so exteriorly that is one difference which you already have but regarding the air holes the arils have got exactly the same dimension they psyche Cyclops style you have got those that pay on either sides if you actually want to use dual airflow both on those sides and then you get one at the back as well so if you decide to run this guy in single coil you have got that option but the air holes are exactly the same on the original 1.5 as well as the sky and that is 10 millimeter in width and 3 millimeter in height so that's exactly the same as well the knurling at the top same runs in the same direction as well it's a no problem over there and then you've got this huge wide ball 18 dowel ring I'll probably swap this at a later stage I did order myself a special little one here you go which I will put on this nice a frosted 18 which I would want to use on this which I would think is going to look fairly nifty okay fail it nifty say yeah the locust also the same as the original nothing ever they but I do not blame them at all because the original was was fantastic so I mean why can change something which he has got a really got a winning recipe so the exterior problems which they were they did break to find that was the coating on the colored caps the previous one had a gold-plated dick whereas the new bottom feeling and you'll see this low B if alpha bf on that side version 1.5 with a serial number at the bottom every day and then real ed at the top it's just one little blemish which I had on mine and as you will see the other day I'm not sure what that is it is not a little sticker and I can't scratch it off I mean I I can scratch it but it doesn't worsen or anything so I'm not exactly sure what that is so yeah if you take a closer look I've got no idea what that the law area at the top of it is but just look at this machining area very nice threading very good you can see that this guy has been heat treated because the stainless has discolored over on that side okay then obviously you have got your gold-plated copper five tin comes up very easily the drip tip not too bad but yeah look at this very nice machining but it is a finger magnets so just bear that in mind I'll put mine on the G box over there and just check the tolerances it actually sits very nicely so if you lubricate this obviously it's going to come off much quicker all right that's it way easier okay so you can see we got four Phillips screws because this is a four post each post will house a leg which I like I enjoying it I don't like to post sharing business I dig it so you can see it's very nice and deep externa go alright so if you look over here you'll see the new reload the bottom-feeding addition actually has got beefier stronger Phillips screws then what the older version is so that's that's another difference okay so if you look at the two dicks on the inside however these posts okay see if you look at the two decks on the inside you will see the pattern of your peek insulation dividing your puzzle from your negative side has got exactly the same pattern has this guy but as I said that portion over there has been pressed fitted so it's very hard to get out that section on that side and that's why I think they brought out a bottom-feeding addition all right you can even see some coloration on that side to show you that this guy actually has been heat treated now the caps when they're aluminum if you don't have the stainless steel version the caps are anodized you have got the stainless steel deck at the bottom of here but it has been sarah coated now in case you're wondering what the hell is set I've coated me but this guy is only been gold-plated now Sarah coated is when you take a lot of heat and actually apply a very thin film of ceramic now when I say a thin film we are talking about sub micron thin what it does it prevents this whole deck from rusting her wherever it has been coated from rusting yeah it is basically scratch proof it is very strong grates and very strong surface area and then it is also solvent resistant so I mean your liquids do not draw into this coating as well I measured the depth of the juice walls both juice wells around four comma seven millimeters deep except if you take it inside that indentation as well then it's going to go to more than six decided to treat this beautiful Ettie with some mask Clapton's which i have just made any of these the height of the cause which I have you can see it's just above those chimneys I think that looks good nice and shiny let's quickly give it a squonk e-everything you see the squonk oil at the bottom of there oh and there you can see all the juice coming through freshly whipped juiced okay let's go for the deal airflo easy to buy okay let's just quickly wipe it with a standard whiteboard el realtor and see how it actually goes wide open it flows nice let's go for the frosted captain say that goes sucks back well let's reduce the air flow bit and that's the way I like it that's the way I like it we have got a very nice 24 millimeter bottom feeling or a gas I think it was a very bright move from them to actually bring out this bottom-feeding version it's just a pity you had to spend a lot more just to get this a T so that is going to be a con from Assad the fact that I had to buy another one but the luck thing is I wanted a stainless steel in any cases I didn't mind getting this one just look how funky it looks on top of this G box I think it looks I think it looks puffy the flavor is very very good but it's not deadly the flavor just but this well built small juice chamber or a chamber 22 millimeter single coil area is just it just Rises about the wrist when it comes to flavor I mean the flavors the flavors not far of mic no mistake but I mean I have been wiping my lime shake almost every video and I know I know exactly how it must taste or how I like to get it to taste and the Headlee takes me there all right the Headley and the Sentinel takes meeting I will play around with a Haku again this guy because I know there's a lot of people that drive about this but I tried a second bolt on this and it's still not way there's other - oh no it's definitely not but this guy is got a very very good flavor so if you guys are into your your dual coil bolts and you enjoy a 20 for your large the top of audio's which produces a lot more a flaw than these guys are because these cars all are most respected for sure winner winner chicken dinner for you to get it what do i why is sitting watching come by the thing okay it is really really very nice and it's gonna give you everything which you want in a 24 millimeter audio guys is this relayed all right let's quickly see our farmers actually swung to get it to leak at the hills they go now you saw how much and how hard I had to press that for it to physically start leaking out of those arrows so no one is gonna fight that way no one you gotta be you gotta be mental to put so much strain on your squonk bottle in any case so this guy takes a lot of squeezing before it actually is going to leak before those because those posts rise up for comma seven millimeter okay rise up to the top and that's quite a lot so yeah and you've got your cotton at the bottom there which is also going to soak up your juices woo more juice flavors actually better very good guys very good so yeah I'll give my okay for this atomizer most differently I will vapor a bit more restricted than that okay you saw easily it also turns there's no problem over there just want to get all these juice which I have just put in there there you go if you enjoy the flavor you enjoy the clouds this thing looks very good seem looks awesome it looks very nice go for it tomorrow I will do a review on this guy which are also receiving the 2 1 3 C 2 1 3 4 shy for shy single battery spanker this is Kaiser enjoy a weekend up until Sunday evening over now Jezza you", "Jjsx6pVrWPs": "[Music]", "3r5PRXx4SjU": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] when we designed the

being here and for joining me on my journey of becoming joe march through creating her wardrobe or rather creating a wardrobe that she may have worn in the 1860s so i thought i would begin by showing you how she would have gotten dressed remember this dress would have been when she was 15 years old so she is not fully a woman yet however girls did wear clothing that mimicked their mothers and undergarments that mimic women's and so from a very young age they would wear corded petticoats small crinolines corded stays or corded corsets different things like that so even though joe is not fully a woman yet her undergarments would have mimicked the woman's in many ways so of course you have these blood drawers underneath and then you have the chemise and then on top of that i have a corset whether joe was fully wearing a corset at 15 or not of course we don't know for sure but i am a woman so i need a corset um the next thing that i'm going to put on is actually a corded petticoat um girls in that time frame who didn't always wear a kernel line sometimes they would just wear multiple layers of petticoats including a corded petticoat and so i am going to take a little artistic license here and make an assumption that because joe was a tomboy by her own admission and her sister's admission she probably actually did not really want to wear a crindle line and a hoop skirt and all of that jazz she probably tried to get away with wearing the least possible when it came to those sinks so my guess is is if she was allowed to she would have worn a corded petticoat and layers of petticoats instead of wearing a cage cuddling so you have the corded petticoat um you can access the video on my channel to learn how to make one of these i actually show you how to make two different styles and you can actually also access a upcoming video to learn how to make this corset and how to make the chamise and drawers so all of those are coming soon so she has her quarter petticoat and then i'm going to put one petticoat on top of that um she may have had more um they would wear as many pencils as possible to make the dresses um the fullness that they wanted but i'm going to go with one petticoat for now and so i'm gonna put that on next and then i'm going to put on the dress so this dress is actually two pieces um but what i did they would make their dresses in two pieces sometimes because then they could wear them for more things right so you could use the skirt for both a day dress and an evening dress and just change the bodice um and so i did that to mimic that i also i'm going to use this skirt again for one of her future outfits as you will see as we continue through this series and so that was the other reason now i just safety pinned them together they would have used hooks and eyes um at the waist to hold them together but because of one of the upcoming outfits i do not want hooks and eyes on the outside of my skirt waistband i'm giving away some details there but because of that i am just going to safe depending them on the outside for today's outfit and then when we get to the other outfit i will be able to unsafe depending so i have safety pin the two together so you have the bodice and you have a skirt um remember the skirt they are two inches off above her ankle or above my ankle um so joe's skirts as a girl would not have been all the way to her ankle until she was 18 and so she would have still had them up above her ankle but that's very easy to change because you would just put girl tucks in and then as she got older each year if the skirt was still wearable um then she would her mother or she would have just let out the growth all right it took me just a minute to get myself all buttoned up into this dress it's uh good that joe had sisters to help her get buttoned up um because this one as you can see closes at the back and so i had to do all those buttons on my own and of course it's in joe's two colors that i feel like would have been some of the colors she would have preferred the red and the blue i used the coat sleeve um pattern for the era there was two major sleeves that were used during the 1860s there was the full gathered sleeve and then there was the coat sleeve pattern and i used the coat sleeve because i felt like that was something joe would have preferred it's less feminine than the full gathered sleeve and it would have been less likely to get in her way during her adventures um i have the red piping it has the full pleats across the front and across the back i'm assuming that is to give room for the girls developing body as she grows because it's all about having growth tucks and making clothes last as long as possible contrary to how we tend to view our clothes today it closes with hooks and eyes at the wrist the entire bodice is fully lined um interlined with a cotton poplin which is a very common type of fabric they would have used in glazed cotton actually was is what's most often found um but it's very hard to find today cotton poplin is a similar substitute so the entire bodice is fully lined with that um and then the skirt is closely pleated like many of their skirts were because they would fully pleat them as full as possible um so their skirts were extremely full to fit over their cage kind of lines and their petticoats to give that illusion of a small waist because their skirts were very wide their shoulders were very wide visually and so that gives the illusion of a small waist let me know in the comments below what you think do you think this is a dress that joe might have worn in the opening of the book little women and without further ado we will go on to our next set of chapters and discuss the next outfit i will be creating for joe i for almost forgot to show you guys the collar um obviously during that time frame they didn't actually wash their dresses a lot they washed the undergarments and one of the ways that they would keep the neck of their undergarment clean was by wearing collars they were separate and they were starched and they were usually white so that they could bleach them and so this is the color i created for joe i went with more of a stand up collar that more imitated the men's styles of the day which is a nod to the reference in the beginning of the book when her and meg are going to the party and it mentions joe's stiff a gentlemanly color and so i use that as an inspiration creating the color for this dress to protect the neckline of the dress so we read chapters 8 through 14 this time and throughout these chapters we see joe wanting to become something and we learn more about her ambitions in chapter 13 when they're imagining the next 10 years of their lives the girls and lori joe says i want to do something splendid something heroic or wonderful that won't be forgotten after i'm dead i don't know what but i'm on the watch for it and meaning to astonish you all someday i think i shall write books and get rich and famous that would suit me so that is my favorite dream so in addition to joe's character traits that we talked about last time of adventurous and active empathetic and passionate and imaginative and literary we began to see throughout this set of chapters that joe is also extremely ambitious especially for a girl of her time when more traditional roles were in place for men and women and we see meg wanting to get married to a rich man and have children and in sharp contrast to that as almost as a character foil we see joe wanting to do something with her life in an independent fashion and she's not talking about getting married she's not talking about having kids she's talking about writing a book she's talking about doing something heroic and those kind of things we also learn more about her passion um in this sentence we learn about her anger in chapter eight amy gets upset at joe because joe does not let her go to the theater with lori and meg and joe and so amy burns joe's book while joe is gone and it talks about how joe is very angry after that and how she does not accept amy's apology and not only that she ignores amy and it even mentions that everyone the girls and miss march had learned that it was not wise to try to confront joe about this or to try to change those mind instead they would just let joe's anger run its course until it passed and ultimately joe's anger passes when they go ice skating and amy follows along without joe and laurie's permission and fall to the ice and joe and lori have to rescue amy um and so we learn about how strong of feelings joe has even more in this set of chapters but we also repeatedly see joe's writing ambition obviously with amy burning her book we also see it in chapter 10 when it talks about the pc and the po and how joe is the writer and editor of the pickwick portfolio even though some of the other girls contribute joe is the mind behind that and then ultimately the set of chapters ends with chapter 14 where joe furtively goes off to try to get her first story published um so we learn a lot about joe's ambitions in this set of chapters and very specifically what those ambitions are right so i am not going to be creating an entirely new dress for this set of chapters instead because joe is still 15 at this time frame throughout this entire set of chapters joe is still 15 years old so the fashion and the dresses she would have worn would not have changed that much during that time frame um also in sharp contrast to how we deal with our clothes today they would have made their dresses last as long as possible and they would have had a set of dresses that they would have repeatedly worn rather than having a lot of different dresses that they only wore a few times so i think it's perfectly possible to continue with the same dress for joe but i am going to create some new outfits with it for several of the events in this set of chapters so the first one is that i am going to be creating a quilted petticoat um i thought about creating an entire skating suit for when joe goes skating with lori um but i did some research and prior attire actually already has created one so if you are interested in seeing what an 1860 skating suit for women would have looked like go check out prior attire's channel and hers um i also had a hard time nailing down what teen girls would have worn for their skating ensemble during this time period um i could have just copied the women's one but since prior attire had already created and because i live in texas and would never get to wear it i decided to forego the skating suit idea but i am going to create the quilted petticoat and then the other thing i'm going to create is i'm going to create joe's scribbling suit now her scribbling suit is not called that until later on in the book however throughout these chapters she is very actively writing and so i think it's appropriate at this point to go ahead and create her scribbling suit because she probably was already wearing it or something similar to it during this set of chapters during this time frame but it just hasn't formally been mentioned in the book so here are the items that i'm going to use to create them this is a cotton flannel with quilt batting in the middle and flannel on either side um i know the print is probably not the most accurate for the 1860s uh however i do love a good deal and this was on a good deal at farmhouse fabrics one of my favorite fabric stores and so i went ahead and bought it and so i will be creating her quilted petticoat out of this it'll be nice and warm um i'm hoping once the pandemic is over to be able to do some outdoor events where i sell some of the products that i make and so this will be perfect when i'm doing outdoor winter events i can add this on under whatever i'm wearing to help keep me warm so it will be very useful not just part of joe's wardrobe but that is what i'm going to make it is in blue which is one of the colors i decided was probably predominant in joe's wardrobe even if the print might not have been her favorite you also have to keep in mind they would have used whatever they had um it could have been a hand-me-down for meg it could have been amy's it could have been mommy's it could have been you know someone else's too so it might not have been made just specifically for jo but she would have worn something like that underneath her skirt when she went ice skating the scribbling suit is actually described really well in the book it's actually described as a black wool pineapple with a black cap and a red bow and so i have black wool this is a worsted wool and so i am going to create a pen for i have pulled a few pictures so far most of what i'm finding when i'm researching for pentaphores is actually for girls so i'm going to assume because joe is only 15 at this point that her pinafore would have been more of a girl's pinafore than a woman's apron and so i'm going to pattern it after that and then i will make the cap and do the red bow so here are some of the pen four ideas that i found of course i will be doing another video once i complete these two items her scribbling suit and her quilted petticoat and i will do a similar video to what i did at the beginning of this one to show you guys how to get dressed and how the quilted pineapple would have been worn and all those different things and then our next chapter after this set is just chapter 15. so there's not a lot of reading before the next outfit will be revealed if you do not remember what the reading schedule is here it is again so we've already done chapters one through seven that was this outfit that i'm wearing right now chapters eight through fourteen is what i just explained and we i will be doing the scribbling suit and the quilted petticoat for the ice skating and joe's writing chapter 15 will be for outfit three and then chapter 16 through 29 will be outfit four chapters 30 to 36 will be outfit 5 37 through 40 will be outfit 6 and 41 through 46 will be the final outfit i'm so glad that you've joined me hopefully you are reading along in the book let me know if you agreed or disagree with how i've characterized joe and how i am creating her wardrobe i would love to hear your thoughts below remember that i'm doing this not only from a historical standpoint but also from a creative standpoint as far as analyzing literature so i'm trying to incorporate both things together to create joe's wardrobe if you would like more frequent updates than my videos here on youtube please follow the hashtag becomingjoemarch on instagram because i post things with that hashtag frequently and in my stories

happening YouTube it's chaley coming at you again on another alacrity you this is the third and final eliquid review of the cloud headline that I'm bringing you today guys this is on the pineapple flavor so we tuned into the blue razz and the and the pink lemonade flavor I really thought they were both good in their own way there were really good flavors excellently liquid really enjoy both of them like photo blue raspberry it was a little bit better than the pink lemonade got a lot of that blue raspberry taffy flavor out of it the pink lemonade was supposed to be a pink lemonade beverage but I got more of a taffy flavor from that too so here we are the pineapple flavor now you're getting my first impressions right here on camera I have not baked on this yet up and flown down so I'm giving you my honest thoughts right here doing a review so big thank you to Andy over to Aspen Valley thanks for sending this over my way purpose a review that will not change my thoughts or opinions on this e-liquid so thank you and eing the rest of the Aspen Valley crew over there so guys what we're going to do I'm going to go ahead and show you to bottle up close so we're going to open it we're going to smell it talk about the smell and will they want it let you know what I'm getting from the flavor now we're going to grade each category a being the best at being the worst so here's the bottle up front kind of looks like the other bottles guys they're all made with that TSN nicotine derivative that's a tobacco free nicotine comes in a zero three six milligram nicotine content so it's got the little guy but the heads in the clouds there pineapples on there gives you all the warnings on the back and it's 100 mil bottle $29.99 so I think that's a fantastic price for some premium e-liquid so let's go ahead guys let's open it up let's see we get from that smell really good pineapple smell it almost smells kind of like a pineapple juice and to be honest we like a pineapple uh yelling pineapple juice that's what I get from it excellent excellent smell that pineapple smells really nice and sweet just a nice pineapple juice smell again from it so button vape on and see if we pick up on that taffy but even if I even if it takes to me like pineapple juice I'll be fine with that this smells really good alright so I got it on the sub-zero legendary mechanical mods prime my favor mod that I that I own with the matching 24 millimeter sub-zero RDA again please don't pick up the mechanical mod unless you know Ohm's law and battery safety so uh let's go ahead and guys get a pair of fuse Clapton's in here I already got it waked up ready to go let's go ahead there we are so for a 70/30 blend I mean this juice just Chuck's the vapor I don't know the the blue razz and the and the pink lemonade didn't seem to put out as much vapor as this pineapple ones putting out for some reason that maybe to set up that I'm using right here of course but for 70/30 blend it's really putting out the vapor nice dense milky clouds lingering around for a little bit I'm going to give the vapor production on this one Abbey and again that could be because of the setup that I'm using but really nice a really nice vapor production nice milky cloud so if you're looking for that you're definitely get that with this so let's go ahead and vape on a little bit more and it will talk about the flavor man I mean that that's its Chuck in the vapor guys so flavor on the inhale I'm absolutely picking up on that pineapple absolutely very prominent you drip a little bit more on here while we're talking about it so I honestly I get almost like a like a pineapple juice flavor to be honest with you I guess you can say like a pineapple taffy I never really had pineapple taffy so it's hard for me to compare that but I get like a pineapple juice flavor from it like a nice sweet pineapple juice it tastes fantastic I'm going to just say right now just from trying this on my first impressions I like this one over the blue and over the pink lemonade which is surprising because I love blue raspberry flavors but this pineapple right here is phenomenal I'm not coming out picking up on the inter taste that I picked up from the blue razz in the pineapple this were from the blue razz and he pink lemonade this one just has straight pineapple flavor from the inhale to the XL it's nice and sweet but not too sweet so it's not too sweet to the point where it's almost like that syrupy pineapple taste it's just really really good guys it's very good really tasty like over here let me go into a couple more damn that is phenomenal now I haven't tried this in a tank yet so I can't give you my my thoughts from a tank I don't have any any on deck right now I should have went and did it out of the tank too for all you tank lovers just to show you but I don't have any tanks whipped up so we're just gonna stick with the RDA today but I can tell you right now if I'm getting this kind of good flavor out of the RDA I'm sure that tank is going to produce really good flavor as well this is phenomenal I think Amy told me this is his uh this is his favorite out of all three now Amy vape some exclusively from tanks from from what I know anyway so he's making out of a tank so for all you tank lovers that answers it right there it's going to be really good out of a tank as well but guys this flavor is spot-on it's phenomenal I get definitely that pineapple on the inhale on the exhale I pick up on that just like sweet pineapple notes I'm not getting any cream nothing in between I'm not really tasting taffy either I just taste more of like a nice subtle sweet pineapple juice flavor that's pretty much all there is to it with this one guys this one's really really good I can't say that enough I mean it's really good I can absolutely vape this all day do I recommend it to you 100% if you're in the pineapple flavors I can't see you not liking this one you're gonna like it trust me you're gonna like it god that's tasty man I was not expecting this one to be that good to be honest with you I thought that the pineapple is probably going to be my least favorite out of the three and then it'll be my my top and ended up being my most favorite I mean if that's even most-favored than a word oh well it's a word today but yeah it's it's excellent guys I mean it just tastes like straight pineapple juice from the inhale pineapple juice from the exhale pineapple juice it leaves a nice lingering aftertaste and a bad to your throat just a nice sweet pineapple aftertaste that's pretty much it I mean it sucks the vapor so if you're looking for something that's really going to put out clouds guys nice dense milky clouds also going to put out a nice pineapple flavor on the inhale and exhale absolutely and recommended in the cloud heads right here this is definitely my favorite out of the three no doubt about it I'm really surprised I'm actually in shock that this was that good I thought this one was going to put it be my least favorite and sure enough ended up being the best one at all three of my thing and let me know down below guys comment down below if you had this flavor if you had the other two what your thoughts are I know they just came out with this so a lot of people haven't really had a chance to try it yet but I'm telling you you can't go wrong with

uh we got the super good charts on now because we're really charted out here it's been at five and a half cents uh kind of forever and it kind of went up to five and a half high cents so that's super exciting so what we did is is that's why we have shane on tvf tvf tvf okay and uh we're gonna add some stuff to this and talk about dogecoin and stuff he doesn't own any cryptocurrency i might by the end of the podcast he might he might he might buy some before the end of the podcast um but he deals in uh cash businesses so he's a businessman and uh he's also a very close friend of mine yep even uh notwithstanding his poor advice uh just 10 minutes ago dave was pissed i was angry i was running very very very angry and uh and uh he also lives across the street so uh and so that's how we know each other so 14 minutes i'll give my elevator speech yeah so all right so how's everybody doing there today sorry i didn't look at the chats yet oh this sounds good all right yep sounds good we got that all taken care of uh you got to know all these people do i know them personally no they don't every day no like i don't know logan whaley who just said lame so i don't know that's gonna go uh is that for the is that for the stream logan or is that just for something else the tbf because it's for the stream then it's going to go in the next advertisement i have uh because i put that in there it'll say lame it'll like they'll be like this is the best stream live stream on the internet and then somebody else says you suck so i like to put those together that happened to me once that happens all the time yeah yeah i know gabe i know duncan almost everybody else in here is in here on a regular basis what's up thomas broker and see with the blue and stuff that means that they're a mod and they uh uh what's a mod uh uh a moderator so when somebody gets out of control uh and the system kind of takes care of it that somebody has to do something so if somebody types in like then it stops it from being on the stream automatically you have to quit looking at me you're doing what i was every time you look at me your sound goes down oh sorry i know i'm handsome okay i used to be a porn star yes he used to be he was before the accident yeah and then it's hard to if you can't get an erection it's hard to be a porn star so it was just one time one time you had to stop uh can you turn the volume down and then back up of what which one boom which volume the sound the music i don't have a main mixer on this thing so what's up romania romanian sleepy random has won three of the contests we've had for cash wow um party plugin what's up party plugin i've never been to romania duncan duncanator logan uh so yeah so rage view studios and broker they are they're uh mods administrators so they they have they have uh they can control the chat and stuff wow so much power yes they do have a lot of power but do they do they have a tbf that's the question i don't know for those who just came on tbf is token black friend i'm mr blue hair dave's token black friend although he just got mad at me he's like and you mean to say he was angry before this it wasn't my fault yes i was angry very angry was it about doge were you angry about those oh well that's okay you can also say i suck too i i don't mind that at all so in a former life i have a thick skin uh for one just from my dating history two yeah um because i i used to play music and so you're kind of exposed and when you do that people people aren't shy about their opinions so and you can tell when they hate you too so do they there you go he's got a buddy black josh josh tbf you know you actually can get into more clubs with a black friend sometimes what more clubs with a black friend into more clubs yeah i don't think so what if it's lebron james you can get any club well that's different he's a celebrity he's still a token black friend it's not because he's black you get in the club it's because he's a professional basketball player okay i have to work on this then yeah i think yeah sorry in fact you're like if he wasn't famous you would not get in the club because a lot of clubs have the saggy pant hat rule uh but sleepy random you identify as a tbf welcome to the club there there you go yeah all right see nice there you go so doge how'd it do so doge hasn't done much of anything uh and so that's why i didn't really talk about it uh all that much today because uh the price fluctuations were all still within uh a half of uh a half of a half cent so you wanted me to remind you elon musk 26 billion in one day oh that's why i put it in the title yeah so kind of a recap since it's friday uh and elon musk had made an extra 26 billion because of uh bitcoin and tesla so that's what that is oh logan's got covet i hope you feel better i had covered yeah blue hair dave and no hair that's right yeah he doesn't have any you should change the title the times i'm here i don't deserve that i gotta earn that right i can't give it first time i'm never coming back you're not gonna let me so doge is mooning i don't know yesterday we i found i found out you could draw on the chart were you watching at that point wait i can't my mom cheated on my dad with a black dude that's why i have such a dope ash bro that's nice oh all right everything's a true story it sounds true why would he lie [Laughter] by the way for those of you who haven't had covid when you get it they see have 90 days of immunity so i went to vegas baby yeah he got he got kovid and now he's been vaccinated yeah so yeah so we're safe in here yeah i've also had this shot basically no condoms in a whorehouse i've had the shot you know and the tail that i grew is only like like like like eight nine inches long so far so how much does elon have in doge does anybody know um yeah his wallet was like number 11. i don't have the thing to pull up right now but he had like the 11th largest wallet and i think it was like 10 million bucks or something did you hear since it's recap did you also hear about dallas mavericks uh cuban said they're the largest uh doge merchant in the world now that was after they made the announcement yeah so that uh the dallas mavericks i think it was only like a thousand dollars worth but that's a lot of dose coins so if you do a thousand times point zero five uh no wait i can't do the math on that uh uh calculated challenge i don't oh wait a thousand divided by right can you do that with siri seriously it's a thousand divided by five cents i guess it was more than that that's twenty thousand dose coins but and then twenty eight percent of all doge is robin hood you know what robin hood app is is where people trade through it yeah so so twenty thousand dogs look at duncan haters on it so i might not see is uh so if i get coveted i have 30-day immunity does that mean i can go in raw that's what i just said if you could do that and get vaccinated you can go to a whorehouse without a condom i guess so uh this is not financial advice uh but not health advice yeah i wouldn't yeah i was joking you still want to wear a condom son wrap that rascal here we go dimitri norman uh yo bhd if someone is visiting san diego what would you suggest staying to be close to the fun stuff and dispensaries the dispensaries are kinda is there any mpv uh they're all over san diego yeah you can get it delivered um they do deliver yeah you everybody delivers so you don't have to be near a dispensary you can just uh it's like weed maps or whatever and they'll deliver mankind delivers everywhere i'd stay in pacific beach yeah didn't you live in pacific i did for two decades two decades two decades yeah is that 20 years that is 20 years you bought more today i bought more yesterday because i got sick of waiting what's up lex so 190 000 black x did a bunch of the uh graphics and he uh created the video that we showed on the intro yes uh i guess uh robinhood is working on their own crypto wallets oh ben jay see ben jay is from pennsylvania he likes walking he's not a football fan and he thinks people that buy houses and live in them with their single family residences are idiots i've seen texas he's very uh he's very spicy he's muy picante but does he have a tbf muy bicante but texas nurse patient is back we saw her the other day hello texas nurse uh patriot what's up okay that's right she her picture's a woman now so because she's definitely a woman i made the mistake twice with two different people of assuming that they were men just because they were in this room but i'm glad to have by the way our female viewership has ticked up over 10 percent wow how many people are watching right now we have 26 concurrent and there's been 105 in the room uh how do we keep them in the room uh we have to be more entertaining so can i tell my elevator speech we'll ask the people if they want to hear it do you want to hear my elevator speech well i think they need to know more about you before you start telling them elevator that is my elevator speech me in 30 seconds why you should like me okay we're gonna turn the music down a little and we're to let uh tb how do you want to be referred to tbf is going to uh discuss his elevator pitch of who he is and why you want to hear from oh am i talking now yeah you can talk into the microphone so for those of you that know me my name is mr wonderful but i also go by uh tvf i am dave's uh close token black friend who lives across the street so he can take me you really got to get up in there so we can go into bars together and all that people like them so i'm here today to just hang out with them and drink beer that's the main thing plus i don't own any doge so he invited me on here to think about buying doge today and talk to you guys and see where should i get doge at like if you're buying those today where did you register all that so we're going to talk about that today right dave sure we'll talk about whatever whatever we want to talk about today you know why it's friday no because i i just started the stream so uh so i'll tell you guys one thing i'll give you i won't do the elevator speech now i'll give you one clue though the other day i called the bank because i want to buy something i own a lot of stuff and i said i need six million dollars six million dollars i didn't say billion i'm not elon but i said six million dollars and you know what my banker said uh you know i i need to see the numbers because i can probably do it at three percent variable but if they're good numbers i can do it at 275. and i immediately came to dave and said some dudes willing to give me six million for three percent how did we get here back to you dave is that your elevator speech no it's a tease to all of you because obviously somebody in a six million is sort of cool how much does just six million dollars he's a businessman uh here's the difference okay we live near each other uh we have similar lifestyles except for our work lifestyle yeah i work 70 hours a week yeah well i work a lot too i don't know that that's weird you've seen every single like uh show out there every single movie okay so i watched a lot of netflix but that doesn't make me a bad person um and so but we have different perspectives on business and money but some of them are similar we have similar attitudes i think about uh what it takes to get things accomplished right you'd say maybe yeah but we have different uh fields so he is a highly educated business person he knows all the stuff so he's got his master's in business and he's done everything can i tell some of the stuff about you sure now you give my my elevator speech thank you hi man okay so yeah so so shane we met what eight years ago eight years ago nine years ago something like that eight nine years ago uh because of the neighborhood and we moved in uh and uh he is a retired uh army major uh uh bronze cross or a recipient it's a bronze star bronze star that's yes sorry yeah so so me zero military background right so he's the exact he's a disciplined person who uh you're white i'm black yes and uh and so he's got like all the bona fide credentials of a business person he owns a lot of hell let him talk more about this but he owns actual cash businesses where all my stuff is internet in the virtual world so whether it's doing something like this or it's digital marketing which is my company mine's all virtual and his is actually brick and mortar so totally two different things right so there you go yeah thank you for uh it is it's i love being in the military i'm retired now but i get a pension in like eight years i'm very excited about the pension i'll use it to buy doge when do you get it eight years oh uh actually seven now like six and a half years i get a pension the bad news is you're getting older right i am getting older yeah and i was in the army thank you uh yeah so he's got a totally different uh outlook on things so like he does like a local shark tank thing and he's also on a couple boards so he's like a businessman with a suit and i'm not i'm like a lone wolf type business person like how to make money in side hustle and so it's interesting i thought we could use a different perspective on here and thank you for that 108 700 uh 6 million would be 108 million doge thank you for that uh duncan hater look at you that's twice you got the number yeah so what's your elevator speech uh so hi my name is shane i'm married i have four kids the number one thing important to me is my family i worked for corporations they don't care about you you're only a number so the number one thing i've learned to focus on is my family i'm proud to be in the military and serve and get a bronze star i have my master's degree and at the height of my career i ran a two billion dollar company and had over 7000 employees bam there you go yeah that two billion is pretty impressive so he was in control of two billion dollars worth of of business and my elevator speech is is i work him underwear hi and i've been fired like three or four times in my career have you yeah oh first one was like 17 i chose to go to kings island instead of showing up to work on time because she was hot it wasn't it probably was well that's worth it oh yeah yeah i got fired from ponderosa yeah if you're like 17 to 25 and there's a hot woman or whatever if you got a hot date you you quit that job so let's see who here who here has been fired if you've been fired just say i've been fired how do you make how do you what do you want him to say would they say i'm fired or what do you say me too or uh what's do this we have enough people in here we're gonna run a contest and give away 10

but there's a thing called covid that happened that's not a hoax or is it real it's real apparently and i can't i'm not and i cannot go to italy so wow look at all those fired but i did also didn't build the mud room thing so morgany i see that fire too i've been there with you baby although maybe not everybody got fired maybe let's use the word pirate are you guys all lying and you're just saying that to get the money no you told him to put in the word fired i know but i thought i'd do oh i didn't mention that did i so that's okay wow okay pandemic there you go probably have about one in three people in this room that don't think it's real but you know people are entitled to their opinion yes well whatever it is i i couldn't take my life to italy this year i tried to go this year last year then i tried to go this year and it turns out i still can't book the trip and go yeah well you know so if you guys go and try and book a trip say for january of 2022 they're already booking up because people assume it's safe so if you go to bahamas try to go hawaii things are booking up already it's crazy yeah i need to book it i want to book it now anyway just because it's cheaper right so so party plug-in man that ball guy is a nice guy thank you there you go party plug-in and carl norman fire did a covet those [ __ ] um am i allowed to curse oh my god you can uh but if we go ridiculous on it i think somehow the ads might get punished that's what broken forge is gonna but i don't think i don't think that i curse but i don't make a habit of it because i don't know if the advertising so if you stay on a couple minutes all 12 dollars they'll pay me for this i'll tell you how cursing made blue hair dave very angry today what cursing 29 i got five that's because it was

i probably made what 70 equity on this place oh yeah since we moved in you're probably worth a million just for the house i'm close to it i think and these houses when we're bottoming with like 860. now they're selling for 1.5 yeah 1.6 our neighbor listed like seven months ago yeah he's an ass yeah why am i cursing it's the beer so our neighbor listed for like one six we said you're never gonna get one six he got it in like a week we're like oh and then then he he bought a house we're not gonna say name he they know what they're doing right so they bought a house and then they sold it here and way more than we thought they were gonna sell it for and then they moved to another neighborhood realized they wanted to buy an even more expensive house yes they did and then they just sold that house for 2.4 six 2.4 million dollars 600 000 more than they bought it for a year ago but you know one thing's consistent dave neither the neighbor's there um i'll see my i'm getting the call she's

for like a warm up like she's crazy she's done 37 marathons yeah so she's also the coach she's a track coach yeah so the 26 billion dollars dave somebody wants to know what that means in your title in my title it was a recap of the week and elon musk made 26 billion dollars by tuesday of this week and one day in one day yeah it was on tuesday he made 26 billion he may have lost some of it today [Music] and thank you to duncan that is like 108 um oh that's 6 million forget my calculator doesn't go that far stop smoking first yeah smoking i'll get in the way of it yeah and i'm a walker because i weigh too much i work like 78 hours a week so i don't my health is horrible excuses so yes so if i were gonna buy dogecoin there you go if you guys could list i'm gonna have my pen and paper here actually for this if you guys could list where did you buy your dogecoin what platform did you go to to start buying doge can we throw those up talk it talk talk uh tbf into buying doge where should get it all those kinds of things in the chat please well i want money today i can afford to under three i ran a marathon and my time was five hours and like ten minutes no two hours and 52 is phenomenal mine was uh 4 34 and my wife and i had the worst argument of my marriage at mile 25 i told her i wanted a divorce because like she wasn't she said get up and run and i was like i'm going to die and i wanted a taxi cab are you starting a mile left uh 1.2 miles actually but yeah i was like i i'm not i got a yeah so where we got finance i feel like robin i feel like the last three of the marathon were much easier than like mile 19 20 21 22. well i just got back from afghanistan and i wore an army shirt like a t-shirt and it rubbed my knuckles raws like blood was oh yeah nipples bloody nipples horrible did you wear combat boots or no i'm not that hardcore no i did care i've seen people do that yeah i'm not good so robin hood uh oh thank you uh rage said if i send him some jesus my daughter's calling me again he's on the phone again very rude he's talking to his daughter though yes bloody nipples i think there's something about what's over seven miles you've got to be careful about the bloody nipples uh mine happened about mile 13 and uh they tried to put band-aids on and it came off because i was all sweaty so it was really yeah yeah i didn't get buddy nipples because i had to walk a lot of time so by dance and robin hood those are the only two what else am i seeing and thank you for if i then mow you the money you'll invest it that's very kind of yes dimitri i use binance finance u.s site but i also don't get crazy because for me it's simple i literally i buy and hold so okay so i'm gonna do binance what should my first doge purchase be should it be like a small like 510 to say i did it or should i go in like two or three hundred dollars you gotta go a couple hundred bucks a couple hundred yeah because think about it you could make up to 20 times your money so i make up two so when do i buy huh when do i buy right now it's fine because if you look just uh i mean not financial advice but if you look historically you're probably not going to get a chance to buy it under five cents for a while and if it did it's only gonna last like 10 minutes so when i set an alert 900 500 is that 500 doge or 500 and that's like um about a couple thousand doge five hundred dollars thank you fran lewis yeah five hundred dollars because if they're five and a half cents got it so but if it goes to a dollar that's like you know pretty much 20 times your money cause i always watch but i'm bad at math as the video i did yesterday shows i always watch this thing on here that shows the doge amount that you have up and it's like five five then five four nine i mean it always is like right within like point zero zero one of each other it wasn't always like that so these swings are between like four and a half cents and then eight cents and then recently it's stabilized which is good because people didn't even consider it like even an option before before elon musk yeah kind of yeah i mean so we shall say something like crazy i mean it's always been popular meme wise but not exactly as an investment tool people ignored it but but it actually actually has some benefits to it uh as opposed to other coins because it's not built on any kind of uh um process that it needs to carry out it it it's a fast way to transact money too so right so it works actually for buying things and both of us missed the bitcoin thing too yeah well i made some poor decisions in my life i hope my wife doesn't see this i actually was talking to a lawyer who i thought was sort of hitting on me and she told me i should invest in bitcoin like a year and a half ago uh and i didn't because i thought she was hitting on me yeah look at bitcoin here let's just look at the take a look at the last six months of bitcoin so if i would have bought it when she said yeah and legit like like wall street people that typically would would have [ __ ] on bitcoin four years ago predict that it's going to go to 100 000 by the end of this year and then up to 250 to maybe 500 000 over the next like five to ten years wow because it'll be like if it's seen the same as gold and that's i think a lot of people view it as like a substitute for gold substitute for gold okay but i'll start with doge because i don't have what is 56 000 what's this more fun you should go hang out in some uh in like a just bitcoin uh live stream okay i've seen the numbers out there i'm gonna do uh what's up chris 300 a doge today florida critic you might be right there's a lot of people with a lot of money that are making a lot of money off of those just people without well had a lot of money making money off of it because you could trade the swings but you need a lot of money to to be able to make money because the percentage difference isn't that high now two weeks ago there was 20 swings going on daily so if you had a hundred thousand dollars in the game you can make 20 grand pretty quickly in an afternoon so and a lot of people buy and sell quickly in and out right the you can you can see when there's a huge spike sometimes and what happens is is this like you can see the volume and what it appears is happening is yes somebody's somebody is say the price goes up to like point zero five seven right right they might have bought it somewhere just a little bit under it and then they sell like five million dollars worth and then the price drops and then they just buy back up can you set limits on there like i if it hits five five whoops can you do that yeah we it you can you can set like you know just like any other stock or whatever you can set things to to buy and sell somebody the other night uh had it where they had automated to start selling and they lost a bunch of money oh really yeah that's good that was that's not good yeah so if dogecoin goes up to 10 cents from five and a half and it's already been to eight uh within like four weeks ago uh it's the same as if bitcoin goes out to a hundred thousand got it because it's twice the amount right so these are like it's kind of like penny stocks i need stocks bitcoin is not bitcoin's more like amazon stock or something right or apple but dogecoin is like a penny stock where you know if it goes to 20 cents it's like five times the money but the problem is is do you hold and wait for it to go up forever right because a lot of people are just going to sell it when it hits a dollar similar to the gamestop function right here so if you're following game game stop so nice whereas everybody gets to a certain point everybody's like oh 350 i'm going to sell and they're like well everybody else is going to sell 350 so i'm going to sell 347 or 346. and then boom everybody just dumps their money a lot of these are automated see how the volume is and they're also automatic uh automated sell offers wow that's a neat chart yeah and not in all honesty i've seen that on your show all the time but i didn't understand it you just explained it yeah so that's what i assume happened here because they took discuss what their plans are on reddit so and if you know everybody's gonna probably hop out because it's okay to hop out because they feel like they're screwing everybody over if you sell but it's you know we're all big boys right here big girls we all have our big boy and girl pants on and everybody's like well 350 you know that's long enough to hang in and they're like well if shane's going to sell 350 i'm going to sell 349 and the next guy's i'm going to sell 347. so i'm not left holding the bag so it's a couple things here dave chris hi we see you doge democracy hey what's up what's up josh democracy if you guys are wondering who i am i'm his friend i'm tbf his token black friend here to help and a little fun today uh and uh somebody's asking why the 26 billion do you want to do that dave 26 billion was what uh it's kind of a recap of the week and uh 20 thank you for asking andres rico and uh it's uh elon musk made 26 billion dollars on tuesday uh we were just discussing that a couple minutes ago and i'm going to use binance to buy 300 worth of doge when i get off of this there you go everybody talked him into buying that was quick you already you already uh sold huh well i won like 900 today yeah and he also he played roulette today which probably has worse odds i wonder what the odds are yeah um well your odds of real letters are like 47. 2.7 percent something like that yeah or 47 and a half all together if you were to do you know some casinos now added like three zeros they used to have one single and uh zero the green double zero now they add the triple zero the sons of [ __ ] that is screwed up yeah because it really ruins your odds even more yeah especially if you you know black and red so young money i love you thank you thank you is it for him or me are you talking to me what's uh are you looking at me that'd be me nice now so ethereum no one ever talks about ethereum ethereum [Laughter] tomato tomato there you go oh here it is why don't i hear people talk about that as much i know it's as like big as bitcoin is all right tell shane tell tbf tbf yeah well that's also how to run uh the last uh year or two uh on the double black x i always play the same numbers and i had five dollars every spend on 29 and 32 and then 15 on 35 so 29 i sat there for like an hour 29 hit once 32 hit four times i think and 35 hit once so i finally every time i kept winning i'd put a black in the pocket although when we met blacks and the slacks we'd always say green and the jeans because we were the way we were bent greens in the jeans if you got 25 chip you put it in there but now i'm i'm bigger time i guess it's a hundred dollar chips yeah i put the blacks in the slacks i'll take a beer andreas rico says thank you dave highly appreciated thank you my friend you're welcome i am drinking pineapple cart um golden road you know let's let's talk about that people think i'm trashy because i'm a coors light guy i like the silver bullet i like that i can drink like 10 of these uh and they just god wants me to drink coors light you know we forgot to mention your some people might hear you talking about how you just won 900 bucks at a casino and that the bank's throwing six million bucks at you to buy more money and you're worth millions yep it wasn't always like that was it was not always like that okay i just did a podcast the other day and i was the first in my family to go to college uh i was in the military um i've worked about 70 hours on average a week for the last 20 years it's been crazy and i have an mba in finance and you know honestly i think before i gained a little weight i was pretty hot too people just see me and look at me across the room i've seen photos seen photos well black blue well that's blue for the wind he drinks coors light yeah and it has to have blue mountains and he doesn't even like a cold refrigerator it has to be in the freezer for like 10 minutes but not slushy but not the verge of freezing and it's phenomenal it's kind of a pain in the ass when it comes over i'm just saying young money bought eight thousand dollar doge at five point five six that seems a little high right well that's that's pretty much the rate right now so if you go on binance it's a little bit higher why is it higher i don't know if that's because they charge a transaction fee i don't know because and maybe so that they don't miss on the turn or whatever because they can technically they can do whatever they want nice oh this is a um this is a yeti and it keeps it it's like 20 bucks it keeps your uh beer colder longer so dave has it when are you going to do the show in your backyard dave's when i have people come visit i bring them to dave's backyard it's stunning i don't have a pool his backyard is like being at a resort it's stunning so well maybe uh if it's nice next weekend we'll do one in the backyard you can join we'll have everybody join so while you're doing this i'm going to get the but is it should i get the app right i'll get the binance app i'm gonna do that right now it's us though you gotta finance us okay so i'm gonna i'm not gonna talk if you see me looking down no disrespect i'm i'm downloading binance app as we speak yes so he's gonna so he's gonna go ahead and buy some doge live on the air i did not check the discord message yet uh i literally had to set all this stuff up but i'll check it after this uh for any changes you want to make yes so we'll do some changes whatever you want thank you for making that get so black x made the intro that i played earlier it's an ad i don't want the ad i want the other get okay get and if you try and use the wrong one it'll make you get the u.s one anyway yeah i got double click you still have to like you're not going to buy it today because they're going to verify your identity are they really yeah you have to send them a picture of your license and everything but i was i wanted to impress the people here that i'm buying uh doge right it takes like a day or two to get your account god it's very high tech i'm never going to be very high too i'm never going to be accepted it's very high tech it's still downloading it's very high tech all right so anything in the news you guys want to talk about uh tell me and i probably haven't looked at it today uh but we'll talk about it i'll google it any good tweets hmm besides that's blue uh oh there you go um when chris has it they price at a point three different so they can make money there you go there you go that makes sense well you know that stimulus check was meant for you so if you want to put it on doge i think you're fine to do that i don't know the difference between the two of binance and binance us i just know that it makes me do the finance u.s version i'd like to send you notifications so we're in california and you can only sit outside so our wives went and drank right now and there's a weight at pitchers she is not happy at 5 20. we went there like four weeks ago and there was a huge weight too and your wife's looking for a perk the fees are high so if you buy like three or five hundred dollars worth they charge you like a buck fifty sign up but it's a buck 50. so big money young money should i tell everybody my password no don't tell people your password one two three four okay comb the beaches we ain't found [ __ ] did joe biden really say not to use your stimulus for dogecoin i doubt but they definitely do not want people to use it they don't want people to save or invest that money they want them to spend it otherwise it doesn't stimulate the economy you got to stimulate this thing look at this how steady it is nice okay all right user does not exist i'm trying to register you're not going to be able to do it today anyway ah so the us version just direct is to uh report your earnings to irs so that makes sense the puzzle piece is making me put a puzzle piece i researched the hosh [Music] it's not let me do it you're probably not going to do okay yeah um so sign up now i think there's a lot of potential uh just because of the low price point on the uh is it i would assume it's pronounced is it hoagy if it's hoagy i'd buy it i love hoagies anybody from new jersey pennsylvania area it's on a sub it's a hoagie it could be a scam it's like a penny stock man a lot of this stuff is did i ever tell you guys about the penny stock how that works probably so be careful of that but they're just pump a dump schemes uh oh let me see what cardano oh yeah wow well it could be a buying opportunity it's kind of taking a big hit though huh wow look at that i just got my finance email okay i wouldn't do i wouldn't take the pictures on the of your license on the live stream just to just let you know is this a finance u.s yeah look still going down too dave i'm gonna be somebody i'm gonna buy doge all right you will be somebody and then we gotta get we gotta buy you a t-shirt because when you buy even the smallest amount of dough's coin you have to buy a t-shirt that's going to secure my account you know what i'm gonna go with that one it's only down four percent that's not too bad young money wants one doge that's only a nickel could be all right so someone's gotta have a good story that depends if you want the price to go down i i uh i don't know it depends on what your prospects are so it's a buying opportunity if you think the future is bright down the road i think in the short term it's going to be taking these hits uh so for katano sorry bad not financial advice hey let's

off water purification and then i became an officer so i was transportation fort used his hua uh and then i became a logistician and uh basically uh battalion s3 uh xl and all that so he does numbers and stuff and it's actually not about numbers no no what is a logistician it sounds like a logic like it sounds like a logistics with a rolled uh transportation quartermaster all those there's like two other uh branches but don't you have like inventory and all that stuff you that's part of it inventory like logistics right logistics legislation yeah that's numbers and organization and isn't that like the hardest thing to do when you have an army like it's not easy yeah it kind of [ __ ] hitler over right quite frankly it made i made it look easy you can't just send your whole army into russia and then not have fuel for them and kind of if you weren't here earlier i have a bronze star from afghanistan so that's cool brandon powell he was more motor t huh 11 bravo oh motor t transportation got it 11 bravo is infantry hua he's 11b was that he's in the army 11b means your army okay i don't know what a 3043 is wait wait oh morgany says tweet you about ufc but potential oh cool i'll retweet that when i uh when i see it or actually let me do that right now while uh tbf uh answered your questions i do have another interesting fact dave can i tell it about myself sure i'm gonna be uh finding these tweets so i actually am one of the few people in the world i was at world trade center attacks i was in afghanistan i've been to guantanamo bay not as like a uh you know tied up terrorists as a you know as a soldier and i was at a hurricane katrina so i got like a humanitarian award for human uh hurricane katrina the bronze star in afghanistan guantanamo bay one of my biggest regrets is they have a golf course at guantanamo bay and all my unit went and you got to use humvees they didn't have golf course carts in cuba gitmo they had uh humvee so you could play golf with a humvee and just drive that clubs there and everything and i was i had to stay someone had to stay in adult so i was the officer i said i'd do it and all my guys wouldn't play golf at ditmo and to this day i wish i would have done uh so the 3043 your uh supply in the marines yeah yours are different we're a two digit designator with a letter uh hints11 bravo so dave can you give me a 10 year old son a shout out on roblox how do i do that you have to be on roblox i'm not on roblox yeah do i just give him a shout out right now what's up roblox bots724 salvatore go grab your kid and uh type

almost legal here illegal in mexico coming up like in a week or two so i'm always confused uh my friend from the netherlands like when you say the dutch in netherlands in belgium i'm not that smart i should know that but i always get confused which is which well netherlands means low lands so that means there's water but it has nothing to do with belgium and uh uh the dutch the dutch netherlands yes okay they speak dutch do you know i think duff i think netherlands is the name of the area now i'm probably completely wrong i'm just guessing and i'm completely guessing but this is what makes sense and the dutch might be the ethnic group that has lived there for a long time right right and they live in the netherlands right you know what i mean it's like the anglos live in england right so so so i know one term and it's a curse word in dutch halo oh belgium belgium yeah well belgium is a different country it is a different but i always get the dutch netherlands in belgium i always get it uh well they're near each other speaking french french it was on jeopardy uh attachment uh belgium and netherlands oh get it dutch oven you know dutch what are countries that germany likes to go i mean like so it's like dutch oven is like when you put somebody's face under the blanket yes a dutch dutch oven yeah when you fart and put the sheets i get that uh chris i like the humor salvatores kid where's where's the one where they ride all the bikes everywhere uh isn't it belgium i don't know i don't know well okay the dutch speak french dutch but they don't have their own language okay never mind but there's soccer see what i know i soccer team doge astronaut you won 10 american u.s dollars actually to buy as much doge as you like with that money email me at dave at blue hair dave

the doge den he actually was on a rock band for a number of years so he's been to japan when he was early on 17 punk rock uh i went to japan when i was older and he has all these things up here so he was in several bands i've seen him play he's very he's a lead singer often times uh and then you did mark internet marketing made millions in internet marketing that's what he lived across the street from me um millions over the years not all in one year what's the most you've ever made and what can i ask that what's the most you made in one year i don't like to divulge that because the irs oh i don't know why that's bad but okay huh oh could you not oh oh okay let's change the subject well i have made more than one million dollars in a year yes wow and that's why you live across from and you only work like 20 hours a week right no he always gets mad when i say that so uh so you made 20 000. i have a lot of employees uh who make like 20 30 40 000. although my son's working for me now he's on track he gets paid hourly i pay him 17 an hour and he might make about 60 grand this year he's working like 50 60 hours it's crazy so young money you need you want to make more than 20 buy doge right that's what do you want to do young money i'll tell you how to get there now whether or not you're gonna do it's a different story right so that always bought so one of the things that's bothered blue hair dave is he can help you make money and people say i want to learn money so he'll tell him like oh that's a lot of work wow yeah nice sweet poke doge with a stick there you go oh so he owns roblox stock cool yeah well those just been kind of sitting at this price so it's not really doing much of anything so yeah when i when i well it's it's hard work is part of it persistence is a big part of it um but people fool themselves but hard work and persistence doesn't mean anything if you don't do it uh with the right goal in mind and so that's a big problem that a lot of people have and so i literally have had people like dave tell me how tell me how to do how could i how can i do this how can i make all the money how can i do this and then i'll talk to them about it and they'll say but no exactly how do i do it i'm like that's exactly how you do it and because i'll talk not in platitudes but in general things that need to happen whether it whether it's tbf uh buying a bunch of stores whatever he's doing it's still the same thing you have to stick to what you're doing you have a game plan you have to think smart and then you work hard at that plan right and most people just don't do that and or they quit and you also have to be in something where it's possible to make that amount of money so like people talk about you know ditch diggers you can work really hard digging ditches but you're still only going to make minimum wage digging a ditch just because that's what it does now you can make more money if you own a company that digs ditches for people right if you have a thousand employees digging dishes right and so you have to think about like how do i do this on a scale where i can make a lot of money right so or you could buy doge yeah or so for those who just logged in we had a couple people just come in uh blue hair dave's running this i'm his uh tbf token black friend just here to help today uh the 26 billion is about elon musk made it in one day so we're recapping that i just signed up thank you for those uh i use binance to try and buy doge uh it's a little complicated i still have to do it but i'll do that tonight i'm gonna buy hundreds of dollars of doge there you go i don't give recommendations on stocks necessarily because it's not financial advice on this station but or whatever the station tune in to 95.7 um i like to hold things for a long term with cryptocurrencies uh i don't day trade them currently so i like the long term play of them 10 20 years down the road so if you're young and you can get in on some of these coins while they're fairly inexpensive you probably won't regret it if you don't sell them down the road so i'm just saying but only invest money you can afford to lose because you're speculating and uh especially with these kinds of things and it's just the same as gambling hi uh dave kane thanks for coming in and for him i always wanted to go to iran i made it to afghanistan but i wanted to make it to your country i heard it's beautiful over there what are my opinions about doge at one dollar i think eventually it can get there there might be some big changes that need to happen with the coin um but crazier things have happened like what kind of uh changes well the the biggest problem is the supply on purpose they made the coin so that it's there's no bitcoin is super valuable because besides like being first and uh the most recognized which is its biggest advantage because it doesn't do anything really so um it's a placeholder for value and there's a limited supply and the further it gets towards hitting that number of 21 million the harder it gets to create them the bitcoin yes for bitcoin doge doesn't really have that it's just anybody can do those yeah but it is it valuable enough to mine is the question and as it becomes more valuable there'll be more coins added got it and then the supply gets greater which makes the price dip down but doge seems so more exciting right now but so so couple things that happen more people have to buy doge in like uh and use it and it becomes transactional then it could be and that was the other thing that happened this week if you weren't here the first 20 30 minutes uh dallas mavericks became the number one uh what is that retailer and doge this year this week yeah because they started accepting it and people uh bought from them so a lot of companies are using the uh momentum of dogecoin to advertise which is good for dogen for them so you know what i mean so they kind of get on and you know yeah nice and then for you uh yes i do invest in stock so i'm not a financial advisor but i started putting money in uh for those who didn't come on earlier uh i was i called my friend dave earlier this week because i actually asked somebody for six million dollars and they uh agreed to give me six million to three percent so i'm trying to buy business i actually went out to him it um i looked at some stuff today uh but uh for stocks when i buy i generally look at things i think if you look at where we're at with covid and everything and the economy what's going to be worth money in a year from now that might not be worth it today and you want to get in and hold for a long time that's what's nice about doge you're really in and out in and out if you want but for stocks you want to hold that bad boy for a while i agree yeah i agree i'm always a long-term holder so i started buying airline stocks literally like eight months ago and now they're going up were they low oh yeah they were so yeah i started buying their line yeah yeah it's like me and the banks uh after the crash in 2008 exactly except i didn't put in the bank of america i put it into son edison right and i they went bankrupt i agree with the david king we need uh elon musk to talk more about dogecoin yeah he's been real quiet he's only done a couple tweets lately so he's a father now yeah he's got a baby yeah he has a baby yeah oh my god do you know what happened today what you had a baby no j-lo and uh rodriguez uh a-rod stopped they the they're not gonna get married now they broke off the engagement i was actually upset about that they broke up yeah well they broke off the engagement hmm isn't that i i really was hoping that they would make beautiful kids together but she's like 51. bro she's yeah i think her little i mean her clock is ticked off already she dresses like she's like 30. so i gotta come she looks great yeah yeah but uh that doesn't change your so i was i was hoping that a rock looking good doesn't change your ovary situation i mean like i won't comment on that well we're gonna pretend like it's not yeah it's just five billion uh coins right i'm not joining the nfl a maximum of five billion coins per year can be mined for doge some means less and less the longer those exist air raids sirens went off in iraq as long as more people use it so if 5 billion becomes a really small amount compared to the amount used yes that is true uh congrats david king says she's leaving him from me so wow who a-rod he's your friend oh jayla hello and you know i would too you're you're a good man david uh every time you come on i just i respect you more david yeah david's a regular everybody here's a regular which is really awesome i like that so it's kind of like having 55 of your closest friends over so it's interesting i'm going to tell everybody this because i've watched this from afar like five or six times and this is my first time sitting here with dave hi orion uh light56 so when if i'm here with dave what you see is a couple of things obviously has several monitors but i can tell how many people are in here right now it tracks how many minutes the average person's in and then how many total people so when it says you had like two thousand three thousand views they all had to stop in for a little bit of time uh and they they go so right now we have 61 people can i say these stats is that bad go ahead i don't care okay i don't want to get in trouble it's my first he's never had me back again okay uh we're just getting started this is my second week third week third week third week why you always gotta go this is the third year doing this um and third year about talking about doge we've been here forever you just found us um but right now is 57 people watching uh the average time somebody's on is four minutes and 10 seconds and he's had over 600 people click on this to see what he's talking about so that tells me that there's like 50 of you that hang around the whole time and then the other 500 people come in and go what the [ __ ] is this and then they leave immediately so young money asked what's the most held in your savings account in your life so can i can i depress you young money um what's the savings account no the most i ever made and one one uh when i was i got my mba i got a check for 25 000 and i went to the bank and i tried to cash the check because what i was going to do this is years ago i'm old so this is back in 96. hookers and blow i wanted to get 25 000 and i was trying to do the math it's like doing dogecoin and i was saying that should i get like 10 sounded too cheap so should i get 20s or 100s and i was gonna throw like all the money on the bed and like sort of swim oh like at 25 like when you first become a millionaire you asked the bank to give you the million bucks yeah so i i was so heartbroken i had to call my mom i was truly upset because they wouldn't cash the check they're like well they we have to hold it they cashed it but we can't give you 25 you can't walk in here with a check and we're going to give you 25 000 cash we hold it a couple of days and release it some every day i was so upset dude so i wanted to sleep with like all these 20s and 100s have you done it since it's not that much money it's well yeah it's like it's like so young money it's probably like two stacks like this of 20s it was amazing um yeah he was born in 96. i'm a little older than you it was amazing on monday the most i ever made how does that make him 96. yeah got it okay um look at me with the math so i made a half million dollars in one year then the next year i made more and then next year i made more and then i started my own business and really when you go into business for yourself it's more about the equity in the business so my my i only make a little under 300 000 now but i'm actually worth millions more because i build up the equity in the business and when you say what's equity in the business it's how much a business is worth how much you owe and that so i'm trying to buy more businesses currently although uh can i say one more thing on this date or is it boring you can keep going i was even going to add something to have you discussed further so i i i've decided what i want to buy and i told my wife and kids and they think i'm insane what do you want to buy i would like to become a franchisee of little caesars i want to buy like five six of those pizza pizza pizza pizza they think i'm insane but so how much money do you make at a little caesars that's the thing how many have to own to make like substantial so say you're gonna buy or build a mcdonald's it's like two million dollars you can make about four hundred thousand okay but for little caesars to build outside three or four hundred thousand and you make about a hundred thousand maybe a little less so for like four for five of them i could make a half million and put in less than two million okay make that much yeah dude it's cheap like pizza's big problem yeah yeah an automated uh handout thing have you used that yet what little caesars yeah the little yeah it goes ready ready look at you you're a little so i want a six dollar pizza i want to buy a little caesars uh at lunch or five so yeah this guy's yeah he does he he does like entrepreneur podcasts and [ __ ] yeah i do i just did one yeah like we're both entrepreneurs but we're totally different types of entrepreneurs which is the interesting part right yeah so yeah so ronnie to answer your question we're mainly doge here uh a couple of guys on here uh like broken forge he does uh bitcoin and yeah go ahead yeah so i i what i'll review is anything you want but typically i'll follow gamestop amc bitcoin uh cardano ethereum and then the regulars like tesla dow jones whatever whatever you want to see i'll pull up though but we tend to talk about things in mostly doge uh and it really hasn't moved done anything so all day so we're talking about other things and also we have our first guest and since we're talking about business stuff because my channel really is about all things business whether it's investing stocks make money uh from home and stuff because my background is digital marketing uh and so we have a different perspective here and he's telling us about his stuff uh which is pretty cool because a lot of people are interested like well how do i get a business how i run a business uh and he knows how to run your business because he's already controlled over two billion dollars worth of business for a major uh company so and then went in to his own company to try to do his own thing i'm my own boss now he's his own boss now 102 amc shares all right what's amc at now let's take a look it had a decent day eight and a half but it was up to like hundreds of dollars right its high point was 24 25. oh gain stop was up to hundreds of dollars yes it still is what is gamestop right now uh 264. and it went back up to 347 was up to 700 i think one day oh no i'm sorry almost 500 so wow yeah thank you we see that uh 267 for game yeah so my son made like 2 000 in i think it was amc and then he bet it i say bet he invested it in this uh company that uh trades in all crypto and uh literally he was he was heartbroken because he got wiped out like half his investment was in like three days and went down oh so you know that buy low sell high he probably bought it the high didn't go well yeah you got to be careful you got to be careful i uh yeah i don't like day trading because it's too nerve-wracking oh yeah day trading's rough yeah it's easier now though they have the uh algorithms and all that so yeah it's still the only way you make money is with a lot of money though that's a start yeah so but you have to you know if you have a hundred bucks you're not really making money you know what i mean trying to squeeze out five percent here ten percent there so thank you young money that we're inspirational uh but both of us uh so you got two guys who work hard trying to make money our wives are best friends now i used to be dave's best friend am i still your best friend yes we're still best friends token black friend tbf best friend bff yes um thank you yeah thanks for uh thanks i hope we can uh you know why that's important to me is is because i was i guess you just call me a [ __ ] up for my early adult years i had a lot of fun but i didn't have my [ __ ] together i literally my my wife was like my sugar mama like she'd help me cover rent all that kind of stuff and then i know what it takes to go from being a drifting person that doesn't know what they want to do and can't seem to make anything work out and then making things work and then making them work over and over and over and over again so i went from not being male to make anything work than to having to reinvent myself because in digital marketing and online stuff you have to reinvent yourself like every six to 12 months exactly just what happens that's the way the business is so being able to make it happen over and over and over and over again and it's the the the simple the solution is pretty simple it's not easy but it's really simple and people always think you're full of [ __ ] when you thank you chris they got a tip oh you got a tip tip we got a tip we got a tip we have a valve we should keep our eyes on vet one and btt as well all right well we'll pull those up in a minute uh if you guys want to see those and thank you uh gaberto oh that's very nice so and i agree uh lock x selling at the high points i really i mean and that's the problem the only problem i had with doge am i allowed to uh am i allowed to criticize doge sure it's such a tight it's it's such a a tight trading range so it's hard when it's like point five so right now it's five five so if it can get up that's to even 10 cents 11 cents you can buy that dip and buy on the high so when people say buy at the dip it's hard to buy it to dip out of doge when the range is so tight so that's what you look at some of these other ones i think you know even like an amc or game stock if you're into that you know this is enough trading volatility look at me using big words trading volatility oh yeah you know you always do that with it are you the wolf of wall street what's going on i know i oh uh we did leave that out i have an mba in finance so that i do have those yeah that's why i'm structuring all these deals now um but yeah the trading volatility you have and like an amc and a game stock it allows you uh to buy low and trade high and that's where the real big money is risky too it's only risky if you lose well here's here's the here's the here's the equation of life though you have to risk to have high reward it doesn't high reward does not exist without high risk right right it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't exist so it's just the way it is gilberto says you need somebody in your corner sometimes that is true but if you open your eyes there are people there that you could follow listen to and that will help you in fact finding a mentor is super super important right would you agree on that i agree and you would be shocked at how easy it is to get a mentor because people like to share what they know and that includes super successful people who would want to be your mentor find somebody who's already done what you want to do and then just go hang out with them buy them lunch buy them dinner whatever it is and then they will spill the beans to you and then you gotta listen cause what happens is you'll listen to like 80 of it and then throw out the most important 20 because it doesn't agree with what your opinion is and that's probably the part that you need to change of your own opinion right right so um and that's that's what i found literally my attitude and outlook at situations was what changed my life it wasn't that i wasn't hustling because i was i was always trying something new but it was persistence at maybe the same thing over and over again to make sure that i got it failures didn't stop me uh they used to if you failed enough you'd be like well i guess this isn't right but what you need to do is fail and then readjust and then go do it again and then readjust what's up robey one kenobi and that was my biggest thing i was always blaming the world for my problems and other people and the system and then when i stopped doing that and i only blame myself my whole life to the 180. and if i could add to that uh for those of you coming in now i did admit earlier i'm worth millions of dollars now and i've been fired like three four times so getting fired if you're younger if you're one of the younger people i see a couple people who are young if you get fired a couple times man you got to shake that off baby uh worst things can happen you're going to read okay dave's going to get beer so i'm going to start reading some of the comments back to you so chris uh back at gilberto uh he uses one in vet young money uh do we think amc can hit 100 if dave were here he would tell you we're not allowed to uh give financial advice but you know it's tough when you look at the reddit forums right now and uh so for those who don't know the amc uh game stuff then i'll just tell you the reddit so what happened is you had um really some pioneers some people said look you have these hedge funds that are gonna bet and short the stock when you short the stock what it essentially is saying that i'm gonna buy the stock at a lower price and if it falls i will make money back so they saw all these shorts against the business model gamestop was in trouble before this happened and they saw these shorts so they started using it's almost like in politics now politics is changing because you have all these people doing small donations it used to be big people with millions of dollars but now the small donations make a difference in politics and you really sell that with the reddit and the gamestop and the amc so you literally had some billionaires lose a billion dollars and they tried to limit the trading so i think right now when you ask that question on i'm sorry for that long answer when you ask that question on the um will it get to 100 i think it depends on the billionaires and the regulation because what they what they don't want to lose is their money but you should have the right and the freedom to trade how you want to trade our stock market that's what the whole uh capital thing capitalism thing's about and then uh thank you i see uh syed hello good morning to you uh for those who don't know we're in california uh blue hair dave stopped out to get uh beer i am sitting here um it is 5 58 p.m here so oh thank you like x you like the long answers wow okay and gilberto wants a modelo he drinks modelo although he likes the darker one and i'm more of a light because if you missed it earlier i'm a coors light guy and uh cabernet i'll do cabernet all the time all day every day oh by the way so here's uh something i can teach you if you haven't done it yet go to costco and buy their cab in a box uh their wine cabernet sauvignon and a box it's like 12.99 it's the equivalent of three bottles and i was stunned stunts done stunned it's not that bad i would assumed it was swill but if you want to drink some cabernet uh try that sometime you heard it here i'm not allowed to give you uh financial advice but i can tell you about uh get the box cabernet at costco to doge astronaut i'll have uh dave uh he's getting me more beer uh so when he comes back we'll look and see if he got that uh thing he has stocks in that wine branch yeah costco for those who don't know is like a big uh superstore here that you can buy stuff and uh costco i'll tell you if you haven't been in a costco you better you better have a list because you'll be walking down and you'll see all this stuff and like i want to buy that i want to buy that but it's stunning on everything you get out of costco so and dave you had one question here um doge astronaut wants to know if you got the email by the way so i'll tell you another story about dave and i why he's getting settled back in dave and i like to watch ufc if anybody here if anybody here likes ufc but we're gonna do uh a fight companion my companion what's that we'll watch the fight and everybody else who's watching too and then we'll be able to talk about what's happening in the fight so our wives are disgusted with this because we'll do ufc and we'll have like a case or two a beer and we'll do a beer pyramid and it's not uncommon what have we done we've done like 30 beers in a a day it's a lot of yeah uh well i mean all 30 were him i'm svelte i would of course drink like gin and water or gen atomic he's a liar yeah but between dave and i we can knock back over 30 beers i'm very proud of that so doge astronaut got to see it got it why don't you do another drawing dave okay let's give away some money give away some money okay 20 this time honestly i take my 20. so this is okay black token friend i'm i'm on for the 20 right now so black this is a and he's writing it down because he will forget and send you 10 and you'll be here exactly uh so why don't we say ufc since we're all big ufc fans here all right i switched it up because i know you want to know because i would want to know i'm now drinking an ashland hard seltzer tropical cherry flavor it doesn't make me less of a man and i don't have stock and yeti but i use this yeti and it keeps your beer extra cold so yeti uh our sponsor our unofficial sponsor paul beer yes okay so you're gonna do oh for oh for those who don't know i'm sitting here with uh blue hair dave and so this is actually he and he just pulled it up he actually has a simulator so when you start putting in the ufc it tracks who put it in why are they typing ufc because we said it was gonna be ufc what the word that's what we said but i have to enter it first well then tell them right now okay starting all right start not starting yet okay hold up hold up a whole bunch of ufc's came through okay so starting now enter ufc so now enter ufc if you didn't before just enter it once now yeah well even if they did it before they still got to do it yeah because the bot only knows afterwards see how they add them uh so we got four eligible six six see a good one wow yeah seven so start putting in you'll see if you have it for twenty dollar of uh black token so we'll do we'll do uh maybe we'll do a fight companion and maybe we'll get uh uh broker uh and rage do you guys watch ufc rage and broker do you guys watch ufc he spelled it backwards uh because maybe if you guys do then we'll put you on we'll do like uh some kind of zoom and the other one was jack box jack box you know what jack box is no it's like an online game and we could have up to ten thousand people participate broker says oh yeah he does and for ufc it doesn't have to be caps right as long as you put in yeah it does caps don't matter just gonna spell it correctly how many people have put in right now so this is for twenty dollars you gotta put in use it for twenty bucks ufc and how many people have said uh thanks to thanks to the casino to make you yeah i won uh like 900 today at uh roulette so twenty dollar make you holler yeah so we'll do a fight companion and uh i don't know how that works but we can all watch and we could even set up in the kitchen and build gaberto we are in san diego uh i moved to i've lived in 10 states i've been living in a couple countries but we are neighbors so we're both in san diego the mcgregor fight uh uh roby we watched that here together and even our wives watched it with us that was a great fight yeah the oddisonia fight was not very good uh dave watched that without me yeah he's not uh do you still have it can i go watch it after this we do we can watch it it wasn't that great there were other fights on the on the car that were good then i'll go my kid is at somebody else's house and i don't even know what they're doing i know what they're doing curse on each other you feel better now though i do look at that so you have 52 52 32 32 eligible out of half the room it's only half the rooms in no i think everybody's in okay can we do something do lowercase ufc see what happens it says but some of them are upper case insensitive so if you did a haircase oh is this case the bot does not lie wow i used to do this manually and i had to pick a number and then i had to like hold up yeah you know what it is i think some people come in afterwards after they start and it's too late after you started san diego the whitest city in california no no that's not true that's santee yeah also half the population is is uh uh hispanic hispanic yeah so you know i was in and then the other like 15 or 20 is probably asian right uh it's a lot of asians and there's you know whites and some black i'm actually black for those who don't know so my whole life i was black and then i moved to new york and everybody thought i was hispanic specifically puerto rican puerto rican and they always talked to me and then 9 11 happened and people thought it was arabic arabic assalamu alaikum right and i'm actually black and so i'm in santee and some guy's telling me the story and he drops the n word and i you know it's it's a customer and i i that it's you know you guys may be better at this than me but i was like do i say something to him like you know i'm black like in the movies and i didn't say anything and then he liked me so much he kept talking to me but i was actually offended because he's semi-racist so what do you do when you're a friend with a racist uh make sure that you have somebody like me as a token black friend so i'm like oh you're racist no i have a black friend he's sitting right next to me so who won dave we haven't picked it yet we're leaving like a little bit of time here a little bit of time make sure you enter it it's for 20 bucks 20 bucks here we go ufc first amendment is that he might have well yeah well he probably well here's the thing bill byrd probably goes to la jolla for the comedy club oh yeah that's right la jolla is the lightest spot in the point it's actually a really rich mid yeah it's romney yeah mitt romney nah he bought a six million dollar house and tore it down to build his 25 million dollar house he still lives there though right yeah yeah of course yeah so mitt romney lives there yeah alicia keys lives there though does she yeah she built the razor she bought the razor house what like a 24 million dollar house she should come hang out with us i have a crush on alicia she's hot even without makeup like she's on fire even though makeup she's hot no doji coin isn't racist i don't know dogs can be racist so maybe nah i'm actually racist did you know black people could be racist everybody's racist are they kinda okay because people pick teams right i thought that's biases it is but racist is picking a team based on the way somebody looks uh other ethnicity and so it's human nature to pick a team and so everybody you know it's like and everybody's ethnocentric whether they want to admit it or not so like if you're from like you know you prefer like even just different states right right she like i like the way that my family and my people cook food i like the way they do this so we we want our kids to do the same thing that's not racist so so let's ask everybody so those of you been on a while i want to ask because dave's going to say should i come back again just say in the chat would you hang out with us again yes or no so would you hang out with blue hair dave and token black friend no yes or no no no no no i'm not racist i hate everybody my wife's a hot asian good for you obi i see that bill burr is from where to go row v1 kenobi so anyone's uh everybody's a little racist so yes i see you we're getting the answers yes yeah man yes if people say hell no people are very polite in here too are they yeah well you can't you're not going to say

friend put in btf if you want me here too this is my first time sitting here with blue hair dave so let's see some bts if you want me to hang out with blue hair dave again and paul sees putting in that uh what's the email did you just ask that same question no i said would you watch us again but should i come back again is that the same thing i thought it was maybe not maybe i just want to see him btf up there like 50 times no it's for his ego just type in btf any speaking of anyone remember the the zang fight i don't know if i remember i'm sure i would we watched so many fights he likes to go in person i do i want to which person which was cool when they were like 250 uh but we forget that 500 i'm not a ticket i'm now a multi-millionaire 500 i don't care how much money i have i'm not spending 1200 to sit in a nosebleed to watch a ufc fight so if you guys saw that anderson silva fight where he cracked his uh shin on who's that he was fighting chris schweidman right uh crack dave and i were there and we're in the cheap nosebleeds and we could hear that crack all the way up there uh youtubers exposed i haven't sent out all the ones from like a day or two ago and you are one of what's let's see where your thing is oh uh youtubers say where's my money yeah i get that once in a while so can i tell a story real quick dave yeah cause i'm gonna look up uh so when i got here earlier uh my friend blue hair day was angry i sent my kid went to this other kid's house sen send me an email again and remind me and i'll see if i had paid it and i'll send you the proof and um his kid went over there and they weren't allowed to have other kids there so he came back and texted him on the thing and they cursed at him like these kids are like 12. no 12. they're eight what boxing's 10 the other kids are eight and nine well yeah and then uh the other one the older one i don't wanna say their names my wife just sent me a screenshot and he said no god effing he'd spell that wrong how do you spell the f word wrong they don't know how to spell anything they're in third grade using saying [ __ ] [ __ ] ass [ __ ] our neighbors kids are literally saying on their ipads uh uh cursing out yeah my daughter just got home that's good yeah oh whatever so anyways dave was mad because the the question is you know you know and it was on my kids ipad i know he doesn't curse but dave was mad like how dare they curse up my kid and i've i got a bunch of kids man uh most of the same woman of course um so you know kids cursing each other so i don't know my kid pretended to type a word in and misspelled it on purpose and with like abbreviations and the things missing right like you would on a cartoon okay and we took his ipad away for two weeks these kids are literally trying like and over and over again that's why they're here listening to you you're a man of honor yeah i was angry so third graders cursing people out so we got a lot of bts so you guys would like to uh which is funny too because what he he's a third grader like if rockstar wanted to he could just beat him into the ground i was talking about ptf still have bts well you just brought it back up that's right yeah but dave was mad because you if you have kids no one wants to see your kid cursed at and cried and hurt and it was it was a sad moment and it's well my kid my kid's not he's he's an athlete too so it's it's not like he's a athlete it's not like he could just probably just i don't even know his kid will score like two or three goals a game it's i've seen how many kids so many goals so doge what's those at right now dave let me guess without looking [Laughter] five and a half cents wow look at this i'm a goddamn genius what about bitcoin five and a half cents i don't know bitcoin i'm gonna guess without looking is that fifty six thousand okay let's see if you can nail it bitcoin is you did look at you look at me okay i am an idiot savant heavy on the no offense to idiot savants i think we can get away in trouble for that now is it really no that's our word if you use the r word do you know what the r word well idiot is a different level of that isn't it do you know what the r word is yes are you gonna say it i know because you can get trouble for that why would you get in trouble for that can i do a live with up shot yeah sure i'll do it live with anybody that'd be great what's an upshot just don't ask me any technical questions youtubers exposed said they just mailed you check your email see if you got perfect all right let me see i'll handle this right now i don't see it oh it's in your junk maybe you got junk mail email oh i got it where is it no that's a different paul c that's doge astronaut uh check your jump oh there you go yeah you got it yeah you've been in my you've been in my junk folder but you're not junk we care about you yeah we're gonna put you not spam not spam and then i gotta remember to oh it's old now too no pressure so we got thank you youtube exposure we got you now okay i got you i'll send those out in a dare to checks in the mail checks on the map wink youtube 120 though right no no no paul c120 paul c120 oh yeah paul c20 who's the skinny dancing on the yacht supposed to be oh what what do you think it is oh that's the alien i thought you're gonna some well here's the thing we i think the consensus is that it's an alien and maybe doesn't have sexual organs most people assume it's a dude i said but every three nights a guy comes on here and talks about how hot the dancing alien is so i love the dancing i'm probably here just for the alien what's his name henry uh someone curses more yeah i'm not opposed to cursing yeah it's just when they curse at you and call you a [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] those are some of the same uh words as kids texted to your son today i didn't know those words until i saw my neighbor's third grader text them to my kid hey pierre what's up do you guys read the whack x right there what do we got do you guys think the blockchain techniques will prevail over btc eventually dogen bitcoin don't serve a purpose besides having value when v chain cardano etc actually serve a purpose well i do have an opinion on this bring it what's your opinion uh he doesn't own any crypto and we brought him on here to talk him into it uh i signed up for uh binary but finance okay so um i don't here's what i think i think that bitcoin's already set so btc is already set and i i see an advantage to not having a purpose because when you have a purpose you have a specific technology and what happens to technologies they become outdated so when you have a purpose for something it could work for five years ten years and then something else will come along and do it better with coins you'll see that other coins are more efficient at doing certain things and coins that come out that's all that needs to happen to take your value away from your cryptocurrency that's based on doing something right so if you imagine you had a cryptocurren based on renting vhs tapes from somewhere right just hypothetically hypothetically and then dvds come out now your coin for vhs is now pointless unless you upgrade it right so you become a blockbuster the coin the most successful uh the most successful coin is bitcoin which doesn't really do anything except for a placeholder dogecoin serves the same purpose so uh and that's on purpose so i don't i don't think uh i don't think that other coins have an advantage no because the only the only the only reason that people give them something is they're different than the other coins what's up uh dj so paul uh pbat major platforms and wallets opening up in the near future by the dips what do you think about that uh blue hair dave i think you should always buy dips i should buy low sell high nice and then back to uh youtubers exposed no dude if you didn't say anything you were in his john i just saw the folder you and the junk mail you wouldn't have got anything so no i never i would have but now that you reminded me i'm like yeah so he's like oh look at the spam and sure enough you're on the spam folder three emails why'd you put them in spam he said yes i didn't do it gmail did he's been a naughty boy a naughty boy naughty boy welcome to my spam room the gmail puts him in the spam for a regular email you must have done some bad stuff by the way email is like my professional thing so i think derek's trying to hit you with a conspiracy i love conspiracies but it's not sunday but it is friday so we'll talk conspiracy imagine crypto was created to pay down u.s debt think about it why does the us need to pay down debt i think we disproved that whole thing since reagan right so we've been spending money out the wazoo like a like a drunken sale or a whorehouse into reagan uh debt doesn't matter yeah because that was a big talking point uh for years that we have to get the debt down but the people that talk about reducing the debt were the people spending the most money and then we actually thought it mattered but we've spent so much money over the last 20 30 years that it doesn't matter does it is the dollar the inflation hasn't run away in fact inflation is almost non-existent for how many years 20 30 years no honestly i'm sitting here watching it i've known you for years now you sound really smart oh good job it's just it's whatever alex jones tells me to say is what i repeat i'm just kidding i'm just kidding oh infowars just kidding i think he's an insane person so why do you have his picture right there well gotta masturbate to something uh yeah reaganomics fran lewis look at you with the reaganomics look at you yes that just tells me fran you were alive uh like i was when that was happening so yeah do i think nfts are legit investment i'll tell you after i sell my dogecoin reggae song as an nft for one million dollars then i'll tell you by the way i have to mention uh i liked your reggae song i'm i'm sad that it didn't blow up i assumed it hasn't gone up yet how many how many uh how many views has it had it only has like a thousand or something so don't worry it'll catch on it'll win a grammy for sure us dollar is a weird altcoin in my opinion worth nothing and they mint new ones by the billions you're correct and the only thing backing it is the faith that us government will fulfill it well it's really our bonds that we sell too yes um but that's basically investing into the the the country to make sure that yeah so yeah but you're right the dollars are no longer tied to the gold standard or silver yeah or anything so yeah that's why that's the inflation so it's technically drive inflation and it's not right now it hasn't but yeah one day it will they're not tied that was a i think that was a so that was a false equivalency made for political processes so here's my chance to uh sound smart can i do that dave yes so you hear of uh inflation and hyperinflation and for those who don't understand what that means so what happens is when you have some of these countries you'll see like oh you know the value of the the what's the can the value of the the dollar that their their dollar lira whatever that money is uh was like one to one for the us dollar now it's 13 000 to 1. now it's at 90 000 so what happens is you have some of these countries and that's what they're talking about the dollar you can just print your own money right so what happens you get inflation sometimes and there's other things that cause inflation but you have different uh currencies and they just print a bunch of it and now really when it was really worth one dollar would buy one beer can they've cheapened the value of that paper or that currency so much then that really is like 90 000 of those to one beer can and you actually have had uh many examples of like literally you'd have to have like a wheelbarrow of this money and so all they do is keep printing bigger denominations so back in some of those countries that you know you always joke about money in the mattress right so in some of those countries if you literally hid money in the mattress uh so what another weird thing that happens a phenomenon is is as the money becomes worth less people buy hard uh hard items a washing machine a car so if i know putting money in the mattress is going to make the money read while talking i'm almost done and you can hit one of them so if i know that currency is uh being printed like crazy the smartest thing to do is buy a washing machine because a washing machine is gonna be worth something no matter what that value is or land or a business so you get this huge inflation when people like the us are printing all this money so what do you do i just told you the answer hopefully dave you want to read a couple comments i just found your channel because your epic dos reggae song at thank you [Laughter] the ad must be running i put that i put it up on an ad because i was like why is this thing not all over the internet i can't believe it so i just had to push it a little bit and put the song on and then advertise the live stream so thank you for coming let me see how many the song has thank you for coming well i it's an unlisted one what the oh the ads unlisted you have to make an unlisted one but uh the views for the song right we have yeah so but you won't get the how many people heard the song today from the ad i didn't know that it kicked in because sometimes it takes him 24 48 hours to start the ad so according to this thank you thank you you know what dave what you should play the song for everybody maybe nobody nobody i'm sure everybody's heard the song do you guys want to hear the song just one time dave please all right we'll play it one time i'm hurting mr dave give me a fix okay how hurt mr dave give me a fix all right i'll play the song and if you heard it before this is your chance to go to the restroom and come right back or get a beer i'm drinking coors like dave's drinking some kind of seltzer stuff so it can remain smelt no it's just i like the that and i actually all the all the beers i have in the fridge out that have a beer fridge are they're all like like ipas and [ __ ] oh yeah i'll get drunk i'll be on i'll be slurring this is dave giving her drives away for fifty dollars yeah there's something i'll be on the streets uh so this song was created by dave four days ago right now we're at uh 1100 views it's gonna pop up because he just put an ad out but you're gonna hear it here first for some of you all righty here we go whoops sound oh [Music] [Music] and this is blue hair days [Music] [Music] [Music] this is my favorite part go up i forgot i had the yacht how many times i hear that i just i feel good about myself i actually like that song and i've written songs that i wouldn't want to listen to over and over again that is not one of them that is something that i could are you putting us back on there we're already on you you can hear us you just can't see us it's not the same i know i'm one thing at a time you're you're you've been doing this for three years here we go turning red what's turning around me my face maybe it's all the alcohol you're drinking all right do you lose anybody sorry okay so let's read a few of the comments all right sorry let's scroll up here you have so dude you created a masterpiece don't apologize for being an artist dave now you're making me mad your your god-given ability to do as doge reggae should be recognized go okay that was the video i made for the song and then i also have an ad so i put the song one up so far uh david kane shared it on his facebook thank you thank you for sharing that thank you thank you david king and black x no i didn't put yours up because i knew that you had mentioned you wanted more control over it and you want to make sure that it is acceptable so i didn't put that one out yet uh because you created it and of course you want to exactly so i want to make something somebody did oh the dog farted are you looking at me like i didn't know the dog was in here said the dog park you literally thought i would have passed gas on geez a world renowned uh stream i would do that no so we can still make make changes uh all right so what else we got yes i think the song can make literally i think if the song becomes popular and gets into the zeitgeist and becomes like viral besides it i would enjoy that right just because i recorded it um but if it makes it could make the price go up right because if it ends up on the news or something right so all right look and see now doge is rising right now because of that he played the song i played it and went up yeah literally i watch this and it turns green every time you talk can you put this song on nft yes i'm going to sell it i'm going to list it in a million bucks a million dollars why not a million dogs because i want more money so wouldn't that just be like a hundred million dollars i'm gonna sell one copy of it for a million dollars but it'd be 20 million but here's the problem if it's not famous then nobody's going to buy it for a million dollars 20 million doge what 20 million doge is like a million dollars yeah so 20 million doge so yes we're almost at 5 000 subscribers and then i'll give away 100 bucks 100 bucks yes so just to recap for a couple of new people uh my name is sorry go ahead you're right lex i put it up there and it got like two up votes and i was like what the [ __ ] right i got two uploads uh two votes up like it was like maybe ten on reddit and the dos there's 1.3 million people in that subreddit and 10 people liked it wow i was like oh i think this must be terrible but yes uh so for those of you i'm new this is dave's been doing this for three years this is my first time here with him um my name is black token friend so you always want to have a black token friend uh so when people call you racist you can say no my my best friend's black so i'm not racist so i'm here to help tonight well you're like way out of the screen over here we got no i'm good it's it's probably my better angle here so that's good um so we've been talking about a couple of things today for those who don't know and her new san diego uh i'm actually a multi-millionaire we live close to each other our wives are drinking right now but our children are not playing together i'm not sure where my child is i think his child is upstairs mad so take it away dave he feels better he didn't talk about anymore he said uh and the dog is in the room and dave assumed that putrid smell was me so he just felt you have air pressure in here for that that's not the first time the dog's done that no i have that because i like the room to smell like wood it's wood air freshener it doesn't smell like wood it's like a fragrance it's like a lilac it's like manly wood it's like you know the only the finest mahogany yeah good voice for this do i yeah what's that i can make my voice sound whatever because i i can sing you know dodge coin or i could talk like this i've always wanted to do voiceovers well a buddy of mine had a great voice uh but he was not handsome he's actually very ugly i worked with him uh sorry dan but he always said i have a uh he's out there he has a tv face a tv voice and a radio face he's a tv voice radio face yeah yeah yeah but now you're on the internet you have to have both that's a lot of pressure it is well i didn't want to i hated to be on video when i first made videos for like a channel because i started the channel like last year so yeah so i've gotten over it a couple people are uh writing all the stuff to you what do you want to say who controls the price of d well i can't skip up with so when we all become doge billionaires who will buy an island and call it the isle of doge i think epstein island is up for sale that's funny that was on it baby uh as soon as the song played it went up to five and a half cents see there you go uh how can i earn dogecoin for free you can't because if you got it for free you didn't earn it uh please help in earning doge though and says who controls the price of doge and says the song was better with the yacht than the dancer on it the yacht's in there no matter what you had two yachts in there because you had the other one right what what where's the yacht part what about the very top song was better in my opinion with the yacht dancer on it and for the lego you mean having him the whole time yeah yeah well that's something yeah now we did have you missed that that's an alien uh the asexual or is it heterosexual alien we haven't named that we don't need to we don't need to be gender normative so for those who don't know it's actually a trend here in california and i think it's worldwide maybe i'm pretty sure but but some people know about the when you like touching the third rail you have to uh gonna get cancer you have to we're gonna get canceled now if people are starting to gender identify you can't get cancelled because you're a gay black man yeah i'm not gay i mean not flaming at least um you're black yeah you know that's actually a thing in atlanta a whole subculture of gay blacks hiding it and you're married but you're still gay on the down low down low down though down low yeah um if i if my wife ever thought i was gay she would kill me um by the way you know what another side because you lied to her because she's she's homophobic if i ever tried to divorce my wife she would stick a knife in my effing heart i'm going to say she stick a knife in my [ __ ] heart and kill me you're worth it your wife sounds murderous um we're coming up on 23 years if you missed her she's in good shape though my wife were on 37 marathons so when i married her people thought she was lucky to be married to me now 23 years later they're like how the hell did you get somebody this hot like because she's hot as [ __ ] so she is she's very fit very fast yeah yeah but she's black and that's not dave's type he only i've had that happen to me where i've been out

french benefits ones that might get you arrested and put in jail forever uh but yes what uh epstein allen yeah okay too soon uh see oh yeah i might not see i need a fix of dogecoin after hearing that song see everybody likes see it should be viral i'm gonna make it viral by playing paying for it i guess i don't care how that looks uh derek uh levine his wife would not get dogecoin in divorce court because he only has several thousand thousands in dogecoin us dollars worth of dose coin but he actually has more money in the house she's gonna want the house well here you're oh so your wife will she get doge you know she's gonna get the house yeah she's gonna go for the house and unfortunately the house is worth more right now and it's not in doge yet someday whose wife is asian no his wife

beeping when i do that then don't beat don't be kidding me it's an app where you chat you can share things but you don't have to like all the things that you want to do like on in a facebook group but without having to deal with all the extra [ __ ] so it's just like what you create and then you join use it for work or pleasure so if you have a work team and then you have like all these different how do you use it for pleasure that's really what i care about well we use it for players for all those saying thank you for my service thank you i'm very proud i get a pension in seven years go ahead how do you use it for your pleasure um well for for talking about like things like this or you put like memes up or whatever uh but some people use it just for work they use it for like you know engineer team one engineering team two whatever if you're building something or what i mean what's his name uh rocket's a rocket scientist our other neighbor he is yeah so we have an interesting right now it's like four of us pretty much right kind of that get together for the happy hour the other guy's gonna get jealous over here it's only four but yes it's four well lately because lately the guys that are available sometimes in the afternoon doors coin dildo company right yeah whatever hey if it breaks the price go up i'm for it and uh so uh uh what so it's me it's uh token black friend here and uh we have ed who's he's he's token asian guy took an asian guy uh but he's an actual rocket scientist rocket scientist yeah and he's from space i heard him say that once he's from space uh financial advice for man never buy a new mercedes let it age a year or two or three and then buy it and it's like new yes he buys his mercedes like three years old and saves like fifty percent on the price and then the other uh uh fellow he's a five actual financial advisor and he told me he could not come on here and talk about anything financial because it's against his license so which means he's probably not real advisor pretty sure that's his job if he were a real man he'd come on he's probably listening to this right now we should have him go come into that i don't have another mic though uh but he said he's not gonna come in he said he would but he can't talk about financial advice so what's going on i don't get financial advice you did no i didn't you said buy doge i said this is my opinion by doge i own doge and i wanted to go up boom well it's your show so i can say whatever so if i were you i'd go buy those right now i guarantee you will go up 80 percent i can't you're still going to get trouble it's not my show it doesn't matter do you say i guarantee you if you buy doge you're going to be a rich they're trying to arrest the antivirus guy right now for for a mcafee or whatever but what's funny is he's getting in trouble for promoting a cryptocurrency that he said he didn't have any stake in which he did but they're not arresting him for like his like cocaine binged child did he murder child prostitute whatever is going on but back back to what i was saying but i don't think he said worse things and i guarantee your doge investment will go up 35 tomorrow i guarantee it um you can sue us if i'm wrong is that illegal probably what is that what is that guy that's a spammer no pressure i know what that is um yeah so buy doge and you're gonna make a lot of money free shipping oh brokers forge look at you deleting messages he's yeah we got the best mods on the planet at this joint we're going to have a what we need to do is have a party here party like

shut up i was gonna say shoulda bought stock in yoga pants because like every single mom has the yoga pants on and so best invention ever can i just talk about i could i could have a youtube channel just on yoga pants thank you yoga pant and vendor um so made my day made my decade it's it's funny if you've never been to san diego like i lived in north i'm a big guy as you can see and i lived in north carolina and i was thin compared to the the fat you know fat people on north carolina i moved to san diego now i'm fat like everybody here is fit they are very fit state i need to move to alabama i'm like oh son have you lost weight no i moved to alabama mom well you just angered half our audience what alabama i live in alabama the great state roll tide that make up for actually alabama i like alabama's uh geography i've driven through there birmingham to northern georgia i like the way it looks it's not bad i don't like alabama i like it well i like uh i like forests yeah it's all trees we don't have really a lot of trees yeah one thing we can all agree on is yes yoga pants they're the greatest invention ever like the wheel yoga pants so you guys can look this up but they have a new type of yoga pants and if you're like fat it tones up your ass like they it will hold up this like spanx like spanx but they're special so when you look at these they're like 50 bucks it's stunningly they show women in normal yoga pants it's actually not so so i will say as a a psa public service announcement yoga pants are not meant for everybody we got to be honest here please if you shouldn't be wearing them don't it's like trying to squeeze uh like me wearing 10 pounds of sugar in a two-pound bag guys like me wearing a crop top like you know some men aren't meant to wear half shirts i'm not gonna do it so yoga pants you shouldn't do it if you shouldn't but they have special yoga pants that make you look good so sorry go ahead i don't know shane i think that's it brokers forge kevlar uh booty support it is is that a real thing that's the name of it look at you you know what dave we gotta do another contest all right let's give away more money we've already given away 40 bucks tonight and i want to throw another 20 on the ground let's do 20. because i'm all right all right so tbf is uh throwing in another 20. he actually has paid me 20 and i'm actually gonna start taking it now so yeah and here show them this for those who weren't here earlier i went to the casino on the way back i was gonna buy i'm buying another business i'm trying to and i stopped and i played roulette and i won a bunch of money did you show him the money i put it in front of the camera did i see it he usually loses when he gambles so sometimes i don't gamble much because i think it's a fool's errand but he has he he likes it his wife campbell's she's there with me till 3 a.m gambling yeah she likes gaming yeah so what's the word gonna be dave huh what's up for the contest um i don't know what's the word gonna be i need to figure that out how about um roulette is that will people misspell that uh yeah let's not do that um blackjack whoa you said it don't type it in yet okay blackjack okay so now you can type it in twenty dollars and i see for those who don't know he has this uh i used to think he picked people he liked he has this thing here um should have been yoga pants it should have been changing the yoga pants it's blackjack already oh blackjack so type in blackjack for twenty dollars you know what even yoga pants on somebody who maybe shouldn't be wearing yoga pants at least you know what you're getting right so yeah i kind of like that yeah for better or worse yeah so so blackjack i like to wear yoga pants with a pepperoni in my uh on my thigh excuse me ladies eyes up here eyes up here eyes up here yes i have to do it all the time at the gym that's a lot of black jacks so for those who don't know he actually has a program here so when you're typing a blackjack it counts everybody and then it randomly selects one of you but for tonight for the first time because i'm here this was my idea you can actually make people who are more regulars two times more likely to win and you turn that on you're welcome i love you too so how many we got in there dave so far we have 17 people entered it i think that's delayed because i can see like 30 and it only says seven it is what it is so eligible some people type it twice like wow yeah yeah that's what happens it's you know it's about 17. nice and this is slightly delayed yeah so so what we give it twenty dollars are you gonna write that down twenty dollars you got it so side note uh can you hold up the pen to the camera form real quick so one of my favorite oh i have a story about this one of my favorite hotels to go to is a ritz carlton in laguna niguel dana point california it's about 800 a night and uh i use points to go there of course but i had dave but every time i go i steal like 20 or 30 pins because i thought he was kidding when he told me this uh yeah i have like a hundred of these up in my office uh so i always steal their pants like a few sons of [ __ ] are charging me 800 a night i'm taking the pins i'm that tacky go ahead dave so he invites me and the wife up and we're like oh sure we'll go out for a night it's great location in the cliffs the laguna gorgeous can i interrupt so put in ritz carlton laguna niguel no they'll leave our station they can do multi-task they can listen so type in dana point ritz carlton and they'll see pictures go dude anyway it's nice um and he told me he was he i thought he was joking about stealing the pens because like what kind of low-rank guy goes around still beds at a fancy hotel yeah who paid 800 holy [ __ ] he literally would walk because they have like little pads of paper and the pen and this is not a bic it's like an expensive pen it's like heavy it's like you probably pay 20 bucks for one of these probably like if you know if you at work um and they have like you know at every little station past the bar and then like near the elevator there's a little pad of paper and a pen thank you in case you need one and he's literally walking down the hall putting always in his pocket yep but at a hotel like that they're never going to say sir stop stealing the pens because it's assumed you'll have enough grace and class to not steal the pens every one of them and he says well they're there for the taking and i was like oh my so i had a business meeting last saturday i literally bought a coffee oh my a small iced coffee was 562. are you kidding me 562. so i said can i keep the pen and he looked like of course sir so he steals pens everywhere he goes no no no no just the oh yeah yeah so we have like a meeting like harrah's in vegas and there's like 100 pens i'll take 30 for my business to use the pins when people buy stuff and pay out and then they'll say hey buy pins yes have you ever stolen like one of the fancy pens like uh what are they called uh yeah uh oddly enough i always get them so for those who are just coming on i'm actually very wealthy and rich i have like 15 of those in my room they're all i've been gifted i get them all the time gifted as then you stole it when you somebody handed it to you ritz carlton baby oh my gosh so yeah look at ritz carlton dana point laguna uh dave spent the night there not in the same room with me but he i took his family there you didn't like it though i don't think you were impressed it was it was nice it's not your cup of tea uh i don't enjoy it as much as you do so for for for double the price i could spend a week in mexico at a hotel that's actually nicer so that's how i that's what i equated to you know what i mean so broca's forage i'm going to read what you wrote free pin thanks another free pin thanks wow another one it is like a pen easter egg hunt for adults exactly baby that's what i'm talking about i guess so so who won nobody yet keep entering um so the mont blanc anybody who's ever been gifted one or bought one do people buy them for themselves it's always a gift right um you can you know you can buy it and say people could pop this feels like a monk i probably couldn't tell the difference between my mom blanc i got a mont blanc at one of my jobs one of my first big boy jobs where i wore a tie and uh and they charged me they it was they it was remuneration and they took out like the taxes out of it and then i had to pay taxes as income so the pen was income and i was like well [ __ ] you like so a little the pen cost me like 120 dollars i laughed like i was laughing at you what you're saying i was actually laughing at a post okay and i'm sorry you looked like oh is that funny no and wrote 562 for a nice coffee it's 1936 in new york shut the [ __ ] up is it really 20 for iced coffee in new york right now i wasn't i was there a year ago and it was the same price it was like 5.95 or whatever so derek levine honest question are you ready yes if you type in blackjack more than once does that take kick you out of this or something it's supposed to nightbot does that sorry we'll pick the winner right now here we go roll it i said that 32 people dj dj you just won dj is dapping in this thing so is dj still there huh must be president to win dj so dave at blue oh jesus hair day plan dot com so email me there and let me know if you want vemmo zell or paypal dj won 20 dollars i'll go get it we gotta go get it this time i gotta pee anyway so what do you want what do you want me to talk about okay whatever while you're gone should we keep this going it's two hours and fourteen minutes ah so let's shut her down dave we're ahead we're killing it hello i said we're killing it one more beer okay while you walk out so i guarantee you will make 20 return on doge if you blue hair day says what blue hair dave guarantees you'll make a 20 return so if you just got here we're going to be here for about 15 more minutes uh we're drinking beer it's friday night our wives are together drinking right now i don't know where my kid is so we're in uh san diego oh my god it's 6 53. my wife's gonna be pissed like you left our kid alone all this time uh so tonight we talked about a couple of things um i'm a multi-millionaire so next time around i'll tell you my uh story we took a vote to have me on and uh i buy uh businesses so i actually called somebody last week and said a banker my lender and say i need six million dollars and they said they do it at three percent so three percent is crazy for a six million dollar loan and some guy is offering to do it for me it's really hot i'm excited um so for tonight what we also did is four giveaways we did two for ten dollars uh two for twenty dollars and if you haven't heard it yet we need you to look at the dogecoin reggae blue hair dave back in the day was a semi-famous musician he's torn all over uh here in san diego he was huge so blue do the uh the deutsche coin reggae and then lastly we have agreed that the dancing person the little alien there we haven't given it a uh sex so we'll see um and for julian fix do the doge dance we actually need to come up with it and thank you elon dave's very proud of the song he actually sang the song because he was a singer back in the day and then for the future for those of you come back dave has an automated program so when we do the drawings make sure you only put it in once derrick levine is telling us if you put it in more than once you get eliminated so only put it in there once um how you buy businesses give me an ebook so essentially i buy what they call cash flow businesses when you say what's a cash flow business it's something it could be a laundromat a subway uh you know a blockbuster whatever something that makes money so you're buying it at a multiple of what that business is worth so for example you buy a subway it's making a hundred thousand the month ball on that's about four times so you gotta pay four hundred thousand so i always say when you buy a subway you're really buying yourself a job because you can work there full time control everything um so oh thank you token black friend so i'm tbf uh token black friend this is my first time here with my my neighbor and one of my best friends did i just say one of is that like i'm cheating um blue hair dave if i have more than one best friend i think my daughter has three best friends but where i grew up you have one but my best friend growing up was steve i didn't have five best friends but thank you fran louis uh tbf this is my first time being here and uh dave is one of my best friends i just did it again but uh back to that your question so when you're buying a business it's really easy you got to decide what you want to buy get the price and get the money oftentimes you can buy like 20 30 down and borrow the rest so when i'm borrowing 6 million dollars at 3 in this case my partners are rich so we're only going to put down about a half million so we'll put a half million of our money in get a business we're six and a half and then i truly uh i have to run the business that's my job i run the business i have a record all my people last year so i'm gonna brag and turn it back to dave was he's getting back on here now last year was a record every person who runs one of my business not a single person quit uh one person quit on me the year before and we fired two couple years for that but of all my uh managers not a single one quit last year i am of course light beer god i love you all go back at you oh wow look at you're very popular look tbf is a great host while you're gone i told to put that up there oh hype me up baby hype me up but thank you for the compliments this is my first time doing it how do you buy businesses give me an e-book i i would just walk through that for them that's what you missed all right so who won didn't have we just already did the contest yeah but who was the winner dj i gotta make sure i keep track of the twenty dollars right for twenty dollars because you gotta center ten like what a rip yeah i'll steal your pen so we're gonna uh close out in about 10 minutes any other topics you guys want to talk about we're going to watch the ufc from last week i have to go get my kid dude where is he i think he's out with isis my daughter just texted me said did you order pizza um look at dojo and that was like 30 minutes ago she texted me again there's a pizza at our front door so i brought in in case you did should she eat that pizza if it's a random pizza i've never had that happen have you ever had a pizza show up your front door went to the yacht party we should bring yeah there you go everybody can do blue hair i don't have hair you're discriminating it says bald people is that discrimination we talked about racism earlier and i admitted that i'm i'm black if you can't tell and i'm actually a racist on some level he has to say that because he doesn't look super black people don't think i'm black so oh i have a story go ahead can i tell a story okay so one of our friends is a former nfl player and a current uh coach of the buffalo bills oh yeah and so we're at some easter thing in our neighborhood and i'm talking to him and uh whatever blah blah blah blah and then tbf walks up and he starts making like black jokes and uh our other friend is very large uh ex-nfl player clearly black clearly black clearly black and tbf is not clearly black sometimes and so he's kind of like what the [ __ ] so that didn't go well when they met well so i don't like this guy i don't know if you know this dave what like he's listening well you know it's your fault okay i'm just gonna put out there you i don't like because i've introduced my i come up to him every time and he's like hey i won't say his name like hey i'm the only black person who lives in this neighborhood beside you no i've met you eight times actually uh tony junior but uh i want this oh we have a very racially mixed neighborhood uh but as far not a lot of black people in san diego there's like one in every block in our neighborhood so anyway so every time i meet this former nfl and we're at a party i've seen him like nine times every time hey introduce myself hey nice to meet you i'm like this is this seventh time the eighth time the ninth time we met so it's crazy i don't know he comes up gives me a big hug and said what's up dave what was that running back from the uh he went to the panthers uh tolbert tolbert some sproles my darren sproles and tobert living my wife and i have three kids and i'm walking up and this white lady and she's a little heavy set which is surprising uh she comes running heavyset white women older running down the driveway she comes running to the driveway at me my wife and three kids and uh we just moved in and said oh are you the black family that moved in up the street like yeah is it black or african-american like i don't know what to call you people and our son comes down on cue and he's like oh my god he knows this is a train wreck and we're like yeah and you guys just moved here from north carolina we're like yeah so uh he says uh i i have good news for you well like what she's like i sold my house to a black person well oh okay and you know happy new year black person should but yeah it's uh tolbert so he's a running back for the san diego chargers buys a house like literally 12 houses from me and dave he said do you want to see my house well sure so we go through so this lady we never met is happy that black people moved in up the street she sold her house to blackboard so she gives this tour of the house so before uh tolbert moved in his house i was in his backyard chilling man so i took pictures of it because i thought if i ever want to impress people because there's a stunning house they have like the pool so you walk in the back door covered uh we live in a great neighborhood and imagine the patio with the outside kitchen then the pool and then beyond the pool is the basketball court he had the laker one right was that him or is that no it's like two houses down from there um so yeah uh darren told ran his house but yeah we had sproles tolbert gwen still lives here tony gwynn jr um a lot of athletes we had a uh uh the church singing dude we had a christian rock rock christian rock rock star but i really never i didn't know i didn't meet him but yeah we heard about he was only like five four houses down the next block we should start a room i think they got divorced didn't know really maybe his wife was i guess he was real real big in the christian rock but she hung out with the center because i won't say the name around the corner oh did she yeah that lady was a sinner we've had all kinds you know what living in the suburbs isn't quite as bad right so because i i i spent my most of my adult life living in pacific beach in mission beach which is as urban as you're gonna get in the beach community right in san diego uh it's actually pretty high crime a lot of homeless people and you think oh it's going to be boring when you move to the suburbs the stores so yeah there was like there was like a cross like people literally got divorced and moved like there was a crossfit guy careful if your wife does crossfit so several affairs several affairs with several different women and they all left their husbands for the one dude so there's this crossfit dude and they're all getting in a crossfit and he was banging all the wives at the place and they all left their husbands for this dude and then they all find out that he's just kind of banging everybody who's he's crossfitting so but personal trainers as we'll probably have big sean on here big sean uh and uh as he can attest to that uh and hervin pervin has stories of women hating their names they're gonna i don't know i don't want well it didn't happen i was married i mean like or did it you gotta know that anyway women hit on personal trainers can you yeah so on that dave i think we should sign out it's been a while man okay okay i gotta find my kid sometime all right yes we're gonna sign out and this was oh my gosh two hours two and a half hours like ten minutes all right thank you everybody for listening thank you i'll i'll be back on tomorrow i think uh i'll wear yoga pants i'll wear my yoga pants and i actually have uh yoga pants like like athletes they're not like from men they don't tight up on you like if i could rock

today's review we're gonna be checking out the choices carts and i'm gonna be trying out the king louie next review we'll be busting out the juicy fruit all right open this from the bottom uh here's the cartridge it's a ceramic cartridge which uh this is honestly my first time trying a ceramic cart and i gotta say i really i'm digging let's go ahead and throw this king louie on this this little mod i got here but uh here before we i'll try to hit this let you know what it tastes like okay got like a berry almost yeah it's like a berry flavor almost i know i say that in a lot of reviews but those usually tend to be my favorite uh flavors but before we hit this let me get a drink of water and yeah we'll get right into this review okay so man i'll tell you i'm ready for this it's been a long day started my new job and man to say the least today was what a day uh my new client was awesome she was chill but some of the things i had to do today was just not enjoyable in the least i'm ready for this man wearing a mask [ __ ] eight hours that sucked but cheers dudes hope you guys are vaping along smoking along rolling your joints hitting a dab i may take a bomb rip at the end of this video i got some in my uh i always carry this is my everyday carry i just carry my dugout one hitter i got some cbd in the bottom mixed with some kush i'll [ __ ] throw a bowl in that but let's get right into this boys okay so for some reason first time you put a card on this says low atomizer or something but here let's hit this cheers boys really smooth uh it's a clean like usually to me carts aren't really smooth on my throw like they usually burn my throat that's honestly why i haven't been doing cartridge reviews because i just i don't like the way they personally make my throat feel afterwards i mean obviously me carts are a little harsh on my lungs so if i cough a lot don't take it too seriously or think the car is bad because it's not it's just my lungs but before i hit the skin so i don't cough snag another drink of the water oh and the aftertaste of this sticks in your mouth so uh so well so those one hit i wasn't high before i started uh before i started this video so just see how many hits it takes me to start feeling it and about how long uh don't mind the beanie i'm just wearing it because my hair is kind of messy and yeah my golden state had was supposed to come today naturally didn't come everything was running late i had some cartridges [ __ ] my dude didn't get his till late so [ __ ] put me half and wait to try these which i'm really glad it says uh lab tested and ensure potency no pesticide no bleaches no clay is made from uh made from 100 absolute pure delta nine distillate you can tell this is a black market cartridge just because the worrying that made no sense no pesticides no bleaches uh and then it said no clays and then it doesn't put a period or anything it just says made a hundred percent from absolute oh it's gonna appear oh okay i guess it does i'm just reading it wrong i don't know you guys tell me if that looks weird maybe i'll i'll do um maybe i'm starting to feel this car uh they say they're passionate about our products we pour our hearts into our products we understand the consumer should always be first only organic terpenes says our product contains organic terpenes and never will contain pg and other harsh chemicals ingredients it says premium donut9 distillate and the terpenes of course it's got your scratch scratch there for your code put that in your camera take it to the site you can check the see if this is authentic and i believe i did check this uh specific card it does tell you um like it's got all the tests like there's a lot of tests that it says it ran and it'll let you know if it passed and what it was i believe it uh i only seen the juicy fruit i don't think i seen the king louie but i'm pretty sure the uh the juicy fruit was tested in that 85 like i said i don't know if that's true it's pretty easy to mimic and fake stuff online so don't be one of those guys in the comments saying yo you're [ __ ] vaping dog water or hot dog water or some [ __ ] nah bro it comes down to who you're getting off of and honestly i've been smoking for years now i'm gonna know what i'm consuming not a hundred percent you know they could be bad [ __ ] but i mean that's like everything let's get one more toke i am feeling good off that one hit like i said it was a pretty decent hit but let's get one more also i'm vaping this at 5.2 watts if you were curious i also says full ceramic cartridges free no heavy metals and then it says no metals whatsoever which i mean if you look at that cartridge that pretty much looks just like ceramic i mean maybe after i finish this i'll go ahead and try to take it apart see if it's actually ceramic and yeah but overall i like the carp presentation it looks nice it's not over the top you got the nice see for choices and yeah overall i'm pretty uh i'm pretty happy with this i would say if you find in your area snag one yeah i'd say definitely try to snag one of these if you if you can find these in your area grab one try it out i would highly recommend if you can find the king louie snacky king louie so good um smooth i don't know if you guys want to see the bubble test i don't really ever do the bubble test anymore because i feel like it's pointless but as you can see that oil's not moving and there's the oil color as well let you guys get a good look at it [Music] there you go pretty nice color to it very very light golden tint pretty good oil overall i would rate the uh flavor i would give this a solid i'd give this a solid 8 out of ten it's pretty flavorful stays in your mouth kind of coach your mouth with those terpenes uh hi like i said i took about whatever it was two three hits i'm feeling you know starting to mellow out feeling good uh actually i kind of want to take a blinker off this this thing turns off after 10 seconds i believe to make sure you don't burn out your your vape uh this was originally for um like a regular vape like an e-cig but let's go ahead yeah i'm really ripped dudes this is an indica as well the king louie is or it says it's an indica which i would go with that does feel pretty much like an indica i'm like real chill laid back here we go boys i'm gonna take a drink and let's hit this believer in this video also drop a like uh hit this subscribe button over here i believe it's down there hit hit that subscribe button for your boy and uh yeah let's do this boys hopefully taking blinker with me if you are let me know how long your blinker is and uh yeah cheers let's get right into this get my breathing down all right let's go we're gonna go until this turns itself off uh my body feels nice and warm we're chilling you can see in my eyes we're at that level [Music] song again all right boys i'm not gonna cut out any of the coffin i smoke a lot of cigarettes so i'm gonna cough it's just part of it honestly you gotta cough to get off um come on where's my where's my lighter all right [Music] but yeah if you guys would like to see the juicy fruit be reviewed let me know and i will drop a video on the juicy fruit by choices good thumbnail okay and yeah i hope you guys enjoyed this review um potency i would give i'll give a solid 8 out of 10 as well um yeah i can't say i can't really say anything bad about them they don't burn your throat like after you you may cough but it's like a normal weak cough it's not like that my throat's burning because whatever is in the cartridge is not supposed to be there but yeah my sinuses are draining so i'm going to wrap up this video spin your boy exotica i will see you guys in the next one peace",

reached tanyard gap interesting man i bet in the heat of the summer this is like mosquito city all right it kind of stinks i don't know if i do that sarah says it stinks we should go ahead and go first we want to know if we could probably swim in it like if just people could but yeah i don't think i don't think that's safe don't think that's safe but it's fun following a dirt road we just passed that pond and then came out onto this little clearing here which is kind of neat first of all we haven't seen a pond on the at before and then the clearings we've seen have been like pasture lands and i hadn't seen private property signs anyways kind of neat and sarah were talking earlier about how we've been hearing crickets we don't normally hear crickets on the a.t kind of a welcoming sound i remember when when we first hiked the a.t i stayed up like 3 500 feet all week and we just never heard any crickets and that was just different for me so we're always camping by a lake and stuff so i always hear crickets and cicadas but it was so sounds of crickets quiet skates are kind of comforting and the breeze is coming yeah there we go i got new trail runners on this time they match sarah's ultra ultra lone peaks so far so good all right it's telling us to take a left all right our first kind of road walk of our at experiences now we go back into the woods up we go off the beaten path we go yet again foundation an old building all right we're back on the same dirt road that we just got off of maybe a half mile a mile back walking over some interim well it's not interesting some road and we're going to have lunch on the other side and it's going to be very pleasant and peaceful not because we've already heard like tons of cars oh the white blazes are on the sidewalk oh my bad just came from there all right same shame the mountains in the distance i don't think you can all right lunch time my hair lunch break at tanyard gap we were able to find a little spot in the woods before we go back up there's like 20 000 boy scouts apparently there's so many they just i thought that they were like 10 when we saw because we saw them at um hot springs um there's like 10 and now there's like 21. they're multiplying they said pimdas equals xyz so they're heading the same direction we are hopefully they're not staying the same place we are hopefully they're so young they're gonna go on the extra three miles to the shelter and leave the campsite to us girls well whatever we're happy to have company but we were able to come down here and we have got food explosion wait where's it at food here let me see food explosion all about right there oh this is all of our lunch for four days the mosquitoes are still out in october down south and they like my face and my ears they don't care about her follow us in the air so pretty more steps you need help oh you're going to rip your pants hey those were expensive oh gosh those were like 90 bucks i think never mind you go they're really nice like cold weather running pants which it's too hot for right now oh my turn yeah yay you got it yes ma'am i think i have shorter legs than you yeah you do this is going to be a challenge for you careful oh you did that a lot easier than i did i got the chance to watch you first yeah those are my mistakes [Music] you blend in mister almost got stepped on oh he's just zooming where are you oh bye oh yeah this is actually kind of nice i should just switch up here sarah cool oops step up of course we'll get wind this is a 0.15 mile trek up so pretty is there wind down there we need to get in the corner and see if we can get this flame going and eat our dinner oh [Music] cooking dinner in the fire tower got a fire and a fire tower that's when to eat actually hey sarah hopefully we can eat and miss the rain and get back to our campsite dinner my boss is so silly with spicy chicken the wind all right so over here we slept with chocolate covered raisins right there and then that's the remnants of the bag they took a lot of raisins there's the hall and pooped in the bag yep got our raisins putting that up so we're gonna put that in the trash bag sarah's gonna move her clothes over there [Applause] i'm so scared she's scared it might be a little mouse all warm and fuzzy that mouse got a lot of raisins he is not a very healthy mouse right now bro chocolate covered the actual yeah so we spent the night with some guys that weren't nobody hung everybody huh but all of our food was in this nice bag here way inside the tent and then nothing touched that but her raisins were right there on the edge of the tent uh see this is why we shouldn't get what's it called peer pressure peer pressure to do it but we know it's not right i didn't feel anything walk across my face last night so that's good now it's raining and we have i'm gonna wait morning soon good morning so hopefully about ten o'clock that hurricane weather is amongst us ugh all right bye on to the shelter we had a good night sleep last night but it started to rain well i woke up at two to go to the bathroom and uh the guy next to us was snowing pretty good and i actually felt kind of rested it too i think we turned the lights out at eight or nine um but anyways so i wasn't asleep until 7 30 this morning about 5 o'clock it started to rain really bad so we thought there was going to be a break in the rain between 10 and 11. we got out of camp at 10. it's raining pretty good but i think we did a pretty good job of staying dry at least keeping our nighttime stuff dry i'm having trouble here lately on the last couple trips pitching our tent properly so we're just not getting our our ground cover our footprint nice and taunt and that's i guess huh not what the deal is but we just had a little rain seat through but not not enough to cause any damage or whatever but we did have the rat mouse whatever come in and get chocolate covered raisins that we forgot were in the pocket so i don't know that that is very healthy for the mouse because he ate a bunch unless he was feeding his family anyways 11.2 miles today to shelter and we might actually figure out what shelter life is like on this trip for the next two nights because taking down a tent and pouring rain sucks and that's what's going to be happening all right here we go i don't know hunting on trapping no guns or dogs allowed except during man manhunts fishing by special suns up something if this is important they should probably come redo all right almost at the shelter for lunch i love the shelters that are right on the trail we've only seen two of them so far this being the second all right time for lunch okay still a green tunnel in october those are the rhododendrons just with no blooms okay just to walk in the woods the trail is covered in such pretty fall colors but what's underneath these leaves rocks slippery roots who knows but it is so pretty so we were able to take off our ponchos and the jacket i had underneath and i had rain pants on i've got some new hiking pants on i really like them they're very lightweight hopefully they'll work in the summertime too i didn't get a chance to test them out in the 90 degree weather which is what i really wanted because i have warm weather hiking pants but these i got after i got those terrible mosquito bites about took me out um but i waited too late to purchase them and so summer heat is gone down where i live so and apparently here in north carolina tennessee too so uh we got about we got about six and a half more miles to go it's two o'clock we got five and a half of that is uphill so we shall see and we need some water before that five and a half mile climb at least a little bit just so we can sip i don't like to carry water up major climbs like that sarah does so you can have at it i'll take a half a bottle maybe there's water at the shelter all right hopefully the rain severe rain anyways holds out until we get to the shelter i really hope so it was really windy and when we stopped for our lunch slash late breakfast it was really cold there's such a fine line between getting wet by the rain and getting cold or sweating your butt off under your hiking gear under your clothes whatever so then you just wet anyways the good thing is we do really good at keeping our nighttime stuff um dry so we have that to look forward to anyways all right i fell in the snake part oh yeah you did right after the snake all right we have our first fall it's like she twisted her ankle or something it looks okay it's like right here yeah i'm just gonna sit here for a little bit and uh wrap it you wanna take some motrin yeah and take some mudroom all right first injury of the trip not bad we're several miles in it did good i'm just glad it's not broke oh my gosh your look sorry that was just you scared me yes i could tell it was i was scared to take your sock off which is right there oh by the way speaking of socks we think we may have a new cold weather slash wet gear wet weather socks this is like it's like waterproof and so far so good right your foot's dry yeah yeah she's had it on all morning and uh i got some on too i think uh i think i'd like to wear like in genji light because i normally wear it in jinji well we both were in jinji trail socks and i think i'd like to wear some ngenji liners i went really thin with these i don't really like my skin on my toes touching me that's so far so good minus the hurt ankle all right let's see what happens my foot's been visited by jesus is so white you can see where i uh ripped my skin open a few days ago i think i stepped on glass on my other foot and then i was sitting crisscross applesauce at the house yeah so where does it hurt exactly ah right where you're touching right here yeah sorry i'm being loud sorry here too you were just right here oh my god like all right here oh yeah yes you just twisted your ankles i'm sorry oh it's all dirty oh my god i'm a pain are you talking about my foot here no it's actually fuzz from yourself okay because i do have foot here and i'm very insecure about it video taping yeah you're about your foot here yeah i'm sorry you just keep turning it roll is twisted the wrong way i'm not gonna go i just bit my toes which hurts by the way i don't know if you need that medical information but you know there is fuzz in between my big toe my hands are soft that's gross you're a good nurse thanks yeah i can practice actually i don't don't do this at all there's a feeling in my i don't want to sit down with this is that the hack i don't want to sit down on the muddy the muddy ground okay my thighs aren't that strong but okay yeah i'm sorry i'm not strong oh that's okay [Laughter] okay this bandage has been used multiple times just let it rest well here we are yeah like look i think this is where you did you're slipping right here it's like well i i like i stepped on my heel or something sideways and then i tried to like regain composure and by doing so i picked my foot back up to step again like grab myself before i hit the ground and when i did that i stepped on it sideways the other way or something and then i just you didn't start rolling down you did roll yeah i thought yeah i thought you were just gonna go straight on down that downhill i don't know if y'all can see it in the video but this is like that's pretty steep a good 45 degree angle or something it is sorry well folks i'm coming it doesn't look like we're going to make our shelter site tonight because she really did a number on her ankle so we were trying to get her on here to the road she's going to sit there i'll go get some water and then it's point two to a campsite that we know about so we can go there it's three o'clock let her rest through the night and see how it feels in the morning but uh yeah or we might just get down here to the road and call call for a shuttle didn't look broken it's definitely sprained so yeah i think we might be done oh goodness bless it she doesn't want to be done this is her first real kind of injury all right over and out all right she's gonna try it good luck you're welcome i know you all just chilling here with my foot oh it still isn't done hopefully it gets better soon but probably not it really hurts but we don't really have anybody to call because we don't have service so we're right here at island gap next to this road we might honestly just hitchhike home but who knows i'm talking to the camera i'm vlogging baby you almost done are you talking to yourself [Music] oh there she goes a oh did it break did it break duct tape it or something oh it did break really i saw the water just splat out okay well it got something i could hear the water bottles pushing back and forth oh well all right so this this was our campsite this is day three that was our campsite last night that we did not stay at yeah yeah because the road is right there and creepazoid dude in a red truck went this way over there and then backed up a little bit get out of his truck stood at the back and stared at us too long he finally we went behind these bushes here kind of watched him and he drove away and we never packed up camp so fast before in our lives and we packed it up and he hightailed it across the street to another campsite yeah a campsite that was behind the well not even a campsite but we were like uh clearing just a cleaner enough for us to put our tent yeah we were in the cover of the rhododendron trees and creepazoid didn't find us and uh yeah so sarah's ankle's doing a little bit better today we're gonna hike up to where we have cell service you try to call somebody to come get us yeah because if we don't then it'll be like 12 miles today nine miles tomorrow and we just don't know how that ankle is gonna happen it's gonna work out all right so but we had to come back here because i love my crossbot right oh yeah she left her pot and then we didn't realize we also left our sponge my sponge i like my sponge because i like to dry things off with it sometimes all right pineapple shortcake over and out for a while bye-bye adapting so we just stopped for [Music] lunch at little laurel shelter you can't see those fall colors darn it so pretty you can over here and we had cell service yay

pineapple is a good source of vitamin A and we and fairly rich in vitamin C and minerals like calcium magnesium potassium and iron [Music] total annual world production is estimated at fourteen point six million tons of fruits India is the fifth largest producer of pineapple with an annual output of about 1.2 billion tonnes suitable soil for plane a pole crop pineapple grows in almost any type of soil divided it is free training slightly acidic soil with a pH range of 5.5 to 6.0 is considered optimum for pineapple cultivation [Music] the soil must be well-drained in light in texture heavy clay soil is not preferred it can grow in sandy alluvial or laterite soil best season for pineapple plantation pineapple is a humid tropical plant it grows well both in the plains and also in elevations not exceeding 900 meters it tolerates neither very high temperature nor frost pineapple usually flowers from February to April and the fruits are ready from July to September sometimes offseason flowers appear and they produce fruit in September to December [Music] pineapple is usually propagated by sucker slip and crown these planting materials of five to six months age bear flowers after 12 months of planting accept crowns which bear flowers after 19 to 20 months pineapple plants produced through tissue culture are also available for cultivation berthing up as an essential operation in pineapple cultivation aimed at good Anchorage to plants it involves pushing the soil into the trench from the ridge where trench planting is a common practice as the pineapple roots are very shallow the plants are eventually lodged especially under conditions of flat bed planting in heavy rainfall areas [Music] pineapple is mostly cultivated under rain-fed conditions supplementary irrigation helps to produce good sized fruits in areas having optimum rainfall irrigation also helps to establish an offseason planting to maintain into year-round production in case of scanty rainfall and hot weather irrigation may be provided once in 20 to 25 days [Music] pineapple is usually free from pests except for infestation of pili bugs and scale insects and sporadic cases diseases are not common except stem rot in case of pineapple control measures include good drainage and dipping the suckers and Bordeaux mixture before planting [Music] pineapple plants flower 12 to 15 months after planting in the fruits become ready 15 to 18 months after planting depending upon the variety time of planting type and size of plant material used in prevailing temperature during the fruit development under natural conditions pineapple comes to harvest during May August [Music] the fruit usually ripens about five months after flowering the fruits are harvested for candy purpose when there is a slight change at the base of developing fruits the fruits used for table purpose are retained until they develop a golden yellow color [Music] the plant crop after harvest can be retained as ratoon crop for three to four years depending upon the soil condition the average yield is 50 to 80 tons per hectare depending upon spacing and cultural practices in addition to being eaten fresh the fruit can also be canned and processed in different forms abl supplies complete production lines with the objective and attention to the maintenance of these qualities [Music] the degree of rightness freshness and cleanliness of the raw material are very important factors in obtaining high quality products equally important is also the production cycle to which the fruit is subjected so as not to lose the

510 oil cartridges with vape and batteries this episode is brought to you by New York vape shop you can find all the devices that were using in the demonstration today at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with the code rough 3 first we're going to take it look at the anatomy of a 5-10 cartridge first I want to talk about the tip and the tips are pretty much a up to you like however you decide which is your preference is they come in all types of metal they're come in ceramic and they come in wood so the tips are pretty much straightforward next we're going to talk about the tanks the tanks themselves are what holds the oil and they're usually half a milliliter to one milliliter and sometimes the really big ones like the two gram or 2.2 gram heavy hitter cartridges can be really long but referring to the tank is the actual part of the cartridge where the oil is inside of it the two part and then there's the oil inlet and sometimes they come in various whole sizes you can see the one at the top there has a little bit larger hole size than the cartridge there at the bottom and generally for the thicker THC oils you probably want more of a thicker hole then there's the airflow if you can see at the very very bottom this is a bottom airflow and you can see that the airflow hole is right there in the threads at the bottom of the device other devices sometimes have them at the top near the tip and so generally one is either a bottom airflow in most cases sometimes a top airflow and then there's also what they call a variable airflow and you say the case here the airflow is adjustable at the top there so that's the one one thing to consider as well as part of your cartridge and the last and perhaps the most crucial part that we're going to talk about there's here at the base and that is the atomizer and the atomizers are usually either wick or ceramic and the wick they're okay but preferably you probably want to use ceramic today's you get a lot better even distribution better flavor and you see the ceramic heats the oil as it passes through now let's talk about best practices one of the most important things when it comes to using your 510 cartridges with a pin is to use the right voltage setting and you can see generally if it's a variable voltage for these kinds of pins that will vary somewhere between three and five volts and that's the appropriate range for most 510 cartridges but if you're using something like a box mod like the steam cloud that you see here that goes up to sixty watts it's going to be way too much so you're going to want to bring that down to like five watts or to the lower settings and to make sure that you're using the proper voltage or wattage another thing that you want to make sure is that using the proper airflow type you can see this is a bottom airflow device but used on this box mod if you pull it all the way in there there's no air inlet and so for this is the type that you'll need a top airflow so there are types of devices that may not be compatible with certain types of cartridges so that is one thing you want to make sure that for instance of this case you'd want to use a top airflow device and a variable and would be even better and you can see here - this is a bottom airflow and on the bottom airflow there will be a little bitty notch where the air would be allowed to flow through at the bottom of the device so you just want to make sure that you're using the right kind with the right type of device another thing is that when it comes to your empty device you probably just want to throw it and not throw it away but you want to refill it and not just keep hitting it because you're going to burn it out so when you get done with it either go ahead and toss it it's done or stop hitting it until you're ready to refill it or you're going to burn it out another thing is when you're putting in your pocket you really want to be careful with the tips especially with the ones that have an exposed tip and rather than sitting down into a sleeve because if you leave it in your pocket you can do something like this a lot of times it'll bend the tip over one way or the other can expose the electronics and cause you some problems so if you're going to be putting it in your pocket you might want to go with a device such as this where the cartridge sits down inside of it like a sleeve and the last tip we're going to go with here is to make sure that you keep your battery charged or keep a backup battery so if you have a nice pin that you like to use you might want to keep a little cheap on the side that you can have always kind of have as a backup by your charge in the other and that pretty much brings me to the end of my tips and best practices on

are more or less the same strength but since we're doing the top 30 like half what the people in my list I say are tied but since we're doing the top 30 strongest not the top 30 strongest along with ties so I ordered some guys just randomly without actually having anything since I think they're tied but ties are allowed so the only reason I did my tie was just because it's like they're the main characters yeah I was like my one exception Sabo what is your twenty nine me too on the lowest key I think Magellan with delphine cracker just saying a little disgusting but I feel it kind yeah a

name Kurosaki's and sake but man he let her slap him mm-hmm let's not like it you got a hand here Lou yeah I even get some from slap don't like crash but uh before I see money yes it just saying that my 29th movie was swapped out for Hugh tomorrow and she's off the list completely okay 28 is Jack bedroom predict refix mister lack are my boys e what's going on with it this 28 my Kanye is docu o ex strong motor what was yours lack yeah my 29 was lack mi-28 is gonna be an L okay really the Thunder God himself yeah Jack has a pretty good fruit and like skillset but if an L was introduced in a new world he easily be a super strong second commander or first commander and somewhat an inlet Akali curry uncle crew or something like this those overconfident low gears which he infinitely but I feel like he was in a new world instead of back in you know before even paradise he would have you know had a humbling experience to to you know getting smacked up by how to curries future side yeah I mean we haven't we haven't seen him get like load if yet like Luffy was putting his all into it if someone nam because of now if you if he wasn't so arrogant he would have just covered Luffy in that goal completely in suffocating in the death so it was like he could have killed him don't sleep on I know cuz don't remember he can basically make some Goku's that you out of lightning just because of his overconfidence he's gonna like get bested just that's what I'm saying like you would do that in a new world get low dipped and then he would change his personality as all I'm saying like I agree what you're saying I'm just saying after that he would not be he as in Elish you know what I'm saying mmm-hmm yeah like so who are still 27 for Sabo what's going on basically guys I'm gonna tell you right now everything from 2027 and up is all jumbled up because you guys got a bunch of characters I forgot so ya may use X plea well I was gonna happen to me by just one online look of every strong character I could and just  looking there God leave my hello people like when I first made the list it was ridiculous so who's your 27 my yeah okay yeah about 27 is Edward evil you know I'm gonna be was a character have every right to and he was in what three or four panels yes pedestal is that you know he's track he's trying to kill all the white blue parts he the fact that he's confident I don't think he's like a strongest Marco chosen but like he's confident enough but he's able to Kim know guys like jozu guys like Marco guys like Lisa so like just with just the fact that he's that confident in this and his abilities tells me that he's really strong so right now I'm putting them at 27 and also since he was said to be as strong as young white beard and I know this is young white beard but young white beard still gonna be pretty strong right yeah I definitely believe that one we but at the same time I don't think he all right so y'all remember at the beginning the marine for when like white beard stepped up on the scene clean his and it's made a whirlwind just by slashing his by sent oh do you think weevils on that level because I think white beard did that without the devil truth like he did based form that is because like we've seen hockey like Luffy he's rubber but he's using them lightning in half stocky both he and category use fire enhanced hockey can we well yeah but what cows he's rubber how is he gonna be using a lightning attack command yeah but you can't say his lightning hockey because you can speculate he's like a hockey because Murray also had playing monkey and they only end we've got Red Hawk and they only use those attacks when they have hockey on their hands I mean almost everyone can do fighter attacks and one piece fire attacks is nothing special may not be so Sanji did it pre Township so was that hockey and big mom did it when she was rampaging against Scott Scott you just punch in the ground on the lighting email yeah oh oh oh oh thank you for that that that just adds more used to my theory about elemental forms okay that's cool me mad that definitely think big mom got something else going on besides just you know her fruit and regular hockey cuz daunting any of her other hockey's a regular the only thing I can say is her observation haki didn't like jump out at me like every other thing she did that's like the only thing she's here because if when he said that we would have just the whole rest of the combo would have been dead Thanks alright uh who is next Izzy boy with 2727 yeah so John Wolfe who Oh San Juan okay sir John I was like who's John Wolfe Sam come on you gotta give Sam one respect because he's one of the Charles Giants in history but San Juan he got a dumb fruit that kid it was shoot them up to 580 meters you gotta respect that right yeah I mean at the same time there's like been proof that Giants don't do well in battles with top tiers they might like chopped up pretty much Giants ain't never use talking right there to tries to disrespect all the keeps on telling us about these races that are strong right so the diet they're never wrong like what the fishermen are always to become stronger than normal human but the fishermen like our line was cool but like man like this like that I feel like that document guy he was thought Don Kraig's crew could have been given our long and run for his money like our long was weak like really weak it was cool but he was weak yeah he didn't know hockey I don't think he really used fish man karate which was like her could be in the fish man so it was like he kind of squandered his fish man Mnet's is he just had a cool story that he didn't even hockey up so it broke and so my 27 70s missed a boa and ikkaku because she be people with it I know that's and she got Congress hockey and cuz like even John to jail with his Congress hockey prime to jail made GARP struggle I feel like not for long but he did I feel like Garth would do the same thing to do flamingo it's like chin chow I feel like privacy job was like more or less strong as doflamingo but or Jim Bay or something like that maybe we didn't do Flamengo but strongest eBay but for all practical purposes the weakest person we've seen with concur sake is defeat and we all know how strong they fear so you guys with khakhras hockey yo flame yeah you ain't saying much as Eva and in these pics it's like I'm trying to figure out I was trying to figure out some some stuff with this recording software but yeah I'm good number hey let's let's just attempt to get to 15 yeah what's 26 for Sabo hmm yeah factor peckerwood okey I agree bacala dad oh oh no bro come on like cracker was good yes but that utility of dough fee crazy I don't think record was awakened utility only take you so far no but there was a theory he's not a waiter oh wait there was this theory though yeah hating the biscuits from the ground because if you look at the manga panels it actually does Loki look like the cracker on parts are like they're coming from the ground and he's forming them into crackers so some people are making an argument cracker was awakened because he was taking the crackers out of the ground I had cracker basically I have cracker hand I have cracker doflamingo Bowa Hancock and Catarina d-von all at number 30 but since we can't do ties really I only have one tie cuz I really couldn't decide there but since I have I don't want to have a five-way tie at number 30 I just put the mussels honorable mentions it's pretty hard but at the same time I don't know about half those people being at 30 but to each his own Yvonne is 30 because her doll fruit because of her double fruits potential it's got the potential to basically manipulate every single element we've learned of and to be able to create literally illusions so perfect but you can live in the illusion world forever why relies you're there so basically her devil fruit as a kitsune devil fruit and all the things I've listed it's a mythical xoan and all the abilities I've just listed are the potential abilities of the Ksenia she's would be you would be able to shadow jump she would be able to me as I said allegiance so I only put out thirty because of the potential her the duffel troop has not because of any facts you know other gnomes they usually only have like one special power right but instance and since ad Yvonne did that shape-shifting thing I'm thinking that wasn't shape-shifting it was her illusion ability so I think she's gonna fight mostly with illusions and that actually worked perfectly with Nami because we know Nami likes to use illusions as well cool so so that I feel like when they fight the black pirates Devon and army are gonna be having an illusion battle so at that point it won't even be necessarily Nami has to be stronger than Devon she just has to I mean well I mean I mean Lee but Nami has Zeus if she out illusions Devon and hits her with Zeus late twice the most factional tough dirty dough is mine though the guys and crew 26 now yeah mu which is 26 bro 526 is the good ol lucky really mr. fat meat hey let's go let me room in blue what wait what was it to 2016 oh no wait don't okay I'll put dinner on that fast my 26 in a a little low it's what y'all need to know though these people on top very loud and be kind of close together you know no one is top dirty is like I'm saying that they're super weak compared to this person you know it could literally be like when it could be like 2% last week or something you know and it's funny because I actually have smoothie next mats that's awesome I feel like I have to put her in because she's a second commander and is like you respect the rank but at the same time she's gonna be under some people that kind of don't make sense only because she's like counted that trash right now so for me my 26 and smoothie let me repeat this smoothie a second division commander is crying out somebody do something by the way some of the guys guys some of the guys I have a Skype I just imagine them but just saying I think something's like as strong as yak you think big mom say commander is as strong as Kai toaster commander no no no I say that is because like what it seems to be vulture is the more commander's you have the more like their weaknesses spaced out so like the black be upon our black cream the wipe your privates like ease oh he's not gonna be fighting a guy like King right but I fit since the Beast put like the last command the strength is so the Beast pirates their command like their third commander is going to be stronger than big mom pirates earth man because they have less commanders see what I'm trying to say I mean to be honest bro smoothie should be top five you know I'm saying top 5 best people in it I mean because she cost moody for a reason you know she's gonna slip that bad boy up she's up there a raid you sure I'm sure I forgot to spill that I'm taking yeah so shoot amaru over cracker that's interesting why okay so you think because he beat Jack or or the TV slash neck you'll be able to be cracker yeah you guys forget this jack mat-su tomorrow he matched in a rocky nekima luffy tank the elephant hit always oh oh oh he's hybrid form which is the strongest form so far I wasn't stained blue I wasn't saying shoot tomorrow beat Jack I'm just saying I'm thinking of what Szabo's thinking I'm trying to see where he's getting logic pump and I don't think I don't worry dude all right my list isn't over all right sorry wrong person I got the mix of sorry I have you kuma without this brain right now well kuma with his brains I forgot his bean until he said that quick question do you all think that he can use hockey since he doesn't have his brain no idea I forgot he lost his brain well not my whole listen they say you say kuma cuz he has no what waited brain just like come Oh what what's his brain but since we can't think that was brain just like my 25 is Orochi Oh bro she hey now it's just voter right yay well true oh my god yeah I got my gym I think a defeat what well hey oh no I always do that bro that's when your father is Magellan okay hey I can't respect to that even though I'm I did not hear that cheer emojis fell asleep I bet when it comes back he's gonna be so mad he missed it and I think I do think that he um yo yes me straight nice up and being here I don't know where he is I mean they come drew I couldn't I couldn't fill it they loose real quick they just got here quick and then I want to like argue with them huh it was on Orochi my jealous yay please I don't [Music] wanna have a tit man Brad I'm either pause this recording see if I could pause this um what's your 20 force over shabu shabu shabu shabu I didn't know I didn't know if y'all could give me you know so Lucy Peck oh that is interesting is she I'm not gonna lie to you I'm trying to see where this is going I'm excited blue yeah I just done some sob up looking at your list for too long pineapple I know you want to go in but we could talk about bullying in but you got boa over a row Chi just fine that just real quick that's easy what who me yeah the bowl what the floater oh gee well right now I think in the end or else you'd be stronger I just want to see more from him so like I'm good I'm granting him like a number 30 spot but I thought you should even be like I both the people I've even listed right now but I just know where to put them exactly so I just put them at number 34 now I kind of agree that's kind of why I did - yeah I would hope he's strong older yeah at least because like you give this guy a mythical zone that were ferreira them logia like he has to have some sort of high competence yeah so a blue what sugar 24 oh that hurt hello 24 words and I came here with Queens the Queen what which is 24 Zboard my plan for her I got back on my list my 24 is King their king their queen great oh my my 24:4 is cracker I'll ring it up we moved on to 23's or what yeah I'm 23 Babu you I see he knew and you got hired right for them bro there will be no fee what's going on yeah so so did you put them over each other just because you didn't want to put them in the same spot yeah I think they're equal in strength yeah meet me too I figured blue 23 Mach 23 is good old saddle what I would have liked it to be a little higher but I 23 just like Saitama said 20 words a list when t 3 to 17 I said I have note that said Oh first mates are more or less equal I'm just ordering them because I have to but isn't really a first mate this guy's this guy's transmits outside we basically first makes the revolutionaries yeah but then you would have to say that dragon is equal to like the power Bianco and it's snow down here okay I'll pretend I didn't hear that but then you have to say me back all the other commanders he's got a army as strong as Yahoo problem stronger than the Aqua crews more members although so who is the second and third in command that is matching a yonkos level because I see Sabo fighting the first commander but I don't see I feel like Kara Sabine commander dude yeah and then like morally and Lindbergh bellow Betty like those are like morally he looks wrong since he's like the only low he's the only Giants even hinted to be strong with the devil fruit in hockey and stuff so and then like mmm Lindbergh he's like a crazy event there apparently it's like he's kind of like invent he's kind of an inventor like what we kind of expected them Beckman to be so like all of them are gonna be pretty strong because these guys remember they're fighting the world government are different fronts their commanders fighting the world government on different fronts that means the world government's gonna send their like vice-admiral candidates to become Admirals at them and they're still around like they're strong they're strong but I don't know they're as strong as you're giving them credit to be but we only twenty where's lists so z-boy what is your touch oh my 23 9 23 I keep accidentally going out the screen I'm trying to look up who these characters are yeah I've got he looks pretty high on katarina debug the looking I mean sometimes I think to myself like what am i doing what am I saying yeah feel it katarina Dave on 23 I got along what wait hold on hold on spectrum engine do you have a powdery - Dave on over kaido's first commander you can't talk about anybody bro you got lava crackers over my jelly magellan oh thank you take las frutas break easy if you don't know what he does Nilo gives you what do you mean have what does cracker doing to a melon nothing well why is cracker on Magellan you have milk he has multiple cracker Magellan's if he can poison loki is if you don't know hockey Magellan like washing crack cracker knows hockey and he can create multiple biscuit soldiers but like prick like pretty much have all of his uh like Magellan's poison not do anything to him because poison effects like the the nervous system and all these other stuffs cracker quarters don't have that so you spewing all your poison a time they just walking through that I can't because Magellan isn't fast and he cracker has low durability but Magellan doesn't have the highest either because he challenged awakened in May I mean it is too slow and hockey could probably do some to food if you like fast and have hockey with a good fruit you can definitely overcome a jello yeah let's go Bobbo Wester 22 okay black I'm making sure like I'm literally if y'all see it when I put a family despite their lack blue Phoenix with is your 20 to show you love really feel it the boy what's it the Phoenix you wallet oh man lots of respect here not get a lot of here they do of Zeebo boy 22 I don't know how to say this name easily but basically his name kind of sounds similar DeLuca L a FF I'll be here the demon sheriff don't like it he looked supposed to be a French dude he's the fee thing I think really is the feet maybe so so so Z boy are you still going with all these dudes on Blackbeard's crew over King just making sure yeah man all right when I had created his list Blackbeard had just show up again and had low dip Moria so that's probably what happened so what I'm saying is you didn't even bother to redo your list for this week it wasn't long ago man not that not that much as I might get a lot of a lot heat this one but i'ma put Coomer at number 21 wait we doing 20 months actually no I'm switching it I'm switching it hold on I got we still is on 22 my bad I was looking ahead sorry um I'm switching long Coomer I put law of Okuma still his cracker kuma and in law okay you better say all this stuff and then you're gonna go up to me you're gonna say that same prime Lauria it's a strong at least the drunks doflamingo is crazy then you're gonna put law over Zorro and like over cracker well Lock and Load if crackers ability because all cracker all he does is make it hard for you deal with multiple enemies law literally has a room where he's God and he can do as many people as he wants and he can probably it's not kinda fine him in his own me the guy who gave him this fruit and trainer since he was a kid I understand why he lost if you can't I don't tell you if he face anyone else that don't know what he can do in detail like like don't worry crazy you see like plot armor you got because we think about it so for like okay someone like fujitora couldn't break doflamingo birdcage strings doflamingo had some like minor plot armor there himself so it was like he's crazy to begin with like that fight was crazy I wouldn't put someone like old cracker would do so much better against law then like anyone else like law could be cracker I really don't see how you can't see it well well don't be different though because like his bird cage is unbreakable but if fujitora morning he could just attack doflamingo instead of trying to get out of the birdcage he destroyed well it hasn't been said that his bird cage indestructible like I don't think there's anything is indestructible besides probably Bartolomeo cage I mean his his his shield thing because that's like the purpose of it but uh that's just I don't know man I just think law does that do his fruit is crazy he like number one I can respect it 21 for subbu oh what's your 20 - what are you cleaning - vulture about 22 is lost kuma so I just switched long kuma so is coma for Clinton coma is 23 loss 22 okay thank you cuz I was like my bet 21 Phoenix would it is my 21 my 21 is I know I said no god this is my only time cuz I really could not use the because all these guys are like suppose 100 people in the tie was like three or four people we're just well in this two are twenty twenty one is just two and that would be the goofy and K Oh dad that's interesting tell you I'll see you later I I can definitely see how you think they're tired I'm cool with it 21:01 luffy and kid wait wait we can yeah I have I had one cut cop with Zorro Sanji because they're neck-and-neck if not you can see that Otis kind of making Luffy and Kidd parallels right now so like and I an asteroid og and now it's reducing but the cat the big cat and dog you could put you could you you probably could like split them up to and one because they're basically the same person so 21 for Z boy what's going on go drag the drag queen himself man Oh  uh I forgot his name a conundrum his name Ivanka von Cobb at number 20 I don't know what the is happening in the history over Queen over but like he's the commander level like I feel like he's not a commander necessarily in the Revolutionary Army I feel like I feel like you know I know he's a commander but if you could wind up a headliner in the Beast pirates like the committee level no no I'm saying like like you could put it below coming into Louisville I know what you're saying like you're putting him like the hell out is a right below the commander's game he was barely beating like he was fighting neck-and-neck with robot kuma who wasn't in control of himself and couldn't use his full powers anymore no no he wasn't completely turned into a robot at Marina for was he no he wasn't so he didn't have the Popoff for anymore when he's a robot but it's just like the Papa fruit it's like as controlled as his lasers so he who am i a marine for was weaker than cool man through the bark okay I can see he lost his mind at that point he lost the capability of hockey and knowledge okay cool yes but I don't that that whole of on Hoffa will defeat and half the universe I don't know about it but over king-queen Orochi bro yeah man can you get behind that Sabu if you can and you know what I may just be tripping people are gonna say that King beat the whole big Hong crew he snuck up on them and ambushed them but just the fact that he was able to conceal them stuff from very undoubtedly observation haki that well you gotta respect that Lily you have to respect that if I'm carve isn't gonna be doing that if he tried to like do you a death wink them off the waterfall he would have gotten like he could do I'm saying that you know they started coming oh my god what happened that people are saying that King went and he just came from afar what happened was they would go weekly work on the waterfalls if they were in the most vulnerable position where they're like at a almost like a 75 degree angle or something and then king but burst out and he came at them and he shoved them off and he flew away so basically they had enough time to see him but not react yeah 21 although we all break in that let's be honest oh no I was saying my 21 is doflamingo oops he has like a couple asked about being the main one is like he doesn't actually laugh he just like under his breath just I think he's really like laughing at you like you ain't then he actually laugh that's when you know you up it's all bad sob oh what's that 20 looking like pots of curry and Ozzy boy 2020 is Marco muscle so you put mark with 30 move everyone down yeah you know one replace them okay so just leave a roach it there you for now or what yeah okay cool my 20 is nice look is it so do ya there is Queen 420 what is your it was you're a nineteen so if you confuse me is it making it funny oh we're happy money my twenty is Queen and we're going on a 90 now what's all those who blue katakuri they both had caught a curio 20 yeah Sabah was in nineteen so what you got nineteen so and wait wait hold on wait wait I got a pause every everything in the vicinity key Oshiro is over katakuri yeah like recording Wow broke it alright I know we're trying to do this fast but I really got to hear why Kyosho Rose beating future Simon credit lists the big mob because it was introduced later that come on common sense you obviously not stronger than like a young black come on yeah like as the Shonan reason I really have to like no because I don't understand it's different it's like kill show he's strong he's gonna be really strong but it's it's not like he's I feel like he's gonna be one of Zorro's power-ups but not zones final opponent he's strong but I don't think he's gonna be taking out the Onkel commanders is that to a hot key like what so he's he's over first commander or the yes like I feel like and because that means Zerona luffy would have to be around the same strength like type levels no we we did this whole this was like where they are l because if him no but he's not sort of final opponent I think he's gonna be absorbed stepping-stone how do you know that we don't know I don't know that he's not presented as a final boss like the guys presented as possible final bosses for Zorro are like kyoshiro he's not even portrayed to be stronger than the commander's Kyosho remember he went and asked Queen discern and assassins he was commander of his own guys right but he's going around asking for things I got 18 so we're not really I'm on it my name's kid wait wait wait wait I'm crazy for having these that nineteen but you got kid immediately supernova nineteen the queen of dopey kids are ugly so we know female here's the problem bro here's the problem Magellan is solo this man this dude in jail and disrespect is wild man 20 where's all I'm saying yes he hasn't been shown hockey yet that's all I'm saying so he bumped down a lot just said yeah he found it yeah this restraining comes right now the stream Immokalee know my pain was factual blue Saba Wilshire 18 King my team is King as well boy my team is category I can respect that but I still can't respect you got has emerged just over King but me I died Barry Hey number 17 Sabo yeah which is wait wait wait Luffy oh oh Luffy nah my mother's ever again Lucia z-boy 20 words or less fam when we feel our rage at somebody else's while well up just try to digress and push it down and save it for a heated discussion on discord I just don't know why you couldn't Luffy down like that like when he got mad plumber and - he's a suit of armor - you know he's just like his poor armor his healing somebody figured out I don't know how I didn't before but his his same healing it's probably just this rubber body stretching to UM cover stuff up and heal okay I see boy go off on him come on you went off on me cuz kid was there 19 I'm just I'm just hydro I'm just like it's not mad it's just one piece I'm not no no I didn't say man I was saying like let him know why kids should be over King but I guess you don't agree with it but I think it is over King I just I don't agree but I'm there you go people think kid is like God above kata Korea he's above kata curity right now the both 400 and kata curatu I see I say both katakuri you know yeah lufia yeah Luffy Louie yeah I mean exactly he shouldn't be but you just put him there you say he is above first commander level and you know he really didn't win that fight straight out so you got help from barn you was still stronger than no flamingos at the end no doubt about it it's all the hope you got he doesn't though if you would have died if they were in a room and your four friends because a nice story is written he is ya know this is the top 30 with list not who was doing what overall from what we've seen yeah Mar 17 is Merkel the Phoenix Park lead boy which is 17 I keep in my bed I'm Saba Sabo but I can respect that talk to my boys are okay wait our YouTube channel was thank you Sabo I said my seventeen with Marco me invoker both got Sabu okay what's their 16th number yeah he said what's your sixteen moat well I can see why you say that if if she's post times defeats were cannon but they're not so on the lowest Kiki whoa where I'm ticklish Hey for my 26 I'm taking off smooth bro come on man we can't do this you know what and you're not 15 and we're on sixteen right now so oh oh so it's gonna be a part two it is yeah not tomorrow but it'll be soon yes right soon for the people wise and their energy up any other people might watching the stream make sure you leave a like make sure you subscribe you know there's gonna be a part two we're gonna stop at 15 so make sure to strive everybody here give me a whole chain wait can I say my number 60 yeah go ahead bro my number 16 is or okay my number is a roach chief and I think he's Admiral level I think he's about Australia's food tour because there's difference between Admirals like marine for exact Azuki and then admirals like fujitora right now all Admirals are equal so that's right we're specifically saying I think he's like more or less strongest fujitora because as I said Luffy is gonna be stronger not stronger he's gonna be younger level at the end before I know in my opinion as always he's gonna be on a different level than other first commanders since he's gonna be he's gonna be the sword God or the greatest swordsman in the world or something so I feel like he's gonna like progress faster so I think he gonna be I think he's gonna be as strong as from unit aura like that kind of emerald the weaker side of armor level at the end of 100 so z-boy will know north gonna like have to fight a bunch of smaller guys I don't no even what you said before might be right like if kyoshiro is like a strong sk curry if he beats hero like he beat somebody look it's weaker than beats kyoshiro and then after that he puts his all on the line to beats Orochi something like that z-boys for the love of God what is your sixteen the gravity master himself hey I'll a part of that in our private voucher nice well of Sabo for six people at Marco here yeah my my my Oh 6215 sabha music scene Sabu no you know you forgot Sabbath and I said Marku okay so 1500 man bro yo I hope for Lucci dang you're not using the movie man what's your 15 my 15 is the man the myth the legend and the blind legend the blind man and the blind to miss fujitora Z boy what is your 15 15 is a Vista hey wow we're sorry my 15 I got King the king I get that but so we end in the stream now and doing a part to relax how we are not right now or you go right no no I'm saying are we are we not because I said if notice a voter said we might but if we don't if we don't I'm gonna have to dip it like number 13 or something okay I mean we could do a part to do y'all want wanna like but not even this weekend like Mabley to do it okay and then you just sit in one of our st hild ass in it and with your Finnish knob and man would I think Butler you and I can just get so we can just get it hello this man right here me oh my bag so kick my Barrett I was just paying in that weekend leader I mean he like all the lists breaking up blue Sint when his listings finished it up I'm okay well by now okay well guys I guess well I guess that's a good sound that we probably have a part to make sure you go sub the Szabo make sure you go to blue pineapple and vulture I promised his mic isn't not always like this usually he has like cuz I looked at his stream it's pretty great you know he has like a like a good background good music in the back and I like the way set up Sabo got some good stuff too powerful got some good ideas I gotta check out some more solid

of course it's different doing it on live stream you know this is a program we usually do for you in person as a theatrical presentation so there might be a little of a couple of lichens here and there with the tech can I apologize we're getting better all the time but that's what tech does but but it's um it's it's always different our programs are always different because with Christa I have so much video I have so much information because she did so many interviews herself but with like Deborah Sampson who was the first woman to fight in the American military disguised as a man and during the Revolutionary War I don't have videos so I have to go back even further to primary sources like journals war records official documents like government documents that showed that she hadn't served in the Army so on and so forth so it's like playing Sherlock Holmes every time you write one of these programs because it just depends on what woman were selecting to write about so somebody asked a question that I said I would get back to later on and now I can't remember what that question was so raise your hand again I'm gonna get everyone choose someone I haven't chosen yet and then we'll get back to that question the other question so my gear you're unmuted actually happens Challenger shuttle so if you want to see the family requested that I not show in the performance the actual explosion and I thought that was a very reasonable request and the family has her sister is seen as her best friend to see that their daughter has seen it and they approve that you know there's no explosion so let's talk a little bit about let's talk a little bit about what happened on the actual so this is the chat this is actually a model of a challenger show it's 144th of the size so 44 times bigger than this is the actual shuttle and or 100 and 144 so if the shuttle is on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral these yellow fuel tank that attach to it and then there's this great big public

a liquids that they've found and I want to go ahead and challenge another YouTube channel I challenge you suck my mod Matt and V you guys are so happy all the time you guys are always having jokes and laughs and always looking so happy and attractive well you know what I'm gonna get in your life I wanna get in your world I'm gonna get inside your mouth we're gonna go ahead and send you grocery liquids and you're gonna vape really horrible flavors we challenge you this is the gross eliquid challenge I can't wait to see it yeah the guys over example box were so so kind to call us out about this and then send us these delicious eliquids oh yeah then we got to get them back somehow yeah so they sent us three liquids that we're gonna try now again please don't liken this to like vaping Tide Pods or something there's nothing dangerous about these liquids it is made like normal a liquid is made they've just made with gross flavors I remember before we even started the channel like Phil Bastardo made a few videos on some really gross a liquids so like I don't know if there's actually people out there that vapes likes like pizza flavored liquid and crap like that savory liquids like do any of you actually exist or are these more just like a joke so what we got here is we got blue cheese we got grilled shrimp and pizzeria what do you wanna do first - pizza I'm a big fan of pizza I don't know about vape in it and so I'm we're gonna use the nudge 22 which is probably a bad idea because it has really good flavor but you know if you're single it's single coil and it's like really easy to re wick so that's why I'm doing it because they're gonna re wick before each one of these but I I wish that we would have just used a addi that's really sucks like some sub ohm tank that's not very good and we have a nice diet coke here - a little chaser cleanser pellet you know I bet you these altogether would probably taste better than they will apart yeah well think about blue cheese with shrimp might be boss maybe not the pizza well let's try it at the very end of this we're gonna make all three of them together okay so first off we have pizzeria looks like they put some tape on the label and maybe block out the company's I don't know but whoever makes this thanks a lot [Music] smells it smells like a corn chip snack of something like a cheetah or something I think you should go first on this one one over we do daring stuff like on the other channel team I am always the one that has to do it and you never do anything so I think you go first rain I make sure there's enough liquid on there I want the full effect I want this pizza in my mouth okay we'll put it on up to I'd say about 100 will go 45 watts here you go my dear it tastes like a frito yeah that's what it's smelling not like this one seems like it's probably gonna be the easiest out of all oh the aftertaste is disgusting the aftertaste makes me want a freaking hurl oh it does it tastes like a frito like a chili cheese burrito or something yeah honestly the one that I'm scared the most for is the blue cheese which one you want to do next you want to see the blue cheese for last yeah let's check the I let's do that I really though I want to know if anyone out there actually hates this for enjoyment yeah comment below if these are the type of flavors that you vape on an everyday basis explain why like companies actually make flavors like this and sell them and you would think like if they don't you know you would think they would discontinue it if people don't yeah okay grilled shrimp curry so this grilled shrimp flavor is probably gonna taste like you ever born underwear for like three days straight and then tasted them them either oh you don't remember oh my god let me just get this out of the way real quick I need to turn the what that was too hot there I would say 42 watts is probably perfect oh okay Oh what are you getting like justwe get like fake seafood like this fake think you ever had like a seafood flavoured something tastes like a burnt shrimp oh the aftertaste smells like have some coke here have some Diet Coke I'm just trying to get my nose away from this the blue CH honestly we should have done the blue cheese first yeah because I'm already getting that feeling and I know people are gonna be like calling me out for being a wuss but I understand I've already had a upset stomach today just the worst possible time thankfully I don't puke easily like it takes a lot for me to puke yeah I honestly don't understand why anybody this on a regular basis maybe if you're like on a fasting diet or something and like you just haven't eaten anything for like three days and you want to taste something salty maybe ok blue cheese don't if you puke I'm gonna puke never done one of these words I've always watched other people youtubers do this and then like all those guys are wings oh I got a wiggle rip oh yeah make that or vape that from Linda Oh pew-pew kid where you going honey are you puking we gotta come stop the video stop being so dramatic get down here did you puke it's fine you weenie get over here did you do it no I'm waiting for you to come down you have to sit next to me I can't smell it I can't smell that smell again the vape parts not bad blow it that way please [Laughter] that is disgusting we have a wetter [Music] oh no don't do that there's a garbage can right out of camera here I told you it's the whiff afterwards isn't it oh I could smell it I could smell it it smells like feet okay let's wrap this up sample box never doing that again you will no I will I was horrible I was four I was five okay thanks thanks guys for watching I seriously could not smell that like yeah fill it up with normal vapor oh my

team begins their workday the crew always dresses in protective clothing freshly cleaned work clothes and safety gear are provided by dole each morning and are collected again each evening for washing the protective clothing differs depending on the work for harvesting rugged jeans chaps thick gloves and protective glasses are worn to safeguard against the spiky bromeliad leaves the pineapple fields have been split into blocks the respective blocks are divided among the workers while the harvest is underway the foreman inspects the next blocks to be harvested pineapples are regularly sampled for quality workers check their flesh color and use a refractometer to measure sugar content when the shell takes on a rich golden hue and the flesh is sweet and juicy the pineapples are ready for picking pineapples are harvested at the peak of ripeness and don't ripen any further or get sweeter after picking we use a specialized conveyor called a boob harvester which gradually moves through the field the size of the blocks is designed specifically for our harvesting equipment the pineapples are picked by hand workers carefully place the fruit on the conveyor as pineapples are sensitive to bruising and damage the conveyor carries them to the field bin where they are quickly but gently transferred by hand the crown of a pineapple provides an ideal cushion for transport so the fruits are stored upside down in the bins the harvested fruit is quickly transported to our packing facility the field bins are submerged into a pool of water if any pineapples sink they do not meet our quality standards with the help of a gentle current the floating pineapples are carried to the first workstation at the same time they are washed and cooled a conveyor belt then takes them to the sorting station only pineapples of the correct size and quality are sent on to our packing area pineapples that do not meet our quality specifications for fresh fruit are sold locally for processing as juice or other products the pineapples are then sealed in wax this prevents them from losing moisture content and keeps them fresh during transport upon arriving in the packing area the pineapples are packed in boxes in accordance with their size and color [Music] their respective size is marked on the box once each box is full the dole label is applied the worldwide symbol for quality to keep up with the volume of pineapples harvested up to ten thousand boxes are needed every day and these are all assembled on site the boxed fruit then travels onto the pallet station the pineapples are loaded on pallets according to size pallet corner boards come here from a nearby recycling plant a joint venture between Dole and a local company together with the pallets and boxes all the packaging components needed for shipping are combined on-site making the packing process fast and efficient each pallet is identified with a barcode and boxes are identified with a lot number this enables the pineapples to be tracked back to the farm of origin once they have arrived in the US the pineapples are then chilled by forced air cooling reducing their temperature to an optimum of 45 degrees Fahrenheit this puts them in a state of hibernation which is maintained throughout their trip [Music] soon trucks will bring these containers of fruit to the port of Maui for a quick ocean voyage to the US at each step of the process every pineapple receives special handling and care our team of dedicated professionals ensures that consumers receive the freshest fruit possible every

this this fresh time farmers market concept to the Midwest we were gonna have a distribution center right off of that and we were gonna be popping open stores at an amazing rates and I needed a supplier somewhere locally that can could actually get to those stores and supply all of our needs because we had we weren't self distributed and the Blue Book was a super helpful tool for me to go in find the right place that centrally was centrally located to where our stores were gonna be popping up and I found him I found actually two of them and they were integral to the success of fresh time and we opened this place because we weren't supply itself supply and then we relied on those guys great and the Blue Book I was able to go in there and see okay I can see how large this supplier is what his integrity is and it showed me that it was somebody that I felt could handle our business and that I was proud to say was doing the distribution for our produce we use Blue Book a lot to find not only for commodity items but it also is a great help with packing guidelines there's a lot of information in there for us to use and I've reached out on an issue I was having you know with the supplier and not quite sure on what the pack of guidelines would be on that and they got right back to me to let me know where they thought the pack of guidelines would fall in this instance and it

battery now I know this sounds simple but there is a wrong way to do it so what I'm going to show you is the right way in the wrong way to charge your battery so first thing we're gonna show you a couple wrong ways to charge your battery so what I have here is a buttonless OH to vape battery and a three point seven volt charger what we don't recommend doing is screwing the battery on to the charger first what you can do is you can tighten the battery too tight which in turn pushes the connection plate down and you don't get a good connection with your cartridge therefore making for a bad experience if you get experience at all the other thing that we don't recommend doing is using a fast charger or a rapid charger indicated by the lightening bolt or tablet chargers as these put out too much power and can fry your battery the correct way to charge your battery is to use a laptop or a standard 5 volt black charger that you plug into the wall and what you're going to want to do is you're going to want to plug in your USB charger first green light comes on and then you're simply going to screw the battery on after what this allows you to do is see the light turn red right when you get a connection so as you see it didn't take much to tighten it on there and we can even tighten it a little more but we have a good secure connection we know it's not going to damage the connection plate and we know it's gonna be ready to go when it's finished so thank you guys for choosing o to vape and have a vape filled day", "U4543B_f4KA": "[Music] hi guys this ayah version amun

brand new segment on the channel where we review the best carts around now we normally do we'd review x' and we will have a playlist of that in the description we are also going to make a brand new playlist for these cart reviews so very exciting stuff here our first cart review is none other than blue dreams so very excited Dave what you have to say about Blue Dream Blue Dream is a west coast legend amongst weed it is a crossbreed between blue berry indica and a sativa known as haze and this dream child amongst these two makes it a very potent hybrid and of course when you think about blue dream automatically the flavor comes to mind it's one of the most flavorful strains around so I was really excited to taste this and it really stays true to the bud it's very flavorful the oil has a night nice light golden color to it so very appealing as well now the main difference between the strain and the oil is well the oil is a concentrated version of the weed itself so this oil right here is about 78 percent THC by volume and it has a couple of other good cannabinoids and high amounts in there but then the rest of the oil is known as terpenes and that's the flavor profile but all natural flavors that are in the bud itself now blue dream is known for having a lot of stress relieving properties to it as well as depression fighting and nausea preventing busts so that makes it a very good medicinal weed alright so normally I just cut to the score but Dave I have a two-part question for you today I want to know which one you prefer in terms of the weed strain or the oil strain and also of course the Bama rating me personally Pat I really enjoy the flour from Blue Dream it's been a little bit since I've smoked it however I do remember all those beautiful floral notes especially when you use it so it's one of my favorite strains to smoke as far as my Bimmer rating for this cart I mean we started off with a really really good one so we asked her to make it known that this is a really good kart right off the bat I'm gonna give this one a four out of five okay so there you go a legendary strain translating very well to a legendary oil so that is our first cart

and Moxie here today to show you how to use our vaporizer pen a standard vape pen has two components a battery and an oil cartridge the battery provides energy to heat the oil in the cartridge to turn it into vapor this is the Moxie 510 thread battery it works with our liquid moxie or live resin cartridges as well as any other Universal threat card the battery comes with the USB charger you just insert the battery into the charger like this and charge it in your computer or wall charger it can take up to two hours for initial charge and then you're good to go you take your vape cart and screw it into the battery you click the button five times to turn it on it'll light up and now it's ready to use inhale and enjoy the battery has three voltage settings each voltage setting corresponds to a temperature setting on the atomizer the default setting is 2 point 6 volts which is the coolest setting and shows us green on our pen this heats the oil the least which preserves the most volatile cannabinoids and turbines we recommend using the setting for optimal flavor and efficiency the higher voltage settings deliver more heat to the atomizer some users enjoy that so that they can generate more vapor and blow bigger clouds to change the voltage setting you click the button 3 times from green 3 clicks will take you to the medium setting of blue which is 3.3 volts and another 3 clicks will take you to the red at 4 volts but for us we really like the green setting so we'll always click it back three more times to send it back to green when you're done you just click the button five times to power it off and you'll see the green light go out that's all there is to it if you have any additional questions leave them in the comment section and we'll get back to you thank you very

take the opportunity to apologize I'm sorry sorry that you're so easily triggered you don't have a sense of humor you pricks [Music] hey guys what's going on I hope you're having a fantastic week so far I'm finally feeling better you guys have been asking me repeatedly to do a video on Patti Mayo first and foremost I had to do some research on Patti Mayo a bunch of you guys have recommended me watch his videos I watched a couple episodes it was a while ago now and I just I wasn't interested so in order to do this video I had to watch a couple of his videos but the first and foremost biggest thing I want to tell you guys is doughnut operator did a fantastic 10 minute video and really did his research on Patti Mayo and I'm actually going to put a link to his video in the description so I felt it was appropriate to give him credit and he really went all out to to do his research and find out more about Patti Mayo and he was good about connecting the dots with everything so first and most importantly I have to give Patti Mayo credit he knows how to market his YouTube channel and it has exploded exponentially whatever he's doing is working for him and that is fantastic and from the few episodes that I've seen the camera work is really good the editing is good and overall it seems interesting it's entertaining that's about where my interest stops and I personally don't watch him if you're a teenager and you're like wanting to be a cop and you're older I can see where his videos would be motivational but one thing I want to keep in mind and remind you guys is that what his show depicts is not real law enforcement there's two things that concern me with Patti Mayo number one is of course the fact that Patti Mayo is not a police officer the second thing that concerns me is how he presents itself in front of the public not just the people around him but obviously millions of people on YouTube the way he unprofessionally screams at people that he's supposedly locking up or taking to jail is not something any officer should be doing that breaks just about every moral in our handbook in real life if I was to start screaming at people through the back of my window and calling them [ __ ] I would probably have a write up waiting for me I think we call that conduct unbecoming of an officer and I'll be the first to admit guys I there have been times where I have lost my cool I have called people dumbass I've called people other names and frustration but I don't stand there in front of a camera crew or a group of people and scream at somebody through the back of my window either even without the camera crew and the group of people I don't scream at people in my car but the few times I've done it there's a I'm in a place for that and it's not when somebody's handcuffed in the back of your car another thing I want to point out and the fact that I just made that statement might seem hypocritical because I have very crude humor on my channel I get that of all the cop channels on YouTube by far mine and probably doughnut operators are the least politically correct so sometimes that can be misconstrued as unprofessional but my channel is here for education and entertainment part of entertainment is connecting with your audience connecting with your audience sometimes means crude humor but I am NOT claiming to be anything I'm not I really am a police officer I have a work history to prove it and I have my law enforcement certification to back it up again my channel is for education and entertainment to be intertwined together but the crude humor that I use on this channel is not something I would say while I'm in uniform on duty I do think that paddy Mayo's videos have the potential to be very entertaining to people that aren't necessarily really familiar with law enforcement or how it all works I think the situations that he gets into our way overdramatized but that's perfect for video it's perfect but as a police officer with over a decade of experience watching patty mayo he seems more like an unprofessional cowboy than he does a law enforcement officer patty Mayo would be the type of officer on your shift that nobody wants to associate with because you don't want to end up in federal court when he eventually goes there because officers like him do end up in federal court eventually for violating somebody's rights and every department has that cowboy that wants to get into everything they can and then they usually expect other people and their shift to help them out with that extra work they created which means more paperwork but to me patty Mayo is a prime example of that just overly eager cop that rookie cop that rides that fine line on whether or not he actually has probable cause you know on the other hand petty ma'am and I do have something in common when I was young and before I was a cop I also had police lights on my car illegally but the biggest thing I want you guys to take from this video is the fact that petty mayose channel is for entertainment purposes okay it's not a documentary that nothing about it he never claims anything is factual and donut actually went to the extent of looking into this and there's like some casting website where you can sign up to be on his show or something I don't want to misquote donut he did a really good video and again I don't really want you guys to check it out if you're enos either you already have seen his video or you will enjoy his video but Patti Mayo makes money to film things like I do YouTube is no different than say TV stations when it comes to ratings you get paid based on views and advertisements so me personally I have no doubt that the majority of his show if not all of it it's probably scripted it's probably scripted very well rehearsed and there's probably a lot of waivers signed considering how much physical activity is on the show so if anybody gets hurt nobody consume and I say probably because I'm not there to watch the filming so I can't say without a shadow of a doubt the other problem I had when it comes to Patti Mayo he is very much one of those stereotypical tacticool guys what I mean by that is him and the other people on his show that are on his team they are always dressed out in the most perfect tactical gear never any dirt never any scratches or scruffs on his gear and it's way overdone but the worst part is they don't know how to use their gear the last episode I watched his partner in the passenger seat was literally with one hand pointing his Glock out the driver's side window near Patti's face let me catch an officer pointing his service weapon three inches from my face and we'll see what happens between sweeping his partner with his gun and awkwardly holding it in one hand when he's not even pointing at the target it's obvious it's very obvious that these guys have no formal training and if they do it went right out the window but again it's all about the views in the ratings most people watching the show that have no law-enforcement experience are not going to catch those type of discrepancies hell even when I watch cops which is an actual real police show cops always judge other cops so like when I watch cops I'm picking everything apart that they're doing wrong it's very easy a Monday Morning Quarterback but after doing this job for so long you notice officer safety issues you notice discrepancies in what they're doing but as a veteran officer with almost 11 years of experience and four and a half of those years on an actual SWAT team I'm calling [ __ ] on Patti Mayo that's my opinion and as far as the tactical stuff guys the biggest thing to remember about anything tactical tactical is what's between your ears it has nothing to do with the gear you have there are some pieces of gear that are better suited for certain scenarios than others but tactical is in your mind thinking planning and executing successfully that is tactical anyway guys thank you so much for watching I was excited to get this out to you guys a lot of you have been requesting me do something on Patti Mayo I know I didn't go fully in depth as much as doughnut operator did like I said I know I've said a few times now I really recommend you guys watch the donuts video he really did his homework on Patti Mayo but at the end of the day if you guys wanna watch Patti Mayo there's nothing wrong with that I can see where it would be entertaining it's not a horrible show but as far as its legitimacy again I'm calling [ __ ] on it I'm sorry I have to call [ __ ] on it there's too many discrepancies behind the scenes that are happening for me to to believe that this is some sort of a real show but if you're just in it for the entertainment then enjoy thank you guys so much for watching and I will see you guys very very soon [Music]", "QJ36AuQiwMo": "today we're doing the video so yeah why don't me [Music] [Music] now you got a few

blinky back again with another video today I'm gonna be looking at this fake heavy hitters cart and showing you guys the signs to look for when you're buying your own heavy hitters carts to see which ones are fake and which ones are real so let's go ahead and get into the video all right so there are five big signs to look for when it comes to identifying a fake over a real heavy hitters cart so I'm just gonna quickly go into each of those first up we have cold filtered at the top real heavy hitters carts that are sold as one gram cartridges do not say cold filtered at the top they just simply don't have that they just say all of this stuff so that's already a big red flag second red flag would be that California label on the inside of the box that I'm trying to show you guys that should not be there that should be blank and it should just have the hh4 heavy hitters on this silver foil type thing or the silver foil type paper on the inside of the packaging that California label that you see right there should actually be right here unauthentic heavy hitters packaging the third sign is right down here where you see the 2019 fluids manufacturing ink and all of that other [ __ ] that should not be there which should be there is this push to release embroidered into the Box where you have to tear it to open it you should not be able to open real cart boxes this easily because obviously that can make it easy for anyone to just put whatever they want into these boxes so the fourth sign would be right here where it says instructions that should actually say suggested use and then finally you have right here where it says Bubba cush that is not a strain that heavy-hitters offers in there one gram cartridges I'm gonna link the heavy-hitters website in the description but you can actually go there and see a list of every strain they offer so if your plug is trying to sell you one that's not on that list on their website then you know he's bullshitting you those are a few very quick signs that you can look at to see if you're gay faker a real heavy hitter skirt now I'm gonna go ahead and plug it into my battery take a few puffs on it to see how it tastes and see how it hits and I'll go ahead and come back tomorrow until you guys how the high is how it makes me feel and if these are even worth buying so yeah let's go ahead and get into that all right so the 710 carts that these heavy hitters are using are not DAB cap compatible unfortunately it's the same kind of tip that you can see in exotic carts it's sort of like a funnel but it's too small to actually clip on or not clip on but like attached itself to the dab cap so unfortunately I can't show you guys a rip through a rake but if these carts are actually decent I'll figure out how to do that for tomorrow so for now let's just go ahead and take a few puffs see how these cards taste and how they rip and I'll let you know my thoughts so cheers guys [Music] so off that rip I'm getting a bit of earthy taste it tastes kind of like dirt if I'm being honest it's not very pleasant but the smoke is really smooth and it doesn't really hurt my lungs while I'm hitting it so that's a good sign I'm gonna go ahead and take another rip and we'll see if I'm starting to feel the buzz off - so Cheers [Music] yeah I'm getting good cloud production on it I don't feel a buzz or anything but these are so it doesn't feel like a chore daf-2 puffs on this cart I'd actually definitely hit this thing all day so I'm gonna go ahead and do that I'll come back tomorrow and share my thoughts and we'll see if these cars are worth buying so I'll see you guys tomorrow all right guys so I'm going through so much [ __ ] to get this video done right now this is my third time recording this part of the video because the first time I recorded it I didn't press report the second time I recorded it I had a Miranda sings hairline so we cut that [ __ ] out I'm gonna leave the other half of this part in simply because like I don't want to re-record that I do not want to get that high again you'll see I was super fried during this F um and I look terrible but anyway so things I went over in the part where I had the bad hair line so I've used this hurt for two days now and I used it for two days because I didn't think one day was enough to get like a good read on the highs of the potency and all the other good stuff I like to review oh and what got cut out was when I was talking about the potency it's really good four to five hits gets you a nice buzz six to seven hits gets you high and then if you get to nine hits then you might be slow to order in space like this current really does hit heavy even if it's not like a legit heavy hitters cart um and yeah now I'll go back to myself in the past um to finish off the video so see you guys oh yeah and the camera angles suck right now because my tripod literally just broke while I was trying to finish this video so you know we're just having fun it's a it's a great time book ago or I'm right but uh yeah so I'm ordering new tripod so I can fix my ankles again we might have to go back to the old recording area yeah so channel updates yay next up we have how long these cards last I have been using this card for two days now and it's about 1/4 of the way done so that means I would probably last around eight days if you're lucky um I've also been sort of with this cart not gonna lie but it does get me high for a long time so like being sparing is also easy with it my next point is the flavour and wax quality I know in my initial review of it I said it just tasted like straight dirt but after hitting it a few more times I can start of I can sort of start to taste more earthy tones like when you taste coffee um it doesn't taste exactly like coffee but it does taste sweet and earthy like a coffee beverage would um I would highly recommend getting this cart honestly like the wax quality is decent it's very slow-moving which was it like a good sign for me and unlike what the TKO cart even though it's slow-moving this one actually does hit really [ __ ] hard um if you guys have these around you and they look around the same like quality as these ones I would highly recommend picking them up I would set these up like right there with tanks and dab woods um easily an 8 out of 10 um I already filmed this review and I'm really high right now so it's kind of hard to like keep a steady train of thought but I think all I have it done for the second half is take hits on camera so let's go ahead and take two rips out of the battery then we'll go and take two rips through violet and then we'll end the video so thank you guys so much for watching if you made it this far please leave in the comments what your favorite cart brand is right now because I'm trying to find new brands to try I already have dragon's breath on my list um and I really want to try ROH soon um but yeah and please in the comments stop telling me to try likes dizzy I can't try Suzy's even though I really want to so every time you all tell me to try as dizzy I just died a little bit more inside um where I live we don't have like studies all right so I cannot try though thanks for the suggestions though I really appreciate it and if I do ever find its dizzy the first thing I will do is record myself dry again so um yeah let's go ahead and get into these rips guys Cheers yeah it just tastes really good and the hits are actually starting to be pretty smooth off of it too um when I first recorded it I coughed like a [ __ ] after all of my hits but now that I'm already high all these sets just feel smooth and it tastes really good so let's go ahead and take another hit Cheers my throat bout dry as [ __ ] so let me go ahead and drink some water and then I'll take another hit I hope y'all can see how high I am right now cuz I believe is [ __ ] fried right anyway so Cheers [Music] I tried I tried to do a ghost I don't know if it showed but yeah but we tried all right anyway let's go ahead and take a few ribs through violet and then I'll end the video so the hard part is trying to figure out how to smooth these through a dab cap so I'm gonna get behind the camera and just show you real close-up like the easiest way to do it so that in case you guys have a dab cap in these kind of tips you can smoke them through rigs too so to get this with a dab cap this is so hard to hold with one hand you have to like put the dad cap upside down and then you just have to like hold the car on top of it see if it'll focus and then you just have to hold the car on top of it like that and that way it funnels into the piece anyway I'll go ahead and show you guys I hit yeah so just for the record real quick this will be my third hit through violet off off this cart since I've started my smoke sesh um and I've probably taken five hits of the cart like on just trying to do this review and I'm already like this fried so that should just speak for the like potency of this cart alright the pink incident I didn't realize all right I know this next hit is gonna send me so I'm gonna go ahead and say peace right now thank you so much for watching and I hope you guys stick around my next video is gonna be sort of a channel update I think and I'm gonna be talking about this giveaway that I want to do but yeah leave them in the comments some ideas of it keep it kind of like under a hundred bucks or around 100 bucks cuz I'm just having to pay for this out of pocket so thanks again for watching all of my

G Pharma TV here coming at you with another tutorial and today I'm going to give you a quick rundown on how to use the new and improved liquid gold vape pen comes packaged with just the mod and actually a key charger and you go ahead and charge your pen it will turn on red and when it's fully charged it will turn on green indicating that it's fully charged this 510 threading pen is compatible with both drug run and pure tanks 510 thread and cartridges and the first thing you want to go ahead and do after you put your cartridge on is simply turn on the panel by pressing the flash button five times five then you want to go ahead and activate the pre heating element by pressing the flash button two times we'll go ahead and see a mixture of all the colors and if you want to go ahead and stop it from the pre heating element I soon as you see the smoke you press that button once and you stop the creating mistake I do not recommend you to vape this cartridge while it is in increasing state after you're done preheating your oil it's ready to vape the first setting that it will go ahead and start off is when it's green setting which is the lowest voltage of the three three point six volt if you press the splash button three times it will then move the voltage from green to blue from the lowest setting to the highest setting at 4.00 voltage the draw difference between the green setting in the blue lady makes night and day I definitely got a bigger risk and it was a definitely a little bit more calm after the blue setting by simply pressing the splash button three it will drop down to the middle to the neutral blinking red you now know you're vaping it at its middle setting at 3.8 voltage now whatever setting you prefer adjust it try out the waters see what works best up for you when you're done and you have the voltage that fits your need just simply hold down the splash but in this pen and battery is designed to go ahead and turn off after eight seconds of date and automatically so we do this for your safety we understand you have lungs of Steel you get wine eight seconds of 18 per hit you can simply go ahead and let go before the eighth second and continue with your desire to have a bigger hit that's the small tip the new liquid gold vape in coming in assorted colors 510 threading and packaged with its own USB charger a new warmup feature when you click the splash button twice and you can go ahead and activate three voltage settings all color-coordinated by clicking a splash button three times and of course turn on your pin and turn it off with a simple 5 splash click go ahead and make sure you check out the closest retailer near you on G farmer navcom and if you're already making make the switch to a liquid gold vape in and

just wanted to let y'all know i'm taking a break from youtube for now i don't know how long it's going to be probably anywhere between like two weeks to two months honestly probably more than two weeks probably around the one or two month mark i just got stuff going on in life right now i got some goals i want to focus on and accomplish i got school i need to do i just got things to do in my actual life and you've probably noticed i'm not posting that much not i used to be posting daily but these days i'm not posting that much and i just hit 500 subscribers if i grind it i would probably be able to make it to the thousands but right now i just don't really have the time to be pumping out these videos so right now i'm gonna go on an indefinite break it's probably gonna be anywhere between a month or two months maybe even a short break like two weeks but that's just how it is for the moment i don't know when i'll get back but i will come back i'll still post at least once or twice more eventually but for the moment i am going to be taking a break i'ma see y'all when i get back peace", "JHc_YeC4MXA": "all right today I'm going to show you how to take care of an agave plant this one's pretty huge I'm six five and you can see just how big it is behind me here's the tools you need a ham saw because you never want to cut this with a power saw because if you do the juice will get on you and it's like fiberglass it hurts neat I protect you because you don't want to get the stuff in your eyes either you need gloves protect your hands and long sleeves even though it's a hundred degrees out I'm wearing long sleeves because if you get that stuff on your arms it's really going to hurt and then afterwards for digging up the pups we're going to use one of these pickaxes and we'll get to that in a minute okay so what I do to keep this thing maintained is when the leaves hit the ground and get all beat up at the end that's when I cut them off so when you want to use a handsaw keep in mind that tips on these well go right through your skull they're very sharp and the edges are like razors and it's real easy to get cut so you just got to be super careful so in this case I'm just going to crawl under it and try and saw it as close to the base as you can as you can see they're pretty thick takes a while to cut it down and look it's about four feet long probably weighs about five to ten pounds because this one's huge and this is where that snap comes out of has an interesting smell and that's it all right so if the thorns weren't enough looks like these fire ants decided to make a home inside one of the old leaves that was on the ground so I had a little run-in with them under there so that's just one more thing to look out for in this part of country okay so to get the pups we got two right here I use a pickaxe and just kind of get around the back of them because the root usually goes to the base of the agave so I get behind them oh look there's actually another pop coming up back here I'm just gonna ignore that one for now I usually wait till about they're about this size sometimes it takes a lot of digging and kind of soil that agave is like times it can be a lot of work okay so when you get to the root a little bit sometimes you can just reach down with your hand wiggle it free and there's a little bit of root here it's enough to get it to grow in a pot and that's what we'll be doing next so the last step just taking a pot and nice people lows actually gave me these because they were recycling rather than throwing them away and just put a bunch of dirt in there can be soil or whatever this compost then put your gobby in there and fill in the rest and then you can give them away or sell them I probably give it away about a hundred of these guys so far so the gift that keeps on giving it's an cleaned up it'll last like this for probably about four to six months I'll just do it again rode nice and big and strong this one I planted when it was about two feet tall and it was about six or seven years ago and now it's about eight feet tall just to let you know and other than the care that's in this video I didn't do anything I didn't even water it but my neighbor might run his sprinklers a little more than I do so I might have him to thank for its size main thing is just to get in the Sun and leave it alone other than what I showed you so here's what I got from the pups today two of these are from Outback they're actually grande pups so the big one because they're plants that are a couple feet tall now that we're originally straight from this big one so um I usually give these away you could sell them for a couple bucks you could grow them a little while and sell them for more make a little farm whatever you want to do but they're really pretty plants have fun", "zXvIqpVzO7k": "[Music] thank you for watching ganja runner TV I'm Jake Gloria and today we have Lauren from heavy hitters here with us and she's gonna tell us all about their vapor cartridges yeah so heavy hitters is an awesome cartridge company it's all a distillate so these are distilled eight times total and on the 8th time they actually take the temperature almost to the point of freezing what that does is really just takes out all the plant fats and lipids that don't need to be in the product it just makes it a Lord clean and compact hit for you guys so would that be why is very clear yeah basically the clarity is a lot better it's also a little bit more fluid so you're gonna pull a larger hit a lot faster so how do I use this ah so we did just introduce the button battery just for a heavier hit we actually did invert the button so you're less likely to accidentally use it so how does one get a heavy hit what constitutes a heavy hit so to get the heaviest hit we actually do suggest holding down the button for five to eight seconds just to warm the cart just so when you pull it's immediately pulling the concentrate not warming up the cart the first one is Jack Herer this is our most uppity cart it's gonna keep you the most awake and kind of buzzing so it's actually five times to turn it on and then you would just hold down okay [Music] yeah so these don't automatically turn off say about that amount of time would be good the test actually you really taste like what yeah yeah so that's definitely a string specific one FARC we use all natural flavoring nothing artificial so the strain specific cards are going to be flavored with specific strains from the plant the plant champions and then our flavored ones will actually be using the fruit dripping Wow all right we can do a pineapple express this is on my favorites because it's fruity as well as string specific so I just feel like it's overall you have like it's a good hybrid good for any time of the day and it just strain I'll never get tired of [Music] and almost tastes like a like a little bit piney yeah so I just think it has a little bit of everything in there do you want to try it yeah okay this is one of my favorite self yeah it's kind of like excuse me oh man okay so we're back just a pineapple express and that was

always, it'll work with that blade only Keep the blade on top of it We'll start squeezing it for juice Hold it tightly while making juice It might go outside in the force , hold it tightly Seeds will remain in the juicer Juice is now ready We'll make orange juice in the same way It gives a bitter taste if we blend it in the normal mixer jar It'll blend together with the outer skin , seeds While making in this juicer, bitter taste will not be there Using this blade, we are going to knead dough for chappathi / poori Add 1 or 2 spoons oil Add salt as required I'll add little sugar to chapathi dough Add Wheat flour Add 1 glass of water Added 2 glasses of wheat flour 1 glass of water Adding one more glass of water Added 3/4 th water only Adding little water only Add 1/4 th glass water only if it is required If you are kneading it for chappathi, knead little soft, for poori little tight 2-3 minutes is enough to knead Chappathi dough is now ready Apply little oil on top of it If you are kneading in this , you can start making chapathis immediately Chappathi dough is now ready I have taken this blade We can make juice I'm gonna make water melon juice, chopped into small pieces Water melon juice is now ready We'll start making carrot juice Peal the outer skin, cut  and then add Cut it front and back and then add Carrot juice is also ready now I'll show you how to grind batter for idly I have washed the urad dal and soaked in water Water is there upto this level Add without water We'll use this water while grinding We'll start with urad dal and grind it switch On it for 2 times

guys", "j0fd8iVzE78": "hey dr. Shawn Mira vici here and it's time for another cannabis product review today I'm reviewing the San Rafael 510 cartridge starter kits now the starter kit comes with three components you get your vape pen battery you get a charger that fits into the 510 threading just kind of twists in so and that's a USB charger charging takes about like a couple hours maybe and you also get your cannabis extract cartridge in this case in the starter kit that they were offering on the OCS is the tangerine dream cartridge and that fits in the 510 threading as well just like that so I'll put that together so you can see what that kind of looks like so overall it's a little bit larger than the disposable vape pen that I reviewed previously but it's not that much larger it still kind of resembles a pen and very easy to carry around so let's start with San Rafael in general so I talked a little bit about them in the previous video that I did all you really need to know is they're a reputable brand I have talked with some of their head office here in Toronto they're all very passionate about their products and everything meets the highest of standards so good products coming from these guys now I did the disposable pen in my last video and one of the things I didn't like about that or the whole disposable pen market is that it creates a lot of waste so one thing right off the bat that I like about the 510 cartridge line of vapes is that they're rechargeable so at least the battery should last about a year at least so not as much waste and you get to kind of try out a few different types of cartridges with this model so you're paying less per kind of product per cartridge and so I kind of like how you can test out other cartridges just with the same battery and the really nice thing about the San Rafael starter kit was that it was like under fifty dollars for the charger the pen and you even get your starter cartridge of tangerine dream in this case so right from the get-go I think it's kind of a superior product to the disposable pen now let's talk about actually try and get out so the way that you turn on this particular one is and this is another thing that I like about it it has a self locking mechanism so it's sort of there childproof proofing system so to unlock the battery you have to click it five times oops I think I clicked it one too many but you'll see a little light come on and there's temperature control options so if I click it probably a bit hard to see but it just went into oh this is a preheat mode and if I click it again one two three ah that's it so three clicks will change the heating on it so it's got three settings low medium and high high gives off sort of a red light low is a green light and that's flashing right now I've been using it at the medium setting which is a one two three a blue light so and then to relock it for child safety and and just to preserve battery power you click it five times again and then the unit will kind of lock itself whereas in the disposable pens it's simply activated by you breathing in so really anyone could grab it and start breathing in and it will start activating so that's another reason I like this kind of system better than the disposable pen system now when it comes to actual vapor this has been way better in terms of the quality of the vapor that it puts off than the disposable pen so one thing I did I forgot to mention when I was reviewing the pink cush San rafeal disposable pen is that the vapor almost at times had sort of a burnt taste to it and so that might be the battery because the the battery on the disposable pens doesn't have heat settings so the battery I think was maybe overheating the extract a little bit and giving off the sort of burnt taste I did not get any burnt taste from using this pen and so the tangerine dream extract is really good it tastes really good it tastes like tangerines and smells like tangerines there's almost like zero cannabis e flavor to it so that was really nice and the effects were I felt much more multi-dimensional I know I like using that term a lot but I felt the the pinkish was a bit flat in terms of the effects it was kind of just making me feel a little kind of tipsy whereas I found the tangerine dream made me gave me more of sort of a full body relaxation and I tell you that came just in time because I've had a really bad flare-up of shoulder pain I have a shoulder injury and so I've been using this through for some of my break through pain and it's been helping quite a lot so in terms of the actual quality of the vapor I like this one a lot better than the than the pinkish disposable pen it'd be interesting to see if they have a pinkish cartridge trying it in the 510 system and seeing if that's different than the pink cushion the disposable pen because I know that they have a disposable version of the tangerine dream so I wonder what the differences would be with those two maybe I'll do that for a future review but overall was really liking the system there's actually not a lot I didn't like about it every once in a while the air-intake got a little bit sticky but nothing like what I was experiencing with the disposable pen and the battery life is quite good I've been using this for two weeks and I've had to charge it once and I basically have been using it pretty much you know five days of the week and sometimes a couple times a day if I'm having a lot of pain in the shoulder so yeah I really like this I'm going to give it mmm it's a tricky one I don't like giving too high marks but I really like this so I would say a nine out of ten maybe a light nine out of ten there's always room for improvement but really liked this product a lot and I'm looking forward to trying some of the other cartridges and see how they compare to the tangerine dream cartridge so so that's about it for the 510 so I would say if you're going to go down the disposable pen or sorry not the disposable pen but the vape pen route definitely think about getting the 510 thread cartridge system rather than a disposable pen I think the quality is much better it's got extra safety mechanisms in there it's got temperature control so there's just so much more you're getting out of this system so again that's that's it for the San rafeal starter kit from the OCS and yeah I did mention the price it's about I think it was 48 dollars or something so really quite reasonable thanks for watching guys and stay tuned I'll be back with another cannabis review for you shortly", "8NmxSvH-aeo": "[Music] foreign

foreign [Music] foreign ice cream [Music] [Music] is", "SLihlyzlkHE": "hey guys new cat discount vape pen and today we're gonna help you answer the question what is the best voltage for my cartridge [Music] alright guys so here we have two different kinds of batteries for you as well as two different kind of cartridges to kind of meet up a couple different scenarios and you could kind of just get a good idea for yourself what might be best for you to hit your cartridge at so I think the more important part of this is actually gonna be the batteries um so you can see here we have a spinner type battery and for those of you who aren't sure what that means is if you look here you have a little dial with varying numbers um so you can see start at 3.3 volts that's that's your power selection and you see what I did there how I could spin this little dial on the bottom you could increase the power up to different settings or come down so as you see I'm scrolling up to 3.8 this would be 3.9 ok 4 and so on so you could just keep increasing it decreasing it and go into different settings in between pretty much exactly what you want to do make it very customizable the alternative method would be a battery like this which doesn't at first look like it has any adjustments but what these are is gonna be a click style adjuster so we turn it on which is already on you can see that the color is green that's gonna signify a set voltage if we do three clicks just see the color flash and now that's an it's next setting so you have three three three presets of voltage increase all right so now just more - talking to that Oh like we just saw this guy is gonna have your three presets where you know you can scroll between three point four three point seven and four which is nice to be able to adjust but again with this spinner battery we can we can really change the dial and do the in-betweens of those settings so it's a whole lot more customizable and if you really want to pinpoint on exactly where you want to be this is gonna be your way to do it you know here you can see three point three and three point you know look that would be like consider to jump but here we can go in between I really do what we want if we want to settle it down or turn it up a little in between those presets of this guy that's what's great about the spinner batteries now how that's gonna affect your cartridges as you can see we have two different cards is here this is gonna be a ceramic type cartridge and you can see the heating element with with the way the wick holes are versus this guy which is gonna be one of your more old-school wick cartridges now the ceramic is gonna be able to take more power these are gonna be better at higher voltages the very low force is where you're gonna want to cap these out at so like you know four point two really should be the highest you're gonna consider going with these there are a few out there on the market that'll need more and at that point I would say just keep it at four point two and then if you feel like you need a bump turn it up just ever so slightly you know possibly with a spinner battery cuz that's gonna be your best way to do that and just come up and don't be afraid you know but also you know don't go too high can't start and then we have the alternative which would be your your cotton wick cartridges these guys aren't gonna be so good on keeping a higher power setting you're really gonna want to try to stick to around 3.6 3.7 3.8 I wouldn't I really wouldn't want most of these into the pores I have seen one or two in the past that have needed a little bit higher of a power setting but it's very rare so yeah just to kind of realize your bit your best way is gonna be keep it low see how it feels take a solid hit and then if you feel like you need a little more turn it up ever so slightly whichever way you may be doing that whether it's with your spinner battery which would be a little more I'm coming up in the small lengths or you can do it with your click button adjuster which that guy is gonna bring you to the next preset hopefully that next preset is gonna be in them after that close up hopefully you have a better idea of what the proper voltage to hit your 510 cartridge job would be um like we said it's really gonna depend more so on the battery um if you have one of the ones that has an adjustable adjustable slider on it like a spinner type battery it's better for finding exactly where you want to be because you'd go into the in-betweens that a 3 click wouldn't provide you so for example like we said this guy you click 3 times and it goes into one setting and the next setting in the next which is great because you can kind of take high medium low depending on what kind of cartridge you have but if you have a spinner battery it's really gonna allow you that freedom to go in between all those different sights you really find the perfect setting for your specific cartridge now the cartridge also does matter to like you know if you have ceramic which is going to be you know you can tell that it's ceramic if you look at it to see little Whipple's in the bottom that can be hit at a higher setting those are okay the low fours you know three point eight four four point two those are all going to be okay for most of the ceramic type cartridges if you have a conduit cartridge like this guy where you can see cotton exposed to through the center that's going to be on the lower head where you're at you know 3.6 3.8 maybe 3.9 again different company different cartridges by different companies they're gonna have the power requirements so there's a little bit of play play wiggle room on you kind of just figuring out based on what you have but either way these batteries will also provide you with the perfect hit depending on you know what setting you want to keep it at that's the partisan brand other than that I mean you just kind of use a little bit of common sense - depending on if they hit feels like it's enough you know that that's it you don't need to go any higher try to keep it as low as you can know what that being said that should really give you all the employee to know about that if you like the new these products they're available for purchase on our website at discount vape pen calm you feel like the video give us a like and subscribe [Music] [Applause] you", "HrDbe_WPuHc": "how's going YouTube this is outs coming at you for TV TV in the studio with a very special video for you today I'm super excited about this one we have the best oil pens and 510 threaded batteries of 2020 a lot of your experience will come down to your battery cartridge and oil all working together in harmony but the battery is the thing you have the most control over so choosing one or even multiple batteries that match your needs is the most important thing obviously the better the battery the better your experience will be with your cartridge and oil also because these batteries are relatively inexpensive and you might find yourself with multiple carts it's perfectly OK to own up more than one of them I personally have three that I cycle through if at any point you like this video throw us a thumbs up would you if you're gonna go scrubbing your way through it at least leave us a like before you bounce and if you'd like to pick up any of the batteries I talked about today links will be in the description below without further ado let's get into it sitting in our number one spot this year is the tronie inline of 510 batteries trone ian landed in the market with a splash releasing a handful of batteries all at once the line consists of three batteries the neutron hITRON and tau tron and an oil cartridge called the tron pod they also have a disposable battery which I'll touch on later what I like about Rhoni and batteries is that they've nailed the space between budget-friendly and performance with a device for every consumer their units are versatile and calibrated to work more effectively with a wide range of 510 cartridges and oils the patron is one of the cheapest and smallest offerings of the Tyrolean line along with a distinct pen shape it also has draw activation which works with any draw activated cart so make sure you check the instructions on your cartridge before choosing a battery the Piton battery is built sturdily and can handle any size 510 threaded car it has 350 ml amp hours of power which is impressive for a unit of this size and price point and I absolutely love that there is a USB charger on the bottom of the device it couldn't possibly be any easier to use just screw your cartridge on and inhale the neutron is another incredibly budget-friendly battery and just like the patron comes in at under $15 offering a very similar pen shape the neutron has a one button three voltage settings and a preheat function the on-board voltages are two point six three point three and 4.0 volts giving you a large range to work with that preheat function I touched on before does a great job of warming thicker oils and concentrates it is universally compatible and should be able to power most carts you throw at it five tabs will turn it on two will change between temperatures and three will activate that preheat function it is no larger than a literal pen and can be completely hidden by most hands for some stealth vaping at the top of their lineup is the Tao Tron the Tao John features a magnetic adapter for your carts that you can easily screw on to the base of your 510 threaded cartridge that will allow the cartridge to slip completely inside the housing protecting your car from damage the couch on has been designed to automatically detect the resistance of your cartridge and is calibrated to accept almost any viscosity of oil when fully charged it has a max voltage of 4.2 volts when you draw from the tower on there's a light that illuminates at the bottom of the device to show that power is being supplied to your cartridge the design is just super clean and I love the fact that they have cutouts to show your oil levels which is certainly a feature I prefer for my batteries there's nothing worse than taking a dry head it is draw activated and features a 380 million power battery that charges via USB and even for the top of their line the tower on is extremely budget-friendly I like everything about this device from the size to the power I love how small the tower on is it's shorter than other pens it's smaller than other mods it just works and that's why it's my number one choice I know a lot of your experience is gonna be down to buying prefilled cartridges but for those who like to fill their own cartridge Choa nyan has also released the Tron pod the Tron pods are perfectly calibrated from the tronie in line to offer maximum efficiency they also offer better wicking than most cartridges on the market meaning less time waiting and filling and less dry hits I've also been told some oil producers will be working with Tony and to get these Tron pods filled so keep an eye out for that lastly TRO nyan does offer their disposable vape pen the alphatron the alphatron is the solution for anyone looking for a disposable pen that also has a childproof lock it is designed for one-time use and is geared towards those who prefer to fill up their own cartridges the battery comes pre charged with enough juice to finish the attached Tron pod considering you get an empty cartridge and a battery for the price it's not bad at all the literal only issue I have with it is the spelling alpha with an F come on people as a Greek boy I cannot stand by and watch this travesty happen alpha is spelt with a pH okay droning sitting in our number-two spot this year we have the vessel battery if you are a classy as [ __ ] oh no sir with a need for the top of the top rugged devices look no further than the vessel it is a seriously gorgeous device that comes in a plethora of colors to suit your tastes there are three voltage settings on the vessel 2.8 3.2 and 3.6 bolts there is a notable difference between the voltage settings as well and the vessel can handle any cartridge with aplomb I've been using mine for a while now and I've never put a cartridge in that it could handle if you have a wider diameter cart you will have to forego the shield but it's super easy to take off the vessel is a 240 million power battery that you can get about a hundred rips on before it needs to be recharged it is slightly larger than your average oil pen but it's nothing to write home about as it still fits in any pocket or bag and the included cartridge protector can stave off most dents and scratches and keep your cartridge safe I really like the performance and look of this device it makes me feel super classy as I'm taking ribs in an alleyway on my way to the grocery store the price point is a bit high but if you want a top-of-the-line high performance device the vessel is the battery for you in the number three spot we have the tried and tested and true pocket one plus a great device with a lot of versatility the pocket oneplus has a wide cartridge area and can accept almost any cart you throw at it don't throw your carts at it and then blame me and please just don't do it don't it also works with top and bottom airflow cartridges which is pretty cool the pocket oneplus is another solid device that protects your carts from breaking it also has that magnetic adapter just like the tower on the and it has three temperature settings which is just the icing on the cake it runs up three point seven four point three and five point one volts if anyone cares I use the preheat function quite a bit yes it does have a pretty heat function another thing to love about the pocket oneplus the pocket oneplus has a 660 million hour battery that should last you a number of days even if you're a heavy user ok this is not a challenge don't come back to me and say I hit it 483 times in 30 minutes and the battery died that battery tops up in about 45 minutes which is also pretty great the oneplus is a great size and the button placement is spectacular I'm laughing because I might be the only person that cares about button placement but seriously it's great 5 clicks will turn it on to will change temperature 3 will activate that preheat function it's just simple to use just like the vessel the price point is a touch high but if you're willing to shell out a couple extra bucks you will certainly not be disappointed coming in at number four the C cell battery lineup has two great devices for use with your favorite oil the palm is a great budget-friendly device that is built really well it protects your cartridge and features a 500 million power battery simply screw the magnetic adapter onto your cartridge and slot it into the base the palm fits easily inside your hand great chest and is a great buddy for a night out the silo is the palms slightly bigger brother it keeps most of the same features we loved about the palm like that 500 milliamp hour battery and the fact that it protects your cart the silo fits into any pocket and you won't be worried about any damage to your cart because of that card protection I touched on earlier it also has the little newer slot so you can monitor the level of your oil in the cartridge there is no voltage control to speak up on either C cell device but for the price point I don't see that as a big drawback at all I personally find the silo to have a slightly better form factor and I just like the way it fits in my hand either way C cell batteries are built really well and a solid pick for any user the only thing I would note the narrower cartridge opening means they are not universally compatible but again a minor issue sitting in our number 5 spot the Lynx herm\u00e8s 3 is a solid pen this ultra slim slick device does a good job of pumping out clouds but where it really shines is flavor the ceramic atomizer does a good job of pulling the terpenes out of your oil it has three voltage settings to customize the flavor and the density of your clouds the atomizer doesn't leak and wicks really well this is a solid choice for anyone who sources their own oil and wants a refillable device complete with a tank as the atomizer is really good quality and can handle being refilled multiple times the kit itself comes with the pen the USB charger and the handy carrying case which is really typical of links and just gives you everything you need also typical is their consistency with build quality as the hermes 3 is a well-built device that features a 290 million power battery it's super easy to use five taps will turn it on three will change voltage settings and as long as your buddy Jon knows how to press a button and inhale at the same time you should be okay to pass this around at parties without having to explain to anything I'll leave the choice on whether or not to do so up to you and that's it for this one guys thank you so much for watching this video I hope I helped you even a little bit to choose the

inside the blue pineapple bakery we've made progress from the last video that we are here what you see behind us is the kitchen area we can made some progress there what will be in front of you will end up be in the display cases registry to check out we're kind of in that in-between stage of finishing things up waiting on some equipment and some materials to come in to finish the project I can attest to the quality of the product I had my birthday cake made by miss Jenny plier the owner here at blue pineapple and the cake was outstanding everybody loved it so excited to get Ginny and the blue pineapple open so we're back into the kitchen area here at the blue pineapple which we'll see behind us Ginny is trying to get everything set up so it's a little bit of chaos going on here in terms of the setup but we were figuring this space out for behind you'll see the ovens freezers in the corner here is a three compartment sink with the grease trap limited space here so we had a lot of parts to kind of get into a compressed area but we were able to do that and this kitchens gonna be super functional for her it takes a lot of cohesiveness to work with the owner to kind of keep costs down so we've tried to partner with Ginny to give her the vision that she had in her mind created it within that budget and so that takes a lot of working together and giving Ginny the tools that she needs for success again a lot of the main components are in place here got a lot of FRP corner guards on everything to be able to keep it nice and clean vinyl coated ceiling tiles again to keep everything nice and clean and we got a lot of dough and stuff flying so again excited to get this thing wrapped up give you the final kitchen layout in the next video so we'll check in with it in you", "aHftmh3-OYk": "all right so today we are gonna be doing ace I'm gonna be doing a video on the legendary RC car and we're gonna tap out on my truck I have a little one right over on the road so

peace", "F1Gj0gPR_Lk": "hey everyone how's it going hope you're having a great day today we're gonna be answering some questions that you sent to us through YouTube or Instagram and yeah everybody's gonna be anonymous for privacy purposes so here we go question number one new to vaping what factor does voltage play in to vaping amazing question first of all I would say in order to understand voltage you need to understand mas casa t so viscosity is just the thinness or the thickness of your oils so if you have a thick oil which basically you can tell by flipping over your cartridge upside down and if it doesn't move or takes forever in a day to move you have a thick oil if it takes like five seconds probably a medium and then if it's almost instantly you got a you got a thin oil so thinner oils would need a lower voltage and thicker oils would need a higher voltage if you vape thin oils on a higher voltage you run the risk of burning the oil itself and if you vape thicker oils at low temperatures it might not heat up all of the oil in and you might not get the draw that you're looking for also cartridges play a factor into this sometimes because of the air hole but that's a whole nother video I'll link I'll put a link to it like right around here somewhere so you want to make sure that you get the full inhalation of your draw and you also want to make sure that you're not burning your oils either alright question number two can I refill my cartridge with new oils absolutely I would say don't do it more than twice otherwise you run the risk of clogging old oils might get stuck in there and so don't burn your new oils correctly you might lose flavor taste vapor production it could leak you know because it's just over time I mean you know you want to change the oil in your car and with this it's just like this is you're actually inhaling it and this is going in your body so you want the best quality of you know oil that you can find plus if you're like a flavor chaser and you know somebody who likes to try and taste different strains you know it's best if you change your oils you know once maybe twice and then dispose of them because they're they're not meant to last forever next question says do these work with normal vape liquids no no they don't uh vape liquid is too thin it'll drip out it'll leak out into the battery you know that you'll have connectivity problems if you do that I wouldn't put a juice in it odds these aren't meant for a juice how do I put a juice into my ex5 cartridge so again not free juice but all the cartridges that we sell they're all top fill so you unscrew the top cap or if it's plastic and it has a plug you just fill down the plug if it's a ceramic mouthpiece just take the mouthpiece off fill it around the heating tube because the heating tube is gonna or the heating post is gonna be directly down the center there's gonna be a hole down there where you can look straight down through it that's where the air flow comes from do not put anything in there what you want to do is have the oil drip around that post touching the glass and and being on the inside of the glass you want to be able to see the oil rise up you don't want if you put it through that post you're not gonna be able to see anything it's just gonna leak straight down into your battery and the ex5 cartridge is as a top fill you just remove it I believe the heating post is actually connected to the mouthpiece so you just squeeze it on in there it's it it's it's a dope it's a dope cartridge you can control the air flow through it - it's pretty hardcore um next question how long do I inhale while holding the button so the button will usually just hold for a good 10 to 15 seconds and you uh you can't you can't hold it for for more than that but usually as soon as you put the cartridge you know to inhale you're gonna hold the button down and then let go when you're done and just you know it won't last more than 15 seconds and then the really the rest is just up to you how long do I have to charge the battery for it does the pen light have to flash or the battery and the charger have to stay green so I know it's full it really depends on the unit you have and for the most part for the most part pins that have adapted connectors or you plug you plug them into the 510 threading you plug that into a computer it's gonna light red and hold red and then it will transition into green and hold green if it's something like this sometimes they'll flash 20 times I know the snap flash is 20 20 times and this one it flashes eight times and then it goes blank um you know just read the instructions I would say so to answer your first question how long do you charge the battery I would say no more than two hours you know some even less than an hour depending you got to watch them and get to know it you know it's something that you're gonna be carrying around in your pocket with you all day every day you know so it's good to know like what what you have on your body but usually what I would do is when I first get it use it up let it die twice charge it for two hours and then never past one hour again alright and can you use it while charging he was talking about the wolf duo no you cannot you cannot use it while it's charging it's not it doesn't have a bypass on it but this one does this is the wolf uni you can charge it or yeah you can't vape it while you're charging it next question hey I just got a new cartridge and whenever I put it in my uni just flashes but when I put in another cartridge it works fine what should I do the best method is basically what you did you know you tried another cartridge inside of the battery and it works so you ruled out that the battery was fine it was just the cartridge that I was having an issue the cool thing about all vaporizers is that they'll try to talk to you they'll try to okay with you if it's something internal with the cartridge it'll probably read as a misfire which will flash three times if it's something as simple as like the cartridge is fine the battery is fine maybe there's a magnet involved it's just not getting a connective touch to it it just can't read the cartridge it'll flash five times just an error like that it could be something like with the magnets you know the magnet might not be screwed into the proper length so sometimes maybe you want to back off the magnet a little bit from the from the cartridge itself back it off put it back in and see if that works so right now it's telling me one two three four five that means I cannot it cannot read the cartridge there's nothing wrong with the cartridge nothing wrong with the vapin but five times tells me that it's just not connecting to the battery so when I screw it back on I put it back in I'm able to get some draws try different cartridges different batteries different batteries and different cartridges kind of rule them out rule out problems if they indicate if you don't understand what the indicator is trying to tell you other than that I would say you know give customer service a call I'm sure we can take care of it for you that'll do it for today guys hope that was helpful let us know if you want to see more of these send in your questions I want to know I want to answer them but yet peace", "_vGVnBIqGV8": "[Music] hey guys Phil here from got vape when I first started vaping I would always leave my batteries and cartridges inside of my car because I couldn't take them to work and then when I came back from work I would always have leaky batteries leaky cartridges and that was really before I looked into proper maintenance of my oil cartridges so today I wanted to share a few tips I've learned along the way that I'll help you get the most out of your oil cartridge oil cartridges are great great for my producing they preserve your contents for a lot longer like most devices it's the small things that go a long way save you time save you money frustration but you don't want to take advantage of this by refilling new oils in the same oil cartridge do not fill your cartridge more than twice why is this bad to do well if you keep refilling the same cartridge over and over again it can cause leaking clogging lots of paper production thick oils will begin to harden on the wick and you won't be able to vape new oils properly stuck in an endless loop pulsing for good drawls and there's a special circular inhale for things like that especially you'll burn the cotton and the oils and once that happens even the best tasting oils they won't be able to mask it I like to think of it like oil in a car you wouldn't want to change your oil too often without changing your filter and the cotton inside of your atomizer is like the filter in your car you can go and get new oil but without changing the filter you never really have clean oil don't do what I did and leave your cartridges inside of your car or any hot place for that matter I know it might be convenient but for most you out there a good rule of thumb is heat bad cold good high temperatures can not only degrade the oil taste and potency but it can cause leaking the best places to store your oil vapes are cool dry dark places like a desk drawer or a refrigerator put the rubber plug back onto the bottom of the cartridge and start it ideally in a dark place around 70 degrees Fahrenheit or less but don't go too far to the extreme to the other side when stored in the freezer because that can create moisture inside of the cartridge so avoid heat and avoid freezers but now when you take your cartridge out of the fridge the oils gonna be thick and all thick oils need to be primed first priming your new oil cartridge is going to make the difference between the first hit being smooth and magical or dry and burn the nasty teetsi oil is thick so you need to give it some time to soak into the atomizer here's how to do it make sure your oils are at room temperature if they're fresh out of the fridge pull the cartridge in between your palms for about two to three minutes to warm it up if you're loading an empty cartridge only fill it with a small amount so if you run into problems you don't waste all your oil take about five polls on the cartridge without the battery being attached what you're doing is simulating vaping and pulling a little oil from the atomizer then attach the cartridge to the battery and give it a try I recommend pulsing the battery here it's the best way to ensure that you're not burning your oils if it's still too cold go back and warm it up and then try it again so there you have it guys those are the main ways to get the most out of your oil cartridge dont refill it more than twice always prime your new coils and always keep them in a cool dark place to prevent it from leaking on you keep in mind that not all cartridges have wigs some only come with ceramic or glass cores it's your responsibility to know what you're buying it's always smart to clean the bottom of the cartridge before storing it with cotton swabs or alcohol wipes that way when you take the rubber cap back off you can see if it's leaked hopefully these tips helped you guys where do you personally store your cartridges if you have any other questions leave them in the comments below let us know subscribe to god vape for more videos

tried this um particular um big chief i've had all of them except this one and um what's it called i know y'all wanted me to do reviews on some plug and plays buddies curtains and yeah i got a pl i got a plug for plug-and-plays and [ __ ] but i'm i'm probably gonna do some plug-and-play reviews later like probably like in a couple weeks or so but i'm gonna just be trying to get new products and [ __ ] and trying to do reviews again like i'm gonna try to get the reviews back and going because i was doing a lot of reviews in the beginning and then i started switching it up and doing like everything else but you i like i like mixing in the content up whenever i don't have new [ __ ] to review boomer i have new [ __ ] to review i'll do reviews but yeah this is pineapple express and yes it was wrapped up in [ __ ] boys anybody could spot a fake big chief in my area bro like honestly there's like big chiefs are so common over here and i hardly ever get big chiefs now i used to smoke on these a lot like i try not to get them as much but i only get them whenever like i'm running whenever i don't have as much money because usually when i have my a lot of money most of the time i get

tasting big cheap is probably like sunset gelato and i haven't had that big chief in like six months because i don't really have big cheese a lot so i've only had like three big chiefs in like the last three four months yeah like the last three four months i've only had like three four big chiefs something like that yeah they're ca certified and [ __ ] y'all didn't know bro go look it up

issue with ego type batteries now what happens is this little bit here this pillar that's what makes connection to this in the middle of the cart or your attic whatever now when you use different sized car toes and outies you will end up screwing down woodenly needs go off and see that's actually connected and if you can hear that that's firing but oftentimes will just get screwed down one you mean - so when you unscrew your center pins actually push down a little in the middle so that bit gets crushed the arty has free movement up and down the little bit in there so sorry about the background noise that's just my daughter doing some cooking you can't cheat at any if you saw the way I did that you just tease it up litchi I'm just using a little Christmas cracker screwdriver poke it in one side give it a little left poking yeah we're giving it a little lift to make it even welcome to the learning book there we go so that should just once again fire absolutely find so literally it's just the case of popping that little center pin just sliding it up and you just gotta be a little bit careful because apparently you can break the connection so if you can tease the center pin up from a bratty you're using apparently it's best to try and do it on that first personally I find it quite hard to do on these ones so I usually just end up a little bit up on here so there you go if you have any problems anything just isn't firing but other stuff is working you got any go type connector or center pin arrangement then it's most likely that all right good luck have a good one knows", "gvwsYYIPHx8": "what's up YouTube and today I don't know so nothing that's all I'm just kidding he's a good dog he's maybe so how did the kipper say hey yeah dog that's all the way downstairs

the differences so beyond just talking about events that happened in the anime or manga just like the cold hard facts of what has happened in discussing it I'm gonna take it a step further in some episodes and be talking about war concept bound ideas so things like perceptions and stereotypes and what people think of anime stands or fans or weaves you know what people call them so that's basically what the podcast is gonna be about I'm gonna be talking mostly one piece maybe even all of them peace but also some of those conceptual ideas maybe sometimes talking about other series if I

showing the fruit being eaten in a rather unorthodox way and it's dividing fans the world over the short video comes from East Asia and was posted to the media sharing site tik-tok before spreading to twitter as you can see there's no slicing or dicing it's simply eaten in pieces well the pineapple pull apart is a popular watch and in just a few days the video has gone viral over 18 million times and so others have tried to do the same at varying levels of success there's even a hashtag pineapple hack we wonder how many of you in Asia right now are try this around the breakfast table", "Riip2cBNvwA": "[Music] hi I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today I'm gonna go over one of our new items which is the honey stick Gold Line vape pen now a lot of you guys have hit us up and said why don't you guys just do a simple battery for us and you know it never really dawned on me to do that because we make them for a lot of our clients but I guess we've always spent our time making complex batteries and making you know really performance-oriented batteries but there's no reason that we shouldn't give you guys a really high-quality just basic battery for the guys that are traveling or the guys that really just want to get started into vaping and you know don't want something like a concealer or you know a variable voltage mod that is you know more complex something like like our honey stick speed Edition battery or even our subohm battery and so we came out with a really good stick battery that we made available on our website and even before we could launch this video a lot of you guys took advantage and just started gobbling them up so looks like you were right we should just offer a stick battery so let me get into what makes this stick battery special because of course we still got a pillow honey stick spin on it so it comes in a little case that's just gonna slide out of the box you're gonna have a little high quality micro USB charger that will plug into the battery and then you're gonna get your battery they're a high-gloss black most ones in there a little tight so they're a high-gloss black it's gonna be a push button operation on an auto draw we made this one a little bit wider so that it will line up flush even with some of the wider tanks now let me show you an example this is one of the widest tanks on the market at this moment and it lines up perfectly so oh so a lot of people will not will buy a regular stick battery and get one of these really high-performance wide tanks and then it kind of hangs over the edges and really just doesn't look cool and have a good finish now this battery is 510 thread so it will fit you know 99% of the cartridges that are out there we made sure that we made the connectors space in a way that it's gonna line up resistance wise and pin wise to fire a majority of the cartridges out there so you're not gonna have any incompatibility issues when you go to your dispensary and pick up whatever cards or your vape shop to pick up your CBD tanks it's push button operation so it's gonna be come to you locked now you're gonna have to charge your battery before you start using it because it comes only with a very minimal charge and we placed for convenience it's not a screwin battery we place the microUSB cable Inlet on the bottom of the battery so you can actually have it plugged in and still continue to use it so you don't have to take the tank apart most stick batteries you have to screw the the charging port into the actual where you would put the tank so you just take the USB cable plugs in you're gonna hear it click it's gonna be nice and secure and then you're gonna take the other end of this and plug it into a USB wall adapter the average charging time for this battery is gonna be about two and a half to three hours and how are you gonna know that it's charging well there's a little bitty light right there that is gonna light up for you and when that light goes green or after a while it will just turn off completely and it's been about two and a half hours that means your battery is fully charged and ready to vape so all of our batteries do come locked so you are gonna click it five times and you're gonna see it illuminate there and each one of these batteries is actually variable voltage as well so it's three different temperatures so once it's on you can click it three times repeatedly not five times because then you just get turn on or off you click it three times one after the other very quickly and it'll change color you see how it went red there that means that you are on the next temperature level and it goes all the way up to four point one volts which is really pretty powerful it starts down off down at three point six so you're gonna be able to match it properly with your cartridges you can cycle through these temperatures and like I said there is three of the temperatures and red is the highest temperature so that is gonna be the most intensity red is the International for hot most intense that'll make it really easy to remember for you and then when you're done using the unit just click it five times and you're gonna see all the different colors around the LED it's gonna blink three times and then the unit is just gonna shut off and then it's safe for storage this isn't a high-gloss black it is a very high-quality stainless steel battery and we definitely think that if you're gonna have a simple battery that's just a stick battery very simple dependable functionality then this is the battery that you need to have so for this and several other cool items check us out on vape honey stay calm check out our social media Instagram page out official vape honey stick subscribe to this channel to get the latest

it's been a while it's been like a week or two I haven't uploaded a car video yet so I'm back I'm back at it again you know I'm saying back to chief and the reason for that was basically because I just wanted you know just it's good to take our tolerance a break every now and then like you know Express she was like wax and [ __ ] like that you know um your tolerance goes up very quick so you know you you know taking a week or two office you know that can be pretty good for you cuz then when you go back to it you know you don't need as much to get to where you want to be you know a couple couple blinkers and you're set for a couple hours so yeah well that's that and today I'm back at it again with one of these a supreme this is my first time ever trying this um I've heard that there's a lot of I've heard a lot of hyper on these um I don't know if they're real or not to be honest with y'all y'all let me know you know I'm just I just do these reviews you know I'm not saying that this is good I'm just doing a review this is honest you know I've never tried this before you know I've just heard a lot of hype around it and I don't know if it's good or not so y'all let me know so sativa picked up pineapple Express ninety-two percent THC CBD point zero 85% see that it actually has a batch number which I don't even know if that's legit I don't I don't know if there's an actual batch number I don't even know where I enter that in to see in pod 282 XY so yeah it's a full ground oh it's not in the box cuz I already took it out it came in like a tube it came in like a plastic tube you had to open the tube oven and the card had um the car was inside the tube but I already do the - boy I already have the card on my battery cuz I've already tried it out um I just got it today so I mean I've only taken like a probably about like ten posts out of it cause I wanted to read that CHC distillate or Pete medical use only you know all that stuff take it off the sake show a little ooh alright so here it is not gonna lie with you know it was really clean it's nice it's a nice gold it's a C so you can see to see so it has the holes um I like I like the white tip because I never I've never gone one with the white tip the ones that I usually get are the ones you know the metal ones like the gold one the silver one or the black plastic tip yeah those are usually the ones that I see not gonna lie with y'all this oil is very very very runny like that doesn't even look good I'll be honest with y'all it's it's it's way too runny it's clean it's not dark it's not like yeah it's not like shitty wax you know it's it's it's clear I'll tell you all that but it's look at that like that's way too [ __ ] running supreme or whoever's making these you gotta stop this [ __ ] up man you should is way too runny just way too runny yeah um well obviously I'm gonna try this out still I've already tried it um I'm gonna put on my battery and I'll be back with y'all ready to puff on alright got it back on the battery um I mean a lot of people this is obviously not made by supreme I know a supreme is the clothing brand I mean clearly this isn't made by supreme like supreme would not allow that like they would never I doubt they would ever make their actual own card so I mean this is clearly made by either people or like a company but I don't know why a company would still a supreme my quality take supreme user name I don't know why they just wouldn't make their own but I'm pretty sure this is made by somebody so um the batteries on and take a couple puffs for y'all um tell you about the taste and tell you about the high let's get it okay okay right off the bat you can taste the UM you could taste a pineapple a little bit Wow that's already hitting me already that wax is ready as [ __ ] man you take a good hit off of it you're gonna fill it you're gonna fill it it's just a TV so I'm already filling it in my head but um what was I gonna say um it the taste it has liked it has a little bit of hint of pineapple towards the end but honestly in the beginning it kind of just tastes like straight bud um terpenes barely mmm barely yeah there's not really tart beans in there I'll be honest barely there is a little bit but yeah there's not really a lot uh I like I like Turkey you know I like my flavors you know Mike hearts to be Turkey so if you really like Turks probably not the thing for you like I said very runny kind of like the Dinks tanks are super runny the exotics I know those are all fake I'm pretty sure this is fake to you I'm telling you I'm being honest I'm pretty sure this is fake and if you already know if I'm probably get a lot of comments saying fake fake fake trust me if it is fake I was right then I just do these reviews for y'all because at the end of the day it's just entertainment and I'm kind of letting y'all know like cuz somebody might see this and somebody might want to buy it that doesn't know that this is fate that doesn't know that this is extremely freaking runny that doesn't know that so now they can know so they can have second thoughts no honestly this was $35 for a full gram I would say just save you know spend the extra 20 and get you like a rope or something steep odd a plug-and-play pod you know something nice you know this you know there's so much better than this right here you know but I understand some people aren't in legal states and this is kind of like the best that they can get you know they can't get all the stickies plug in plays yeah so that's why they resort to stuff like this as for the hi I'm gonna be wrote you the height is nice it does have a nice high I would give it probably like an 8 out of 10 on the high it's real nice the Teva it's already I feel I feel good right now so uplifted I'm to go and take another hit then again my tolerance is kind of low right now so some people might have to take more than just one hit for me I wasn't like here anything another one I'm really a big fan of taking blinkers to be honest I just got kind of take it casual you're gonna take like three four second heads but yeah this is um yeah at the end you can taste the pineapple on dragon line I really like pineapple so you know I can taste that I can taste it so there is a little bit of Terps but I mean I've tried two other cards that are pineapple expressing yeah like it's just so flavorful like right off the bat this one it's like towards the end you don't really taste it right off the bat like the other ones the ones that like you know are really chirpy so on taste I would give it a 5 out of 10 turn five out of ten um the oil was nice it's clear just it's runny so it's really not that good I guess you would say um card is nice I like it cuz it's a t-cell so you're gonna get everything in here so I do like the card I like the white tip so it's nice and the coil is nice um cuz I did take a couple blinkers off this and I noticed that it doesn't taste burnt so the overall cart is pretty good so the person that did get this you know they actually actually you know got a good car because somebody would just give cars that are trash so yeah young y'all let me know if y'all want like a particular brand I can I can probably get it um I had just picked this up cuz I've like I've seen a bunch of videos on this and I've heard like the hyper on it so I saw this today and I was like you know what let me go ahead and buy that cuz you know I just wanted to try it will I buy this again no I will not I will not buy this again I'm gonna stick with my other stuff um you know like just like the West Coast cars I never tried those will I buy those again probably not I really just [ __ ] with likes Dizzy's brass knuckles heavy hitters the real ones so yeah but I will I will do a review on like exotics or Dinks but I'll only do one review I will never buy it again like I've never bought into danger before and every bond and exotic but I will buy one just for a video to do for y'all to educate y'all but will I buy it again just for my own pleasure no same thing with this I probably won't so I appreciate y'all like this video subscribe if you want some more common telling which I wanted and um yeah peace let me know what y'all smoking on to you man", "DFwXyUQWJY4": "hey guys back of the video so sorry about the noises I don't know if

Guadalajara so basically I went from Trinidad to Boston for a couple days with six inches of snow and now I'm here in Guadalajara Mexico for Don Julio kind of big change I did not expect bumpy dirt road going to this is this is what I expected the first step is a Nagappa hills so I'm now properly adorned for the agave because you have to have the right L people have had most of us when we think about tequila we say well I want to know where it is made and we think immediately in tequila time between y lahar importable yatta you will find the killer town that's 400 tequila started ok all the story now if you see what our Hara and you go the opposite way you'll go to the highlands that's where we are to rate the killer you can make it only in one part of Mexico now we're in the highlands of Jalisco and the first thing that you will find is this type of soil now all the plantations of Don Julio come from this region we do not own the land that's something that is important because we only own via gavest in so many uses it's just a lot heavier yeah so Enrique how often you come out to field Raylan so weak no no not really once a week how much a few job encompasses before the beam yes you've been harvested it amount yes how many new plants are you planning here and let the old pants but we can see the navigation arrived now this is May because we planted a bit between March to it to mate this year will be plant 1 million seven hundred it's not stopping there stretches its legit cancer although I'm sure they know anything finally here at the Don Julio distillery and we're gonna walk around you may not be able to hear because we've been given these things for us to hear so I don't know what the audio is going to be like but we'll see what I like - Don Julio they you know I was wearing those headphones things we're about to go and do the tour and they said no photos no video dangerous because of the vapors so from one moment I thought we weren't going to be able to actually shoot anything indefinitely but I got the okay and we were able to shoot what you're about to see the problem though is you can't really hear very much it's a very loud kind of distillery lots going on so I'm gonna help kind of describe what you're seeing while you're seeing it so you kind of have an idea of what's going on basically the process for Don Julio is this they have agave plant which they cut in the fields these are called pi\u00f1as and these pi\u00f1as are loaded up onto these trucks each person cuts about like maybe 100 150 of these pi\u00f1as a day and they're brought to the distillery so you have this big mountain opinions of a distillery and it's crazy it's something really pretty exceptional to see all these pi\u00f1as so the pi\u00f1as are all sort of different sizes and so they have to basically cut them up into sort of similar sizes before they put them into these autoclaves so there and they get cut up over there and then if you look kind of over there those are the autoclaves so it's cooking cooking the agave back there it's actually quite cool the actual Gavi itself doesn't taste very sweet so it's kind of like a potato they cook the pi\u00f1as and when they cook those pi\u00f1as the transformation really takes place and they go from this you know white sort of starchy substance to a brown very lush very sweet in the center of the Pina is the heart and you can actually eat it sort of like a sweet potato and the outsides are these fibers and the fibers you can kind of chew on and out comes this wonderful nectar to get that nectar they basically shred the agave plant they know they crush and shred and that extracts all of that agave out of it out of that sweet agave it's quite impressive I didn't realize kind of like how much volume they get from all these peanuts so they take that agave water and they ferment it they add yeast and it sits in these tanks and ferments it makes sort of like a beer an agave beer I'd say I'd say that's considerably hot much much hotter than a lot of all the flavors are on our produce here okay the rest of the process is quite very important but real inside we don't have we don't have another sugar we don't have more alcohol outside okay we must do it uncertificated so in the fermentation tank that was really hot yeah is that is that all natural heat from a more natural heat what happens there again as I answer that we have in one milliliter at the beginning 50 millions in one meter there's twenty four thousand liters Linna magic how many little bodies are there the things that your body is transformed energy from the food and then your body increase half a degree or one degree when during okay in order to start to process here happens the same billions and billions and billions take half a degree of temperature more but we don't really know what to produce that energy that you felt very much like scotch or bourbon you've got you know this is fermented matter which then they distill it is still twice and they make their head cuts which is the elements in the tequila that you really don't want to drink gives you the hangover and makes you sick and then the tail part which are kind of the heavy fatty things that kind of way down the tequila so the clean part of the tequila really is in the center and in the distillery there are a ton of stills you've got kind of two row you've got like ten I think it's like 12 total stills and one special still that they use for the 1942 and the reality you know that's the fundamentals they're really you know the basic thing it's Pina which is seven years about to grow harvested cut up putting the autoclaves shredded fermented distilled and then either left to set to become the Blanco or aged for one of their older products it's a really straightforward process but still really quite fascinating now when you're in the Don Julio tequila plant you know you smell both that fresh agave being cut up the the cooked agave with that vivid syrupy smell and then the distillation that tequila and those three smells is kind of come together and you can really pick that out in the glass it's really it's really quite exceptional thanks for watching the the Don Julio tour go ahead and like this video which is uh right down here and subscribe to our drinks Birds YouTube channel give us some comments tell us what you like we keep tailoring these videos because you're giving the comments and you're telling us what you want to watch I'm Jeff climbing with drink spirits thanks", "B3AP7M_FNWo": "anime fans one piece fans what is good the answer that question of course is one piece one pieces what's good and today we got this one piece chapter 963 fire well I don't know if it's fire I didn't really hear any rumors on discord and what not I don't know if this chapter is supposed to be good if it's supposed to be mid like I don't know but you know we just out here chillin so let's get into this one piece chapter 963 Wow so it's just but I can't believe 963 chapters at around this time next year I it's it's going to be 1000 chapters and that's just kinda surreal to me so yeah let's just get into the self we got the cover page of course beige on my family but germs pirate crew attacked the country while the king was away so I think they're still in dress rosa and these Germans pirates the captain just looks unhealthy he really does so their journey started on the back of an elephant long long ago centuries back we minx made a solemn vow with the Kisuke clan samurai voix know we are family so I think this does mean that the guys that washed up on the shore last chapter were members of the Kisuke not Kisuke they were minks like I'm pretty sure they were Inu and Necco like people didn't that wasn't confirmed but it just looked to me like they were Inu and that goes so you know I'm just gonna go with that so we are family we promised that we would always assist one another one faced with hardships okay yes definitely inner actually nekima mushi you can just see by their backs like the ears like it's obviously them and they were obviously the ones who washed up on the shore so yeah those were definitely them so we don't know when that time will come but we so then they're just like one no huh I'd love to see the outside world yeah I can real same yeah it's like a cat like yeah it's hard to say so like hey where can we find this land I heard there was a bunch of different ones that's right there are more than five islands in the world there are that many I'm hungry yeah so you can just see you know neckla they kind of wanted to go on an adventure I guess so as kids they wanted to go find one oh and they sell there and then they're pretty sheltered so they're surprised that there's more than five islands in the world so then something happened I can't see all right they got destroyed by a wave their boat got wrecked by the ocean and then Knuckles like the world is horrible 100 is horrible because we know that one oh it's pretty protected by the weather definitely so then wait a minute oh oh I see so that's not they got washed up on wha Oh No and now we see that they're tied to a stake and are apparently about to get lynched by townspeople from ah no because you see that there is neck oh and you knew and then there's also called Matsu because in the last chapter I believe we saw Carl Matsu over them mm-hmm so it's just like three strange creatures and then the people of wanna of course hate them kind of like fishermen all over again but now that goes like we shouldn't have come here he was like doggone we should never have gone out to see our family Yeah right a cat monster a dog monster in the coppa is this Beach cursed burn them at the stake and then there we hear they're just all upsetting they're like aah and then Odin is in the ocean and he's like phew now I have enough ingredients to make tonight's Odin huh and then he sees the column Otsu in our Rashi nekima mushi crying and then he sees the townspeople laughing or just the samurais in general and Odin is like you should be ashamed to be afraid of those who look different only high night highlights your ignorance how dare you bully a bunch of kids disgraceful and he just beat them all up and then Odin is like now then farewell and then they're like you're leaving us like this he just left him tied up and then this is that curry curry castle what why did you bring these monsters here sir Odin they followed me thank you for helping us back there so it's like coming tribe in Araji main tribe nekima mushi like you already knew that but you know one piece always got to do that that introductions you know what I'm saying so they're like Huff yeah we were already starving but then we were almost beaten to death this is so hard there's no I can eat it this is hard to believe they really are talking animals that's Kinnaman and then oh and it's like the Ming tribe my father mentioned it to me yeah I bet he did an instruction in our country mentions our bond to your family and now you're our Savior as well still I may be hungry but this is way too our and then he's just like oh he just tosses it and then in a rush it's like stop that nekima mushi and then he's like I have cat's tongue wah ha ha hey cat Odin would not be Odin if it's not boiled and eaten hot and then Karl Marx is like this is yummy and what are you meant to be my mother and I drifted to this country after our ship sank when we asked for help people threw stones at us because we were fishermen my mother was injured so we were unable to return home ok so Karl Marx who is a fish man that's kind of surprising because when he was introduced like people are like is he a fisherman but it was kind of insinuated he was something different in not a fisherman but apparently Korematsu is indeed a fisherman so I was kind of wondering if it was gonna be a honing race but you know Fishman is cool like you know we love fishermen out here we really do so he's like with her dying breath my mother told me fishermen are always discriminated against in this world he would be more likely to survive if he claimed to be a Kappa so now I'm calling matzah takapa live off of leftovers others throw away oh I see so he was a fisherman and then he was his mom told him to claim to be a copper because he knows she knows that the people of Juana are superstitious and would be more likely to I guess accept him you know what I'm saying so I am so grateful not only did you save me but you fed me delicious food too I will never forget what you did for me today and then neck and when we she's like oh I forgot my manners I wished all that food you know uh she's like now you're acting like an adult and he's like I'm sorry Kappa I'll help you finish it and he's like it's still hot and then Odin is like ha ha what an interesting cat and then uh you know Rosh is like a cat and then Odin it's like meeting you guys has made me realize that there are many creatures them this world I have yet to see now I am really excited for my next voyage take care and then he's like take care and then all of them jump on him and they're like no let us stay here you didn't even ask us they're just dogpiling him and then they're like this group keeps getting bigger well considering their strength it should be fine but we are running low on funds you let more money to that fellow Orochi right why do you keep doing that oh well even though he is on his own now he used to work for Yasui so I cannot just leave him to die huh so I that's right because I wrote she stole the money I guess he got booted but you know I don't know I wrote cheese justice he's kind of a snake you know well we already knew that but I don't know gifting money to her wrote she's a bad idea out and just a bad idea so tiptoe slow and steady this is the essence of walking like a ninja we can do this jazz tui is no big deal so you got Kinnaman Rizzo and kanjar-ro doing something Haku my why were you trying to steal so much money because they're old and needed money if you are going to execute us then get it over with already you Hedgehog that dang old and he sure recruited some odd characters I will give you the money you tried to steal they're like huh so all the nine scabbards right because he was giving money to Orochi they all try to his steal money from Yasui and then they're like what wait Lord yeah sweet if you did that how come my home run out of and on top of that and then the gas was like in on top of that take this - he's a wisely even more are you being serious is something wrong with you is this some sort of trap and then Yost was like do you love Odin and then he's like if you do then use this money to dress properly and then they're like ah this these do not suit us at all so they're just all in classy clothes now and then hmm and then I can't tell you what that is I think that's Kiku he's like Setia and kind of months like learned something in manners wrong it has to come from the gut like this Sasha so Sarah is a term that samurais used to address themselves according to the description in the box below buy some books and bow yourself with knowledge and wisdom so this is just yes we over voicing them he's told them to learn manners by books and he's like if hoodlums like you were able to become the retainers of Odin as you are right now you would bring shame to his name and then took like Lord Odin dbiddy good morning this deep-fried tofu was simply exquisite and then Odin's like why are you lot suddenly acting so strangely it's so creepy and then Yahoo is like he will one day be the Shogun Juan oh and the people who will support him through it all must be the best samurai in the entire country so you can see them training a servant's duty is to protect their master all of you must make yourselves the Capitol's no the entire country's guardians and they're just training like crazy so it says three years later thirty years from the present the flower capital I heard that the daimyo of curry and his followers will be visiting the capital wah ha ha be sure to hide your money to avoid getting robbed Lord Odin and his retainers are thugs after all wait there's mr. mountain mountain Junior get in the crate oink-oink so I think this is a young Mountain God or something look the party from curry has arrived oh my what are they his samurai we're Odin's retainers always so dignified and they're just kind of confused they're like my eyes must be deceiving me it almost looks like the Cho Shogun's profession so I'm like now that I've seen General Order I am basically certain that dentro is Koshiro like I don't see how he wouldn't be kosher oh he's like God to be cultural you know what I'm saying he just looks like kosher Oh then you got YZ o and YZ o has a sword so I guess he was a swordsman I wonder why he would switch the guns then the majestic and dignified appearance of the same are I their commanding presence could take your breath away the onlookers were in such awe that many had even dropped down to their knees if I have become a fine man it is thanks to you but I am Not sure I have changed one bit I cannot believe you are thanking me why do you look so outraged so Odin is talking to his father I believe I can't quite see who that is but I think he's talking to his dad and then Odin came to visit after hearing his father taken ill but after seeing his father's energy his worries disappeared however that was the last time the two would ever speak so you see a roadie there I'm figuring that Orochi was probably one of the king's attendant he probably found a poison him that same year poor Itachi okay you know I had to say this it's called poor Itachi so you know I had to say this rest in peace Itachi okay let's switch back to the only whoa else didn't say let's switch back to the right anime but I just finished saw white beard up in the air oh let's get on with this chapter we find the waterfall didn't we so why is there a sea in an island up here I can sense that there's other humans nearby pops it'll take a fit week to finish the repairs the cargo hold is flooded so our provisions aren't good as gone we need to head out to find supplies any volunteers basically everyone we're tired of sitting around I'll go - yo I know you're just an apprentice oh so we see young white beard and Markos like I'll go too and he's like you're just an apprentice so Marco has gone from being an apprentice to the right-hand man a white beard in just 30 years that's impressive so we see Vee stuff we see Jo soo Jung [ __ ] ooh and we see a guy I don't recognize he's probably the former second commander so Captain tough the white papyrus Edward Newgate Lord Odin went to the coast why did he let him go we must stop him I heard that a pirate ship was spotted at port Itachi they apparently looked different from other pirates their ship is supposed to be huge - they must be pretty strong this is terrible he must have gone to chase them off if that's the case it might not be so bad hey all of you stand back huh white bridge said that to his guys and then he's like something's coming something incredible so this is the pirate ship congratulations on making it here you must have traversed all that terrible weather and waterfall I have been waiting for you and white birds like this doesn't look good and then Odin jumps out white beard wait yeah Jody jumps out white beard and then they clash Ivan Odin's like ha ha ha my name is Kisuke Odin I want you to let me and we may not know each other but I want me to let you I'm sorry I'm just tripping up for my words my name is Odin Kazuki we may not know each other but I want you to let me join their crew whoa so that was a good ending to the chapter good ending to the flashback because I was tripping over my world just this whole time but sorry I had a bad night of sleep last night so I don't know I'm just a bit out of the loop but so just white beard and Odin be clashing like that they're just like boom it wasn't quite a yong-chol clash you could see cuz like the skies didn't split so Odin wasn't yonkoma at least at the time or if they clashed in an epic manner that is one great drawing a great scene and then he just immediately asks him to join his crew so good chapter the chapter I didn't find it as engaging as other chapters have been but the ending with the clash with white beard that was cool and it was cool to see that Markel was an apprentice 30 years ago so my channel's namesake has went from being apprentice to right hand and strongest member in the wipe your pirates and just 30 years now this guy with the giant chain of mace I'm not sure if we've seen him before if we have it he might be the second the former second commander that disappeared but you know that stuff will be cleared up in the next chapter so yeah thanks for watching if in from our content and only fiend drama constant like this video subscribe and turn on notifications for more one piece content I can't wait for the next chapter can't wait to see how this ode and flashback progresses and I will see you in the next video", "SuPcLktNJEY": "[Music] okay so we're gonna go ahead and get into this look as you can tell I do have my body on nothing on my face besides a little bit of moisturizer I did decide in this video to use my precisely my brow pencil by Benefit Cosmetics and of course I do have a little bit of my NYX eyeshadow base as you can see here I am just brushing out bluffing my eyelashes and now I am going into my zaharan palette by jeebies place I do not know the colors but I will make sure that I list all that below the shape that I use which is kind of like this light tan shade I pretty much use that of course as my transition shade it's pretty much kind of just sit the NYX eyeshadow base in my crease now as you can see here I am using the shade Brown out of the box of crayons palette and I am just using that to yeah dark in the outer V [Music] [Music] now I'm going into that shape pouts han out of the box of crayons palette and I am placing that pretty much all over my lid so now it is time to add just a little bit of pop of color to this neutral look going back into the Julius place palette using that reddish on shade that is so pretty I just had to use it and I am placing that on the inner part of my ledger just add in just enough you don't want to see you take over the whole lid and of course right next to it I did go in with that go this shade just to make it pop a little bit more so as you can tell I kept my eyes really really simple so let's go ahead and get into [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so now we're going to go ahead and finish up this look I'm going in with my Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on Council eyeliner pencil I have it in a color chaos because is real pretty balloon [Music] now I'm going back into my Julius plays song palette in that color snow pretty like deep reddish orange shade I'm called Jamila I'm gonna drag the head right under that blue I'm just gonna go in with a dark brown out of my north 335 no 39 egg salad just to add a little bit of death [Music] okay so I realized that this video was going really really longer than expected so I went ahead and I finished my face with the normal stuff that I been using lately and most of my videos so the highlight of choice is my uncle Olaf from crayon case you know I love for my lips I use my hyouta Beauty lip contour set this is gonna color trendsetter and bombshell which of course it just has the lip modern the matte lipstick and then the liquid lipstick go ahead and set my face using my Jawara cosmetics so to finish this look off I did actually get a drawstring ponytail from my local Beauty Supply it is the ultra timeless couple on its own the salad whoops I got it in the style called salty which I feel like it's perfect I've never really done up dude so I took my buddy Rob and I had my hair in the tightest so this is how the John strain looks and I mean if they're familiar with the drawstring you should you know how it goes got it in the color one supporters this is how it is the part right here when you put your puff but your ponytail in has a clip in the front a clip in the back and of course obviously know the back is where the tag is and the front part has this extra little piece which is the bang part and it has a clip right here and that's gonna be what's gonna hang in my face so let's go ahead and put this on style this to see how this looks [Music] so let me trim this a little bit and I will be right back okay so this is the finished look I did trim it up I may trim it up a little bit more and I also put kind of like bobby pins on the side just to give it a little bit more definition when it transitions into the bank but yeah this is definitely a really cute hair piece you can put this on and it look like you just walked out of the beats tonight so yeah this is the entire look of me doing my basic - of course a soft lamb look let me know what you guys think is she cute thank you guys for tuning in and watching this entire video if you have not subscribed what are you waiting on really well you might not make sure that you

[Music]", "G1EvpvhdbtA": "anime fans one piece and what's good answer that question of course is one piece one piece is what's good today we have another live stream with our friend vulture Valley you be sure to subscribe to his channel link is in the description so today's topic is on my man sup how strong is up I think this top is stronger so most people think I think if so unlike even Charlotte oven pull it up on you stop and tried to blitz him or something like that I think we saw that see what actually they're pretty well against its own like oven or someone like that should go and be easily be able to escape them if he plays his cards great even possibly win since optical smart but well sure it's a gift you will let him go for okay I guess I'm arguing the opposite yeah I really don't believe that Gustav has has a defensive capabilities to like physically I haven't seen I we've seen that he's gotten stronger per se like being able to use bigger attacks and offensive capabilities and he's more of a toolbox utility type of guy he can fix problems that aren't necessarily combat related like fixing the Sonny in case Frankie's gone or building some kind of random machine that they need you know whatever at the time like mommy's climb attack that's not like low leveled stuff that's actually pretty impressive and he integrated with the dials that's more his speed but if someone would like someone like Sanji knew he had to kind of move as fast as he did when he went against oven when sandy was on hole caking at a speed blitz oven that's when I that's what I see coming from the top through people if there was a those are long drawn-out fight and Ivan actually saw Sanji I think it would be like a mid diff for Sanji and anything that's mid difference on G is extreme diff Russa this is how I see and is it goes case-by-case of course because one piece is about matchups but generally anyone with hockey it's one if one did they have one of the hockey he's gonna have a hard time if they have both it's gonna be tied if and if they have a devil fruit on top of that like Sabu he I don't see him coming out of that at all you know without his big plot on there cuz because he is a star hit well first of all this wasn't going to bring up I think this I think just might seem a little bit wings but in first of all you just will get without proton to get the man is ripped just being honest he's ripped because he was on the Isle fellas savage plant so he has really had to use them but its physical capabilities are actually pretty large compared to what he was from time skips as he has been running around the boy archipelago like he's Robin Hood yeah but at the same time you gotta think about a muscle mass and one piece Luffy was pushing buildings apart and he had the most stick for your arms when he won in the series he knew sob had the same exact build but Luffy was doing all the crazy stuff you probably even not I'm gonna say even before dumb fruit but we know that Luffy whole stuff back until like a big challenge comes so you know he was you know as strong as he was pretty much throughout post time skip from the beginning you know he grew after Rob Lucci and all those fights but the base strength it was crazy so Muslim ash doesn't have that much to do with it when it comes it's just that he looks cooler now and he's more confident and of course you got better but when you start from zero and you go up to 50 that's impressive but if everyone else is all 500 that's not it doesn't matter you know yeah very scheme of things observation haki seems to mean more it's not it doesn't seem to be as much of dodging and more of fencing the reason I brought up his muscle mass was I feel like that was his way of life physically showing in the drawing but you thought it's just faster and stronger now physically and along with observation haki I feel like even if it's not trained he's since he awakened it like Kobe it's going to be really strong and he's gonna be and right I don't think he realizes yet I think he's able of course to the best speculation is headcanon on my part but I think it was something to be able to dodge a lot of more things than he or we realize and so now you think he's so do you think this up has so right now like he basically flashed up like you know higher two characters do you think that's in his repertoire because if not then we have to seriously kind of like nerf him or curve our expectations because if he doesn't have sober and we really haven't seen anything about that we've more seen him do that thing really did when he swam all the way to Amazon Lilly and he sensed every creature on the island their power level ICU you saw being more in that vein than having you know the observation to or the the observation and the means to dodge high-level high-speed attacks I just don't see Matt I don't think that's this thing I think him and people him and I what's that Vaughn auger on the blackberry pirates I think I think they're gonna you know be doing that whole sniping from Islands thing that's gonna be his fight not close close range yeah and that that that's a skill and that's highly value but when you rank people for how strong they are you have to have to include close quarters combat and house you know I may be able to last and if we just look at that we could put them high for sniper skills because he's probably one of the best snipers in the verse but that's only gonna get you so far you know right but I think you supplement of having both sides because if you just look up beams weapon just be blunt if specialty has always been running away when he brewing thank you even dodging when he's in a bad situation he's able to evade you've always been a put that vain not always because if not alabaster he got messed up using a body cast for many I think he could meet up a lot you know cuz he had his nose broke that the whole body Castle what he got here with like a thousand pound hammer or some crazy like that or a bet yeah but hmm what you're saying is a fair point I don't think he's that unable to God but I think I still think he'd because for some people like Musante well those people are in that fastest on right not gonna be with a vein so I'm like Sanji for a long time but you can just some more lowers cop series like he doesn't look at offensive ability what I also really want to talk about what's his offensive ability even though he's long range like when he's in short range it's not like he sent people to duke it out with throwing like oven like he is able to keep able to snap off shots really quick me yes because of course the pro sure they are to you the easier they are to hit hey so part of this upright is his tactic was he's at disadvantage he uses tactic but he's been missing that before so if he's getting lit by throwing like oven and I do believe even their safeguard go aren't as impressive as I would have thought I still think I still think you'd be able to dog doesn't threaten me with a wild weed yeah I don't think well other than I think is slower I don't think this thing is speed so maybe oven and like nozzle speed based characters yeah so even if it goes to say for sake of the present King George oven or maybe 30 seconds or not even 30 dictate 10 seconds 5 seconds before other than cactuses oh is that code and what's up his goose top is able just rolling up ammo and snap off a shot and if you use its impact wolf remember that giant wolfy shot yeah that did that whole shock wave the reason that pricked him so long to you that was one for the height kind of he was aiming if I was right there and he just snap that off that's gonna send oven flying the other direction you know what I'm saying yeah able to snap it off but does the does the actual wolf shoot that fast as well we got to look at because remember it like it has to unfurl and that whole thing has to come out I did just instantly hit and then became a thing you know say say it wasn't even impactful because I feel like he's got to have some more interesting family like I just think his regular like little pellets if he was able to somehow like not put hockey on herself like maybe he has a smallest amount of army hockey that he can control but he knows how to do it like the Kuja do and like infuse his little pachinko with it I think I'll be able to you know be a good offensive with him as long as you know don't think that I would say holding him back from being like top tier and being able to even do that in the first place it's this physical ability like like we discussed before I can't hear you so can he do gear to level speed because most people that we can sort of strong have that you know I can do a little flash real quick and be fast as Lucia do you feel too but hey uh I can't we can't really make judgments on this physical abilities because um so for now I'm gonna say this second physical abilities are not up to par he's so fit enough so we say blue so say he's like say it oven or daifuku jeans or something like that but he's got if he's gonna dodge it and if he's able to snap off a foot ammo that repel for even like a little bit knock them back light can't be that he's instantly at the advantage because a they're farther who can use bigger and badder ammo and even if he can't be as their actor occupied for even just one second or a 0.5 seconds since Musab has been trained in sniper abilities he's going to able be able to snap off more ammo and and the more and once he I feel like once he gets them at that range he's gonna start he's gonna be able to bombard them but show they're far enough away or even maybe he only need 10 feet be something like impact smoke and one uses impact rope you might even be able to use something bigger than impact wolf you know impact offers the biggest thing we're seeing that's amusing but I feel like he's gonna be able to he's gonna be able to hold people off and even be able to combine them and destroy them with mr. bombardment I'm not saying he's the beat oven or daifuku necessarily but I'm saying she's gonna be with a defeat opponent to where he I'm saying he's stronger than we think and he's able to take on stronger opponents than we think he can take on most people seem to think so most people seem to think he can't even take on someone like Gladius or maybe not Gladius but they don't even think he can take on someone like say I don't even think you can pick on someone like Bartolomeo that won't be hard for anybody but if we was look at it like say you know do you have to look at the ranking system for the most like recent Yago we've taken off so we have daifuku of in cata curry cracker and smoothie and then we got you know jack and dim boys over in Cairo's crew so who's like like what level is oven and daifuku oh well we know they're weaker than third commanders there was like right under third commanders like they're the executives or the veterans I think they were called in the show so I don't know if what's-his-name I don't know if Gustav is necessarily dead low because I think if he can tangle with them that's cool he can probably get some hits in them the only thing that's lacking is his defense if I want to get a clean fire hit off a horse up I don't think he's dying but he doesn't know the tenkai like the iron body thing of off of one of those six powers that you know the suit of cp0 people use he doesn't have that he doesn't have actual body armor hockey and we definitely came to say you know he if he can't go full body if he can't even put up like his his forearms with it then there's a there's a lot of things that could possibly mortally wound us up and no matter how you look at how strong he's gotten weird we we can't say if he can tank these high level of people like a tax because signs you didn't even want to fight you know even like he if if son she was strong enough I'm sure he would have tried to take out of him you know at that point massage he didn't even feel confident that he can take out of in in a timely manner and he knew if I've been hit him it was gonna be a problem so we had to speed blitz him loose up isn't speed blessing him and he and if Sanji can't overpower Musab can't overpower him so I think he's like below whatever whoever's below oven and I fuku that's more true stops range and that's not necessarily weak because I mean yonkos crew even though veterans like right none of the commander's they're pretty strong my I think we all can agree with that so I would put him like so oven enough who had to be Mike his big mom than the three so they would be like what fifth and sixth and the crew and that's that's kinda where who's up it is like I don't see Nami Robin or chopper being really stronger and more useful than who's up so he's basically behind Brooke to me Frankie is up there to like he's pretty much fighting Frankie for like best best person like like fifth or sixth best person and then in Brookes in front of them I think Frank you stronger in the breath but that's what like a very different guy what what's his name is way older Lee Brooke is way older it has more experience I know Frankie did speed blitz anybody and he and you got to realize that Frankie Frankie's got strong armor and he's got Vega punk reason yes big monster that's offensive like we gotta remember the defense the defense is what's not it's metal like it's like technology metal it's not the heat is a special metal but you know like like you get a technology for his offense from the bigger Punk but he didn't get any new people laughing general Frank no always not you get about that yeah hold on yeah I forgot about you know Frankie but that's basically past the feast of love like it's just the strides pacifist ax and look how strong they were post times good if you think about it like ladies general Frankie like well I think he can be the pacifistic Ozora and sons you did it earlier but I think they got an upgrade but it wouldn't be a lo different Frankie like I think you would generally have a hard time with a pacifist if you think you can be okay or Akuma do you think you didn't like kuma himself cool mind though is stronger than doflamingo that is a lie so far we have to like get the world in a scope of power first so we got to iron out what we think is strong like you're obviously confused because Kuma's nowhere nation strong to do information without hockey doesn't mind anymore I mean like Sakuma that was that I mean Akuma that was that the bodies Akuma that was at thriller bark fat kuma was that kuma I'm not even gonna argue with you about this most we won't believe this but coolest part pads are at least as strong as year for pumpkins like I don't even I don't know I'm not saying he's weak it's just your when you bring up cumin most people who kind of do off now because yeah does my replace I'm going off you know the Combe that exist right now and Roma no it was not right Oh God but the one with the mind maybe because we don't know how many hockey's he's had we can say that he had armament and observation but can we say he's mastered them and you know how fast is he he's he can teleport instantaneously but when you have someone that has we've seen people be able to keep up with light speed so it's almost the same thing teleporting light speed so observation is not gonna be a problem we see how tough Delfy can be so of zorro it's taking all the pain that Lucy took over all that time and we know luffy's a tank so if Zorro can take that pain doflamingo can take that pain because he took organ damage so it's like I don't really see kuma overpowering doflamingo or outlasting him even though he does have a metal body Zoro cut through your body I don't think Sorrels cutting for doflamingo like that so it's like we've see we've seen the cap of their powers before with the pain to my to my injected Lucy's painting bizarre that was not the ping that was not the pain of his like of course it all must be paying over a lot in time yeah it was all the pain Lucy had through all out through the birds and that's a lot he he fought wars he had hundreds of different souls put inside him and duro had pain already so you're taking your pain and his fan so that's you know Matt and if those the bees dovie's abuse come on was basically able to one shot the entirety of thriller Martin and ok one more is exactly there was a primitive three time skip Luffy and it was like he'd beat over bunch of three times good doflamingo almost load if luffy if it wasn't for law and his gammon I have already ha I mean his powerbomb that power bond that can give a shot takes too long that's a 10 minutes you think dopamine goes in there and look at you while you do that inferred that Ursus claw at marineford took like but it was it wasn't as strong and then when he did throw the bark wasn't even like as strongest things we've seen before like it was a big bomb but like I'm pretty sure doflamingo with his awakened can do almost as much damage as there's a shot in fact actually let me digress from kumo for a little moment yes so I can say this and when I say that you're gonna groan but okay I know lots of people think I'm wild but it raucous Moria was definitely found the doflamingo he was at least first mate yong-chol level first calculate level in my opinion that no one statement of it Oh silicon let's listen here first of all Lauria got body by Kaito in the New World yeah so of course people ignore this but all throughout the realm of art it was obvious that it got in the press to giving up and stopped training for the last what 20 years and not 20 oh sorry up for the last like many years Carrasco is touched I am here's the thing sometimes one piece of this it gives the statement and then it's hard to like Jakarta wrapping my head around the statement so people so people ignore the statement but this is the fact like fit can say some real quick it's really so you're telling me that doflamingo is stronger than the first mate of a cat crew because ya don't feel Oh dist Maurya emery's worth no I said prom laureate oh okay not and also prom doesn't so prom doe fee is lower than prom Moria yeah the reason I say this is because I know let's talk say but Moria was because remember Moria 50 I guess title is around 55 60 like this is a fact because of course Qaeda was around and boreal we saw more II was that moderate execution and was grinning so we know that was about when Moria set off Moria was thanking with Kaido and that it was indicated more than once the mangas said he thought kind of equally wit could have been a typo but basically watching enjoyable but but basically what I'm saying is cuz I know for leg it was Yong Chi though like I think utamaru was always kind of on the lead inside but do you remember shadow that guard shadows Asghar was impressive but freakin uh what you call it Lucy if nightmare pre timescale luffy can beat him and there's absolutely no way he's on first amanda level because any first commander is beating nightmare Lucy no I'll just remember um so we saw that Kakashi shadows one punch was destroying the ground a people we get trilobites for the word Burke was one of my favorite art Moria isn't my top ten favorite characters but I'm not biased uh but the shadows are cards he was trying not to barf the shadows the whole time he couldn't even control it like when he did it you could see he was kind of like she's kind of gold it was like obvious she was just trying to buy time for you see to get burned up by the Sun right he could not control it like you only through like two punches wait patiently waiting but we've seen first commanders have excellent near perfect control we've seen people crocodile had more control and he always say that's where you go well that's that's going on Thanks you got shadows right uh-huh and shadows and I got a clue but I was like [ __ ] up - you got shadows after right Laurie has been kind of cut to da grease we discontinued but be nothing and crying and probably getting drunk over his Rock screaming maybe and you need practice T and you need to stay touch he could not control the shadows at card but if you got this Moria who was supposed to up in custom with Kaito this crime warrior he wanted to be the Pirate King that was his reason I'm pretty sure shadow that card would not be in his arsenal if he was not able to control it at some point in time if Mori was able to control each other's Asgard I have today that exceeds a lot we kind of branch off the shadows Asgard is impressive but we've seen before like auras like in Internet Wars or junior and endures when you're big in one piece yeah it's impressive but only up to a certain level and I would say little wars junior it was a very prominent figure in the white beard crew and doflamingo took him almost instantly and it's like be you you can't be too big that that has been proven unless you can become like a full armament haki freaking giant like you would if you would have to have next-level army because you're too big you're not fast enough speed kills that's why cheese rule isn't one of the top people that's why you gotta no air walk sometimes and so rude definitely like you can't not be fast and it's big yeah and I leave Oreos to be like like even if he did lose his shadows I don't think he'll be able to do enough damage to lure to people like I think about dopey going up in its shadow dance card he would just put one of his legs off now I acted on it that so first of all Moria dad sorry I lost my train of thought but shadow glass guard I said he would be it was controllable if you just look at times bass card I'm pretty sure he would be with a clap or their little world here like just one punch that wasn't even didn't seem to be a punch to put much effort into you seriously and so I feel like remember kind of jaga formed out of back and forth blow and laundry as they come I feel like shadows Asgard would be more to deal with that like if he's but if try to convert him in full-on bagging forms just ask I don't see the best way to deal with that all right I feel like it's only the same I feel like titles form is only good because he has a miscibility Factory no one could cut his legs off or take advantage of his size because he's way too big I mean way to be invincible if he was big and not invincible he would be tough but he wouldn't be like impossible to kill like he is now that's why Moria is kind of vibe what I'm saying is um prime Moria if you saw Moria I don't know if he thought one season zero Wario was muscular and lean he was not fat he can be strong and remember da woman and he has complete control shop woman if he'd says Dunkleman and remember he has a sister sword indicating he used to be a swordsman if he um if he hasn't stopped man at you or he sends himself at you and he just switches them in an instant without a flaw and just flashes off your shadow and able to do things like that so that would be kind of thing because the same with Moria is he does not have to touch Kaido to kill him all he meets do it /title shadow he's got to spider shadow Kaito is dead no matter how invisibly dig yeah but that would never happen because gear for floofy is definitely faster than Moria even prime oh yeah I would I would say I really don't see Moria being Espino and there's no way that if luffy gets be blessed by Taito the more is miss cheevus what kind of I agree if his ability got off but you would need a lot of help and preparation and you need a way to slow Kaito down in order to make that a reality and I don't think anyone on I don't think anyone on Moyers crew or nor you could ever get to that point Appleman is instantaneous teleportations at one point I'm kind of that's what a speed bluesy is like like Kylie even if he switches it Moria isn't fast enough he might be the only saw this year old depressed on his but never trained and a blue moon Laurie I'm pleased that was I believe he was always lazy I think that's the motif of his character like he would have been better in the new world like he probably wouldn't even got beat in the new world if he was more motivated to go and do stuff like from the beat oh I don't think he was ever a motivated guy no he was deaf if you saw him at maybe watch episode zero I watched episode zero and yet he looked better and III really I really believe that he was stronger back then but everyone has a cap and I think Moria had a cap like he he definitely was our if we would just put him on a commander level I wouldn't give him first I'm sorry I would give him second at most third not even third after we see him when he gets depressed because his abilities are good but I'm telling you if we could find a way around it post time post depression Moria is is we couldn't post then three times get Luffy he he was awake after Luke and punched him like like Luffy did the nightmare Luffy and he punched him but more you were still awake after that so he's not a scrub he won't get taken out but he's not like as strong as you're putting him I would definitely say people underestimate him I think you're over you're giving them a little bit too much right now but you can't blame or forgetting defeated in the new world like if you cross sky though like even if you first mate level or whatever point you didn't run away like Lucifer got beat he got put in jail and he said i'ma try again but more you're right hold on I'm but no this is different cuz Moria got to be late but imagine if we didn't get speared imagine if every single straw-hat mommy's girl Brooke chocolate you stop robbing all of them all get slaughtered right in front of Lucy I'm not even serious even he would be motivated to just oh I'm just gonna get new nah c'mon start all over again I mean that kind of happened to him because remember he got um he didn't know what what happened to them he just saw them disappear so you could say Luffy thought all the straw has to bed and he trained and then someone told him they were better afterwards but there was a period with Lucy was depressed and he was saying he thought they were gone but he's still training so it's like you can't give Moria treats that his character doesn't have like he his case his character is to give up and and and that blocks him from unlocking all the potential that you're talking about like if you were to totally switch his character he'll be a whole new person he wouldn't be Moria so mauryas character is to be where he's at I don't think he'll be able to get stronger even at his peak he's second commander love who because of his mentality my he would have had conquer his hockey or did something and in blue because his will that's what makes you a king that's what makes Lucy special Luffy could be weak his fruits we're he's not that tall he's not that big but he just kept getting put into crazy situations and ouch and just strength through it all that's not Moria the difference between like a first commander and like regular pirates like more than a point but even going back you suck would you say I would I don't think this but would you say peace at Kosaku drop is about as strong as thriller darkman oh yeah I don't think they'd let Villa bark Moria a lot of things that went into maurya's character free time skip was definitely his utility I don't think who's up is at that level because he was bringing dead back to life and all that and that's like next-level stuff but who's up definitely had a huge like breakout year when it came to that stuff cuz I'm heat like you say have to join wolf so his area of effect is like on a crazy level compared to his little fire birds and a little pachinko balls from before but he doesn't have the area he doesn't have the area fake hockey is too much of a thing like people have said so many times if you don't have hockey in a new world your screw loose table is one of those rare people that's like squeezing by him Brook Frankie all them I don't think they have either loose op is the one that shows the most promise but if he doesn't get armament or at least get his officers to a point where it's like crazy then he's he's putting this self at risk especially when the crew gets do you know does her separation thing and they get separated and they have to fight on our own that's gonna be a big sticking point for him if he doesn't learn one of the hot keys to a point where he can defend himself cuz I feel like observation is for dodging and armament is of course for blocking and those are the two things you have to do Luffy fog auto curry when he couldn't block he dodged and if he didn't have that he would have been dead and Kyla curry wouldn't have had that respect for him to let him live you know and how well however have you perceived that fight if floofy didn't have the ability to use crazy observation and create night and okay armament he would have died and who Saab doesn't have any of that so this is another level you know so who would you put would you put when you compare it was any y'all go cool in new world just any crew or anybody I can think of you're gonna marine like anyone you think I would say this would be alright so you know how loose up and Lucy had that fight I think he I think that was basically I think that would be recreated again in new world if if who said worse to fight Kobe because Kobe doesn't have crazy observation haki he doesn't have crazy armament but it's enough to make him a threat but that's all he has but a new Saab has so much utility that he'll be able to counteract this so it'll be around that level like somebody that doesn't have too much strength because I don't think Kobe would would knock out loose often one hit and I think you sob could be the opposite sad day I felt like you about to say this but I really hope we win it because this one's I think conversation I think you're extremely under estimating Kobe did you see my how strong this Kobe's video you're you're assuming that I put Kobe low I just said that he'll be able to fight Kobe and I think that's a compliment - sup because he doesn't even have hockey so I'm putting that that's like a praise like Oh be strong he's gonna get stronger because he's had one of the fastest grows in one piece wanna hear something that could knock your dog well you see we are gonna think why do some what's something that's gonna make you scream and go 90 like and I read it I think Kobe hit Sanya give me or don't blink though bro you know like I'm saying that people are enjoy their opinions with sometimes is there there's just wrongness I'm sorry doesn't make any sense no it doesn't there's no I think if we only saw a Covey's observation on it was pretty strong we know the weekend event just remember he would Kobe was just able to sense the one princess on the one ship that they didn't even really know where it was Jessica tossed me so then how Michael was like how strong is your observation on me well here's the thing Kobe's I know some people want to say things like goofy Stephanie like the rock and Kobe is gonna be the same if your next Pirate King but even if toby is like this is like supporting rock that like GARP still beat the Rock will not spring carpet because we're stronger than Luffy but I'm saying Kobe Kobe is gonna be that you can just hear me out on this Kobe is gonna be the marine that it's gonna be biggest pain and I feel like Kobe is gonna have that's what I believe I'm not smoker I think it's gonna be Probie and I feel like Kobe thought just as much motivation as we see like Kobe's motivation to become an admiral except us we used to become the Pirate King so Kobe's gonna have to be keeping like I know and marineford he got wreck but then you see I like Kobe is a pretty big genius like when he awakened that observation it was really really strong so I feel like Kobe's gonna have to be keeping pace but like not keeping pace but like of course to be stronger than go swimming or gym a I feel like he Kobe's gonna always be a little ways behind you if he ever hopes to be an admiral that's going to be fighting Lucy's and the new world when you choose the Pirate King a boy or the Orion Co he's gonna have to be fairly close to me and I don't I don't see how Kobe's gonna only be strong its own like Peeta and even hope to eventually that's absolutely my coach and his copy has as much motivation as Lucy I feel like he came a long ways I agree what you said when you talk about Kobe and his growth but I don't believe he's strong as doflamingo those feats are more likely well I mean you could him you said both of them so I was just going off what you said but I mean if you want sake do something out I'm proud of you so we can just go off jimbe now Jim Bay would arguably be able to if one of the straw hats go down take the place of the monster trio easily so Sanji goes out Jim Bay would be a good replacement meaning he's there around the same strength place I believe Zorro and Sons you will be able to beat will be able to beat him what would be able to beat Jim Bay just kind of I feel like like basically he's the four strongest in the crew I believe Bruce top is the fifth to sixth strongest in the crew and only the only luffy is beating doflamingo in stride so I just want to get that out there I know I mean you were entitled to think that and I could see how I could see why like maybe you could put Zorro in there maybe even Sanji but I really did like that Dhokla Mingo just has too much tech for me a lot of people are kind of like looking at it stressed overall but I don't know fee went all out against you know luffy and gear for barely did the job but i put them on no one has enough strengthen let's try head crew to arrival maximum effort Luffy going full snake man cuz snake man you know it's faster than anyone else on the crew by leaps and bounds and I don't think you know Kobe could match that now I like I said I think he's all new sobs level and and and Kobe isn't I don't think Kobe could be doflamingo there's just no way he doesn't have like it took Lucy Kings hockey observation haki armament haki all in the next level because yet because he had Kings hockey and the devil fruit that's damn near awakened Musab doesn't have any of that Kobe doesn't have any of it I put some rocks I didn't mean not you underestimate the flamingos but not even the shore hat but like guys like they just other guys like I feel like you don't under this is the thing I know this like lots of people underestimate other people like they don't underestimate go flamingo but they don't realize that there are a lot of people that are on the mingoes level it's just none of the people you names like you said Kobe's on his level of course you took that bag and you you're saying Musab could beat some crazy people and djembe it's just I think your power scaling a lot of these people in a weird way and you're not like looking at like their overall usefulness and cuz cuz matchups mean a lot so even if Luffy even if Luffy be too narrow we all know why he beats now so it's not like he's on that level doflamingo doflamingo beat Luffy soundly because of his skill set in his base form but other people's base for him maybe do better against him like fujitora would do way better against uh against doflamingo his base form without awakening or doing his stuff Lucy did because of his gravity for like he doesn't fight with pure strength and like luffy didn't have enough strength and gear seconds I heard him and he was too slow in gear third but that doesn't apply to like fujitora or I'm not saying bottom is stronger but bartimeo because he has different like all if doflamingo didn't raise law no law like law would probably like locking one shot a lot of people who don't see him coming like he cuts him in half so it's all about matchups and I feel like Musab has a lot of tech if he just got at least a basic understanding of of combat observation in combat hockey he would be a nasty dude because he has a lot of different crazy abilities that he can use but Kobe all he has is his fists just like Luffy so he has a a narrower scope of people he could fight Luffy over Bob strength and dirt and durability Kobe doesn't have the durability of Luffy because he doesn't have the fruit and luffy's a monster got birth kobe doesn't have a special bloodline and plat armor to give him all that durability so that's why i'm separating him so much from people like luffy and doflamingo because we've seen monster level endurance and all that from them we haven't seen that from Kobe he got one shot by Luffy no one of note is getting one shot by Luffy like no one so that was three times skip but he could not have grown more than Luffy his girl like in order for him not to give him one shot by Luffy he would have to be on at least Sauron songzies level and I don't believe he is I believe he's on theodora's level in terms of durability overall overall cuz overall he can't cause damage like Zorro and he's not as fast as on day so you're not lag about speed well anyway Ghandi family's like well if I could Gail Kobe but like they stuff would he see and what he has unless he has a devil fruit or some common I'm not saying he has to but it is what I'm saying is in order to have the ability to face opponents to say he's strong like Zorro and Suns you can face a wide variety of enemies because of the overall strength like their strengths can cut through a lot of things like Zorro can cut through people with arm in hockey he can touch people with devil fruits he could do all this different create darkness uh sure but all Kobe has moving kinda fast and punching people so we look at Arsenal is not good enough to fight people like Paige would like these Arsenal fast and punching people and even look at Garf Garf Arsenal isn't right that's it remember what I said his hit they overwhelm people with their strength if your arm in hockey isn't comparable to my base punch like like Garth I mean Lucy punch Don chin Giles a little his head thing which means that he has strength somewhere on pre like prime good not prime guard but like young guard what he punched down chin Giles thing Luffy did the same thing and guard was able to punch a continent that's probably at full strength but at least Luffy had the strength to straight down chin Giles head and that's a big feat he was over to overwhelm their hockey I don't see Kobe overwhelming anyone's like he's been training for two years like for this his whole life oh yeah but Kobe like even looking like like goofy just over two years at leave nobody faced over two years doebelin stress and you're at a 20 you're just a 40 but if you double experience if you're a hundred you're 200 there's a difference Luffy had two bases for fighting combat and surviving by any means necessary he was sitting there getting punched with spiked knuckles as a little kid like you can't put them on the same level when luffy has been training for more than way more than to you that's why you can't put gar patlu fee on the same level cuz garbage been at this for so long yeah he's not his peak anymore but Pete GARP and Pete Luffy corner you can't see people volusia right now it's a wash yeah but we haven't but Coby going to quote unquote catch up to Russia my hair alright so what I believe is gonna happen is he gonna have to expound there's gonna be a point where he fights loosing one more time or he's gonna have some got heart-to-heart with guard or some kind of some kind of thing in the river II and he's gonna get the realization just like Lucy got the realization that he needs to get not only stronger but more versatile and work on his fighting technique so he's either gonna incorporate a weapon get get some of those six powers maybe you'll get a fruit but he asked he got more than what he has now he'll have to like he doubled his shrimp before he's gonna have the double in strength again that that's what I think his journey is like once he get like the same height as Luffy and he you know I'm saying get get he gets a real position and his disposition changes that's when I think he is so so maybe like a hundred or so fifty more chapter or something like that okay so back this up you put them on Kobe's level yeah well like this good no yeah yeah that's pretty good for how strong a syncope is where would I put probably I I feel like even going by of course must be few hundred million I can set I don't know there's not a lot of people I feel like these strength is completely known like Kobe mostly his strength in speculation but for someone who drinks is known I feel like probably at least what if the straw hat grand fleet captain like one of those guys like maybe I do get excited about that I think you would be I don't know who's consider strongest maybe hi Rudy nor Cavendish when he goes Hakuba tap evidence with Hakuba pink song do you think he's weaker than that you think Kobe's weaker than Hakuba Cavendish now so you think Kobe is the strongest one in the grand fleet if he joins yeah okay so you think so he would have to be faster than you know oh boy now we're not necessarily but he would have to make up for it in some way and when it comes to fighting all he has his speed and ability to punch hard so if he's not out speeding Cavendish I don't know how he's stronger than him you know yeah I think he's up Sweden Cavendish to be on this right that's a that's a bold claim and I like it I would have to I can't buy any oh okay I was weird um but yeah Oh Cavendish like I was saying that's kind of a lofty well well it appears as the founders just got help I don't know what can be about it so I guess you're just gonna end up ending the stream here it's been a good stream we share the subscribe to vote your values Channel and be honest I think I was kind of on the losing side in this stream there may be a part two but thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video", "tXszGNzpZmc": "[Music] hello chocolate is welcome back to my channel in today's video I'm going to be showing you guys how to transform your old jeans so I had this idea of making a crochet hem for no jeans that I had laying around in my house and it worked pretty well and I wanted to share that with you guys so I hope you guys enjoyed today's video and if you do make sure you give a massive thumbs up and also don't forget to subscribe so you can join the cuticle easy family so let's begin with the tutorial so this is how my jeans looks like before I cut it and create a Jean as you can see so I'm going to be measuring from here on my feet until where I want my edging to be so I'm going to be measuring from here and I want around 10 centimeters so you're just going to be measuring that and then right here you're going to be marking it down so you can just cut right here the first thing that I'm going to be doing is turning my jeans inside out I prefer doing my hands on the reverse so that's going to be up to you how you prefer that and what I'm going to be doing is just folding half an inch which is 1 centimeters and I'm just going to be adding tents all the way around so he helps me to do a very nice and straight to him so just make sure that it's nice and straight and then I'm just going to be repeating exactly the same to the other side so now I'm just going to be doing a very simple straight sewing just going all the way around so I just turned here on the right side so you guys can see the sewing and it's very tiny as you can see you're not going to be able to see this once we have the crochet edging here on the top so it's a very simple one so you can just go ahead and do the other side and then I'll be back and we're going to be starting doing the edging I'm going to be using a 2.5 millimetres hook is more pair of scissors in a measuring tape for my yarn I'm going to be using this one right here it's in the color white and it's a DK yarn and it's also 100% cotton if you guys want to buy this yarn right here I'm going to be linking down in the description below for you guys to check it out so I have one of the crochet hems already completed as you can see and this is basically how it looks like so this one is a pineapple stitch that I'm going to be show you guys in today's video and it's also going around the hem here of the jeans and this is how the other one looks like we're down to the crochet hem so now we are going to be doing the little markings just to make sure that we do the V's here right below the sewing as you can see just right below the sewing and you want to make sure that they also have the same space in between each of them so I'm going to be using my measuring tape and a pen this one is a red one so what you're going to be doing is placing the measuring tape just below here the sewing that you've created and then you're going to be choosing the space that you want in between each V so I decided to do one centimeters apart from each V so I'm going to be just putting a little dots right here where the first one is so 1 centimeters and then I'm going to go and then leaving that one centimeter space and then going to two and then three and then I'm just going to be basically marking where each one centimeters is okay and then following the measuring tape just to make sure that you have a straight line right here so all your visa basically straight on the bottom so this is how it looks like and then now we are going to be doing on the other side which is the back so now we are going to be starting crocheting so you're going to be creating a slipknot and then you're going to be choosing the dots so I decided to do on this one and then you're going to be pushing that down until it makes a little hole and it goes all the way to the other side and then you're going to be pulling the yarn from the back through the hole and then you're going to be yarning over both loops so now you're going to be chaining two so now you're going to go into the next dot so you're gonna get your hook and then you're gonna go into that dot and push it down until it goes to the other side and then bringing the yarn forward bringing all the way up and yarn over both together so both loops together and then you're going to be chaining two at the beginning it looks like that they not straight but they will be very nice and straight once you have created all of the V's around to the head so now go into the next one choose the dot push it down until it goes to the other side and then you're gonna be bringing the yarn forward bring it all the way up and then yarn over both loops in the hook so now I'm just going to be continuing all the way around following my dots and then I'll meet you guys when I'm here on the other side so when you get to the other side you just want to make sure that you change here and then you're going to be connecting to the other side so here in to the other V with a slip stitch so now we are going to be creating two rows with only squares so you're going to be chaining five so now we are going to be working with double crochets so you prepare for the double crochet and we are going to be working here on top of the V's so right on top you're gonna be inserting a hook grab the yarn pull all the way up and then yarn over the first two loops and the last two loops and then you're going to be chaining two following exactly the same just as we did below and then going into the next V and creating the double crochet so now you can just follow the same steps all the way around and then I'll meet you guys at the end so to finish this row you're going to be chaining two and then connecting to the other side with a slip stitch so now we are going to be following the same steps to create the next row so you're going to be chaining five and then you're going to be creating the double crochets on top of the double crochets chain two and then double crochet on top of the double crochet and then you're going to be repeating the same all the way around and then only you guys at the end and then at the end you're going to be chaining two and then connecting to the other side with a slip stitch so now we are going to go into the third row so you're going to be chain III and then in the very first square you're going to be creating a double crochet you're going to be chaining two and plus two double crochets so this is basically a shell stitch that we are going to be creating so now we are going to be chaining seven we are going to be skipping one two three squares on the fifth one on both double crochets right here on the first one we are going to be creating a single crochet and then you're going to be chaining to and then into the next double crochet here on the previous row you're going to be doing the other single crochet so now we are going to be chaining seven so now you're going to be skipping one two three on the fourth one you're going to be creating the next shell stitch so two double crochets chaining two and two more double crochets so now you're going to be chaining seven so now you're going to be skipping one two three on the full square on the double crochets right here you're going to be creating a single crochet on the first one chaining two and then on the next one another single crochet so now you guys can just go ahead and repeat the same pattern all the way around and then I'll meet you guys at the end so if you ended up like me as you can see I have seven squares in between each shell you're just going to be following the same pattern and you're going to be finishing off this row so you're going to be counting one two three on the full square single crochet on the first double crochet chain two and then single crochet into the next double crochet and then you're going to be chaining seven and then you're going to go into the very first shadow we've created and then you're going to be counting one two three into the third chain you're going to be connecting with a slip stitch so now for the next row we are going to be creating a slip stitch just in the middle of the shell so in the chain that we've created right here and on top of that we are going to be creating another shell so you're going to be chaining 3 double crochet chain in two and two more double crochets so now we are going to be chain III and then we are going to go here on the chain seven and we are going to be creating a single crochet and then you're going to be chain e6 and then you're gonna go into the chain seven and you're going to be creating a single crochet chain in three going into the next shell on top of that you're going to be creating another shell then you're going to be chain III so we are basically following the same steps as I showed you guys right here so chain three go into the chain seven right in the middle single crochet chain six go into the chain seven again right in the middle and single crochet chain three and then she'll on top of the next show so now you're just going to be repeating the same technique all the way around and then I'll meet you guys at the end so when you get here at the end you're just going to be chaining three and then connecting to the other side here on the very first shadow afraid it come to one two three and then slip stitch so this is basically will be our end into every in each row so now we are going to be starting with the pineapple stitch so you're going to be doing another shell here on top of this shell and we are going to be working with double crochets here on top of the chain six that we've created into the previous row and then we are going to be creating eleven double crochets going around here the chain so once you've done that you're gonna go into the next shell right on the top and then you're going to be creating the next shell without chaining so before we were chaining here three right in the middle right here after the shell so now we are gonna be skipping any Chinese and we're just going to be creating this little bigger shell right here on top of the chain six so now we are gonna go into the next one and then creating eleven double crochets going around the chain so now you're just going to be repeating the same all the way around and then I'll meet you guys at the end so when you get at the end you're not gonna be chaining you have here the very first shell that we've created and then here on the third chain you're going to be connecting with a slip stitch so now created the shell on top of the shell just start the row so right here we are going to be chaining to sand now we are going to be starting with the little increases right here so chain two and then right on the very very first stitch that you can find from this little bigger shell here the eleven double crochets right here you're going to be creating a single crochet and then you're going to be chain III skipping a stitch into the next one a single crochet chain III skipping a stitch into the next one a single crochet and then you're going to be doing that on top of the eleven double crochets and you should end up with five little loops right here on top of the 11 double crochets so now you're going to be chaining two and then creating the shell so now we are just going to be following the same as we've created into this part right here so you're going to be chaining two and then into the very first stitch here into these eleven double crochets right here we are going to be creating our first single crochet and then chain three skip a stitch into the next one in single crochet chain three skip a stitch into the next one a single crochet and then you're going to be doing that on top of the eleven double crochets so just make sure that you have five loops here on top of the eleven double crochets and then chain two and then create the shell on top of the show and now you're just going to be following the same steps all the way around so now to finish the row we are going to be chaining two and then connecting to the other side with a slip stitch so now shell on top of the shell so now we are going to be chaining three so now we are going to be working on top of the loops right here that we've created on top of the eleven double crochets so cheney three and then going into the very first loop and creating a single crochet chain III next loop single crochet and then the last one chain three next loop single crochet and then chain three and then shell on top of the next Shell so now you're going to be chaining three so we're following the same steps as before and then here into the first loop single crochet chain III next loop single crochet chain III last loop single crochet and then chain three and then she'll on top of shell so now this is what you're going to be doing for this row so you can go ahead and do that and then I'll meet you guys at the end so now to finish the row you're going to be chaining three and then connecting to the other

and greatest\nin herb vaping news and content. Now, this we have got another liquid vape to\nbring you guys. This is a 510 thread CCELL compatible cartridge vaporizer\nknown as the Hippie Nano. So the Hippie Vape, the crew that are coming\nout of America, they are also known for the Apollo X Air Vape, which is a super light\nsuper compact dry herb vaporizer. But this vape as I've mentioned is\ncompatible with 510 thread cartridges making it perfect for that US and\nCanadian leading market. So inside the kit we have the vaporizer itself, which is\nknown as the smallest vaporizer on the market, so they state that in this\ndescription themselves and this is like when you sort of compare this to other\nthe 510 thread vaporizers on the market, it's easily like half the size. So while\nthis pen is a little bit narrower, it's almost twice as long so this vaporizer is\nperfect for taking out on the go, using those 510 thread cartridges. So,\naside from to the CCELL cartridge that comes included with the kit, you\nget the vaporizer and this little micro USB charging cable in the base. So you\njust pop out this little cardboard tab here and it reveals that micro USB cable\nthere which can be used with any power bank or USB charging port and that just\nplugged directly into the back of the device. You can see that five\npin port there. So the Hippie Nano like most good CCELL vapes comes\nequipped with three different voltages starting on the green, clicking it up\nthree times gets it to red and blue, so obviously, if you're dealing with thicker\noils, you're gonna want to use the higher voltage, but most distillate that you're\ngonna pick up from the dispensary is going to just be fine to use on the green\nyou can get the most of those essential terpenes in with that. So basically if I was\ngoing to use this Hippie Nano just with a cartridge and just unscrew the CCELL\ncartridge that comes equipped. The CCELL obviously, the ceramic cell, put that side\nfor now. Here I've got a distillate cartridge to some Pineapple Express distillate\nthat I'm using with this Q-tip pen. Now the reason I love this Hippie Nano is\nthe way that it actually operates is different to the normal pen style.\nSo obviously, the pen, just hold down like this. This one I prefer like just hold more like a gun, a little bit like this. See if you got your finger\nsort of on the trigger and it's a lot more discreet if you're using it in\npublic, you can sort of disguise it in your hand and no one's really gonna see\nwhat you're up to. So obviously this one here, would just\ncrank up that voltage a little bit we can get a big cloud for the video.\nCharges very quickly, obviously I think about an hour this one from start to\nfinish it was flashing indicating that was ready to be used. It also has a\npreheat function, if you double click that button so this is the function\nbutton, I'll just do that now we'll see what kind of clouds this thing blows. It'll\njust flash red and to indicate that it's preheating and it has just changed\nits heating by turning to green indicating that was ready to toke. So\nall-in-all guys, a very simple device very discreet, very user-friendly. So\nanyone out those looking for a compatible 510 thread vape to use with\ntheir cartridges, check out the Hippie Nano!

82 kilo bottles per minute and the company sold 40 million bottles of ultra premium tequila in 2016 if you're into margaritas you're probably familiar with tequila but what a lot of people don't know is not all tequila is a hundred percent agave tequila we're here in Jalisco Mexico finding out what makes patron the real deal a bottle of patr\u00f3n silver costs $50 or $600 for a 12 bottle case while a top-shelf handmade crystal bottle of patron and lolli KCRA dose cost $7,500 these prices put patron in the super premium tequila category and despite the high price super premium tequila accounted for nearly 19% of all tequila sold in the US in 2016 if you go back 30 years the experience of drinking tequila was like macho situation of have a shot you can see now there's also people just sipping tequila and not only the shot thing but why is it cost so much for patron it comes down to its traditional handcrafted in small batch system the process begins with the agave plant agave is known for its leathery leaves that range in size from a few centimeters to eight feet Jimador is chopped agave into a round shape to reveal the heart of the plant called a Pina Wan Pina can produce around one case which is about twelve bottles of tequila patron receives roughly eight thousand pi\u00f1as from the agave fields each day patron began production at the jalisco distillery in 2002 and the recipe has remained the same we are using the most traditional methods why some people in the industry has been applying technology to the process the traditional method is the one that will give you much more of the agave into the glass patron makes several varieties of ultra premium tequila including silver Reposado and ano the distillery produces 30 times as much tequila compared to its first day of operation in 2002 more than 400 employees at a given time worked a cork seal and labeled each bottle by hand at least 60 hands touch each bottle then the bottles are carefully wrapped in patron signature green paper and boxed for shipment earlier this year Bacardi bought out patron valuing the tequila maker at five point 1 billion dollars both Shaun says the deal will not change the traditional way it makes its tequila the key decision that the company had was to respect the process of Francisco Harris or master distiller we have much much more equipment but it's always the same material the same size and the same kind of process that we have since day one [Music] you", "QC_XCWhEuAY": "hey whats up guys go ahead and colder here and I today I wanted to do an intro into my channel which is an intro for me too because I just started this today so I don't know I don't know how to edit or do anything so um I guess I'll be posting random videos like gym stuff you'll

a blue pineapple hmm and don't forget to almost fell comment anything so bye guys", "AZLbj5n01kE": "you live was poppin guys and my fans Wampus answer that question one piece one pieces was good okay yes we got that out of the way so we got one piece chapter 960 live reaction you know the weekly streams and all at that so uh let's just stop into this so 960 is called Kazuki Oden takes the stage and mm-hmm that's that's pretty good because I hope we actually get to see what olden looks like cuz I was talking to some of the boys on this cord and one of them said anyone wanna discuss the chapter with me and he de never discussed his chapters unless they at least remotely fired and yes you all know I'm talking about Zeebo we on earth us up okay so let's the end of this Kazuki Odin takes the stage ah so cover page still gain pages on my family the grand search for Lola first I thought those were all Karma's but no it's just people okay so let's get into this one piece greatness so okay so starting off the chapter I'm telling the truth I swear it I saw with my own two eyes the mountain was moving the mountain moved indeed we fled from it and ended up here it was even growling so I'm just gonna assume right away that they're talking about the numbers of onegai shima just right off the bat because if the mountains moving and rallying I don't know what else I could be but the numbers you know doesn't oh he saw what the numbers look like then maybe my theory about them being ancient Giants could be true you know what I'm saying so um let's get into this okay so through draw row Mountain Pass tea house poster girl okay so we got in character she said perhaps you encountered a mountain god the three of you seem quite chipper considering the circumstances huh the head nothing gets past you won't suru oh oh I think this is another flashback because this should be a flashback because they call her oh suru and she looking young right now I was thinking like Sousou dusty so this gotta be a flag back can you keep a secret for us the truth is we were finally able to capture an elusive creature it took us a whole year take a look at it wow what a beautiful boy skin is Snow White so it's Snow White so basically we got this weird-lookin pig up in here okay so if we take this little guy to the capital we can trade him in for one whole piece of gold and then I was like huh a piece of white gold Oh said a one whole piece of white gold and then those who was like a piece of white gold you could buy a giant mansion with that kind of money so we're kind of getting the look into the wah no currency because like one piece just the standard currency his belly but since wanna was the clothes country and it stand the reason they have a different type of currency that's just logical um so we got boss coral kama has been saying for years but he wants a rare white boar probably did this play outside the store he put a bounty on it but nobody's been able to capture until now that would be quite distasteful white boards are considered the heralds of gods ha ha ha cute story and all but this is just an exotic animal oh maybe it's supposed to be the herald of Cairo I bet I've done no sewers like hang on a moment is that oh dang my man is looking oh so soon was like hang on a moment and then she body slams kinam on it she's like did you just steal money from my wallet again kid Amman and he's like oh I'll stop at us through think of our childhood friendship so oh this definitely is a flashback now he's all blond and stuff what's happening Oh what what was happening I'm confused let me just respond to the chat real quick so let's just get back into this um I then like my big brosman have money issues and she's like your big bro z-- I bet they gambled their money away how many times have I loaned you money now I bet she's like if you ever touch my money again I will rip out your organs and sell them to reclaim your debt okay so basically just seems like Oh Sulu is Nami just wanna Nami except she kind of looks like Robyn more than on me cuz other Conda has two styles of drawn girls the Nami style in the robbing style so uh I guess she's just the robin style cuz like the robin styles he got all via robin monet and now apparently low suit and then she's like if you cannot afford to pay me back then i was strip you of all your belonging this prepayment and then the other guys in the bar like oh thanks for the meal zero the money is on the table because they're not trying to rip her off oh wait so this is the flashbacks hope we got to see Odin and then oh is that Oh Kinnaman is a Yakuza series like you jerk I remember you from earlier and Kinnaman it's like wah ha ha so I think the guy who was at the bar at Ken Amon just took him out and Ken Imams like you should be careful when you talk in public of course I would overhear you this boards worth one piece of white gold right right luck has finally turned around so kid Amon just kind of he just slid up on some dudes and took their money because he's that kind of so he apparently has changed love what kind of guy was Odin and then Ken moans like once I hand this over to boss crow , I will become and then hand her over your clothes your money - oh so he's just stealing over he's just stealing them then we're in the capital now so some guys like um regarding Lord Odin he really does lack the aptitude for sailing today was 230 attempts to illegally leave the country and the fact that he's still alive is surprising and then he really whoa we saw Odin's dad we see Odin's pops okay so he really has left quite the eventful life even as a baby when he was less than a year old he managed to fling his wet nurse across the room okay standard one-piece V&S but age still he was able to catch rabbits with his bare hands by age four he was able to throw a large boar at a bear crushing it to death what is this guy half troll by eighty six he was wrong okay I'm not gonna read that sentence no anyone who reads to chapter you know it's love but that's just creepy by AJ he was getting drunk and starting fights with gamblers by age nine even the Yakuza blacklisted him and banned him from entering their casino so why would the Shogun let his son be going to casinos just entering the chat once again so why would the show can be letting his prestigious son be going to casinos one piece can be weird like that okay and then he retaliated by senator Kinsey no umpire practically started a war with them and culminated when he was captured I aged then after he nearly killed someone so basically you're saying that this ten-year-old Odin or nine and ten she was fighting the Yakuza by himself and he was ten or nine so huh so the Odin being Admiral level really isn't that far-fetched like some people are saying yong-chol level but I don't know it's kinda Janka level is a bit Yucko level isn't that you know a bit much because we already got bullet supposedly being Janka level I haven't seen Stampede so please don't spoil me I'm actually gonna be seen in the Stampede in four days and I will make a review on that and then he was sentenced to hard labor in the stone quarry but he showed off more if it's unique talents he climbed the ranks at the quarry until he was running the place he is truly a member for the Kazuki family so it's cool that we got to see the former Shogun of wanna know before Orochi but after that his attitude just changed significantly when he was fourteen years old the capital was experiencing a prolonged drought the walls had dried up and countless people were suffering so he diverted to River straight to the capital but that only led to the capital getting flooded so his capture was ordered good heart but a fail good heart but fail so I got Morris but throated he's trying to get the water to the people uh-oh captain Balan is in the chat if y'all ain't checked out back captain Valentia you really should he's got some good stuff his chapter streams are also great he's does gaming - he's got some apex luggage and stuff but if you haven't checked their captain ballon you really should so however Lord Odin just followed the water route and attempted to escape out to sea but in the end the voyage was short-lived I'm just gonna probably cut off the commentary just a little bit just a little bit so we can get through this greatness than at age 15 while it was hiding he couldn't job in the deep temple mountains he's hiding and he's the Shogun's son what a character every night he would I like to keep this channel relatively PG so I'm gonna skip that but that's just messed up Odin I think the respect I have for Odin just went down just a little oh it is just uh Oh older man so oh oh that's better um so the work of the devil even though the girls technically chose to stay of their own free will their loves super mage their parents spouses are more powerful safer I attempted to rescue them but Lord Odin stood his ground an eagle early took them all on betterment became known as should I actually say that word because this is PG and that just has some bad it's sin you Asians okay I'm just gonna say the hacker football oh okay okay even though the he'll grow family got dragged into the fray after failing to prevent the fighting so the hill girl family we know he'll grow the flowers a very powerful dog who's off and you gotta respect him he's been teaching the veeraiah so we know how rogue steel Goro and his phone was probably like first name level okay so Lord Odin's victims in number in the and then his dad sukiyaki is just like that is quite enough of course Lord Odin is 18 now and he stowed cross his trouble on the daily basis do not say another word just deliver this to Odin for me this is the day you finally get caught he went that way captrick in amman soaked in amman is running and he's blond i still can't get over the fact he's like blonde and then kid amongst like hello it on a second I was just trying to cash in a bow a knee and they're like stop lying you swindler cuz he just slit up on some dudes and took their pig I'm not lying just let me go to croco my family mansion and then Kinnaman oh that kid stole our money catch him and Flay him alive I would normally say but in a one-time fight none if you would stand a chance so he'll grow if they're doing his thing and he's like catch him and Flay him alive is what I'd say for stealing their money he's like but yet I'll lose to kill him on cuz kinam on we know current kin amant and he's kind of getting out of his prime but in his prime Kinema is gonna be a very very powerful individual because we know Fox tracking him on the dude can cut fire so that's that's some good stuff right that he's like the opposite of Brooke because no Brooke he's got the cold winds of the underworld aka ice swordsmanship and then you got kin amar with fire swordsmanship you got Earl you gotta love one piece with just all these even the wacky drawings of all man you just gotta love one piece oh I got four people currently watching right now that's pretty good nice okay so and then here was like ah haha you must be joking we will bring him in right now is a subordinate said that not you girl and then you bought the wrong pot the big ones are worth 16 pieces of silver though yeah but I can trade this pot back in thirty pieces of silver right sure no problem and then if you want to add another extra thirty pieces of silver I spent when I bought this pot to the value of the trading it in now it should be worth sixty pieces of silver so I should be able to get a big one oh I kind of know what's going on I suppose you all right here you go please come again hehehe who's that oh we just saw Dan Jiro brah okay so dentro was kind of a dentro was kind of an enigma like I don't think we've seen general yet I think this the first time we've seen dentro in the flashback now that we've seen dentro I got Oakland co-ed and so like I know um more moody in the chat he's my guy um but I know he said in the chat he was disappointed with this chapter I can see why one would be at least so far but this danger overview about like now that we've been seeing in danger oh I respect this chapter this chapter isn't necessarily gonna but it's it's not loaning you know what I said okay okay okay okay this can be a winner for this part mm-hmm a typical order okay so hey hey the brat got a discount just like that what a gullible store owner so dandro just kind of swindled the store owner with words hey judge Errol and dangerous like huh and then the store guys like how did I only end up with thirty pieces of silver yes so we do get to see Odin that's actually that's actually a bit lame moon-like I really want to see Odin but you know all these things he's just been being shadowed out and then suddenly I figured alike would see Odin on in a flashback when it's like an epic part of said flashback okay so the flower capitals crematorium chest MRI please do something about him grandpa cards ooh oh oh hey stop crying I know this is all for a funeral but regardless what is the matter refresher for those who have forgotten Odin is a type of Japanese food okay so I forgot that after cremation we were going to collect the ashes but then we'll just look over there he's using the fire that burns father's body to boil some Oden boiling Oden Lord oh it in and then oh it's like this is really nice this stuff oh I do not understand what you're saying but get off my father this is an insult to his memory okay so Odin is kinda just a jerk I think we can take that Odin is cooking food over the fire over a fire that just cremated somebody's Papa like somebody's Papa's just got cremated and he's using the fire to boil himself some food that's pretty messed up so I'm starting to understand why people are saying Odin was horrible and then he kind of mellowed out and became better and then heir to the Shogun Etowah no cuz who killed him and then Odin's just like gulp he's just drinking some beer and eating the Odin and then he's just just chomping it down and slurping and all that and then he's like see ya the next time we drink together cats whoa it will be in the afterlife oh I get it so cats whoaaaa is his friend and then Otis like now then my condolences to the family my apologies he's not one for detailed explanations so I get it now the guy who died was Odin's man he was Odin's friend and then Odin Odin was kind of like I kind of want to have one last drink with you and he did it by eating and drinking over the fire that cremated him interesting interesting choice of remembering someone and then he's like my condolences to the family and then his guy when if his vassals I guess it's like sorry he's not one for detailed explanations and then they're like huh is that how it is what is with that guy he's so cool this means trouble hide your wives and daughters so this is to charming Odin from the rumors and then the bye just right now and there's just a skeleton there did you guys come to capture me yes well I did end up being bribed but you should not talk about such things out loud you idiot so I think Odin's with Angier oh no he's not anyway what is going on here Doan is avoiding me like they usually do the fire Bell has been ringing nonstop there seems to be no firing nearby hey is it a big fire it's a bigger than a mur fire in Odin's like what how can you not know about I'm kind of confused who's who and who's where I'm taking competing how could he not know about the Kinnaman you should have never brought that with you huh you mean the whiteboard oh so kid mom brought the white boy boss Crow comma probably wanted to use it to crusty old girl family what do you mean danger Oh soaked in Amana Gendron talking like I said earlier wherever that little boar goes its parent is not far behind according to the ancient texts a full-grown white boar is the size of a mountain men you refer to them as mountain gods it is said that a hundred years ago a whole region was annihilated in a single night I thought that was just a fairy tale but if this white boy is here now then that means oh oh man I think people are yelling I'm now anger at a real mountain God we're gonna be in a life there already many victims back with the capital so I'm not seeing this mountain for they're talking about and then we see the eye of the mountain board he's like boink boink and even stuff and then I was right it really showed up oh crap will I be responsible for the destruction of the capital that's an interesting story over here I may not know eating but Kisuke Odin I want you to give me that board so dihn's about to kill the boar and we didn't really get to see the boar we only saw its eyes but that would be the end of the chapter so I'm kind of understanding what my moody was saying when he said I was disappointed with the chapter the general reveal in the Odin would face it reveal were great but this is kind of like an whole cake island when big moms up when big moms pass was revealed you know what I'm saying big mom's pass was revealed and we're all kind of like um this is cool but some of us probably wanted to get back to the movie versus big mom stuff you know what I'm saying I feel like that's kind of what it is right here we're gonna get kind of elongated flashback on Odin so we know who olden actually was who he was before he died and then we'll be getting into the actual story so Ivan see young bender oh we got to see on Odin and yeah I noticed Odin kind of seems like Rizzo he kind of looks like rhizome I don't know what that's gonna be but now we're seeing dead row and at in amman are meeting up with Odin so yeah that's basically it for this video um like if you enjoyed the chapter live reaction I enjoy doing these stuff you know what I'm saying I think it's a lot of fun I find it enjoyable but yeah pop in

good and we got another life chapter VIII action again sorry from the newest got it just the bike but this is the last chapter of the stinking decade okay it's a turn of a decade another turn of a decade from one piece so is pretty monumental and like last chapter had a lot of setup like we got Roger in the Odin and all of that stuff so you know it's something you probably want to look forward to you know no you know what I'm saying so we're just gonna hop right into this one this chapter is called Roger and white bridge that's what it's called okay so you know I'm kind of excited for this one because I was like this seems like this is gonna be fairly uh he seems like it's gonna be a fairly big chapter you know what I mean like we might see some fighting between white beard and Roger some fighting between their cruise or something like that oh and let's just get into the shops here I've been talking too long so of course a couple of pages page on my family so chip on is caught by pirates while she was getting a haircut because they're wanted I guess so now let's get into the actual thing so here he comes the samurai and then Rogers like the one we heard about so it's kind of oh and in Odin's apparently charging at him so they're like here he comes the same are I and then why fear pirates are like wait commander Odin and oh and it's like all I have to do is take their treasure right dealing with them won't be easy the Roger pirates aren't at different levels than the enemies look place before the door you Odin God Meraki I couldn't it was hard for me to say it at first but Odin's just slicing through their ranks like nothing so that's a pretty cool move by him pretty cool so the Roger pies are like the rumors for true he's incredibly strong should we cut them wait oh that's that's that's Caban Gabbana's like should we cut him to pieces railay and railings like fine by me wait Gibran railay I wouldn't want my best two men to get hurt oh so that kind of confirms is like the scopic Aban thing like that he actually is the best like he's the UH the Roger pirates has to offer Baha besides really like I know some people are arguing that scarpered Caban could not be the strongest you know what I mean some people were arguing that like he could not be this on YouTube that kind of confirms it he's like Hassan ji of the crew let me respond to the chat real quick and then we'll just get into the chapter fully you know what I mean so anyway you got Odin just charging towards the rock pirates and that's kinda high that's pretty high plate ona versus Roger pirates and then Rogers like I wouldn't want my two best men to get hurt and then Fraley it's like you just want to face him yourself and Odin's like the are of a wild beast and Rogers like a samurai and then owners like wait is that a Roger coming sorry is that the first named Roger attack was seen brah I think that's the first named Roger attack we've seen come ooh sorry and the translation is a version to Definity so that makes 19 a Roger contents cards and all that he just slammed onand dang and it is like blood coming out of his mouth and he's like huh and he just went flying boom and Odin's like what the heck was that incredible Roger just oh wow Roger Roger went through boom on Odin he just like with his bare fists oh wait was that his breakfast I can't tell oh wait no it wasn't his bare fists it was a sword slash oh that was a sort well that was a sword slash and Odin half-block did I believe it was kinda hard to tell but Odin goes flying and slams into a tree and he's like what was that that was incredible and then suddenly white beard jumps out of nowhere with his giant weapon I feel bad I forget what white British weapon is called and that makes me less of a fan so let me just search what white mace weapon is called up real quick okay so bring his percent oh so basically why produces % oh and he goes that rod we get to see a white beard and Roger Clash how amazing is that how amazing is that a white beard and Roger Clash that's something I didn't expect to see for a while I don't even know what to say it's just so crazy a white beard and Roger white beard and Roger have clashed and we seen it that's insane so you could just got the boom like they just clashed and it's crazy in the mics Wow and again I'm sorry I thought that my mic stand broke so it's gonna be acting up a little bit so they aren't even touching they're not touching and you just got all these like crazy this outburst of energy when they're not even touching and I and it's noteworthy that Roger also has a pole arm which is weird oh wait no he doesn't sorry this drawing is kind of confusing probably because of the redrawing so he does it looks like he had a pole on for a second but he doesn't so you got white beard Roger just staring each other down and there's just this whole like clash of conker Zaki so it's pretty crazy and then the wife your pirates are like our ship and white Brits like you look good and Rogers like how many years hasn't been Newgate and they both say give me everything you have and then wipe it's the signature laughs or or or I'm Roger does ha ha ha and then the wipe your powers are like come on then and the right parts are like loop them so we see a lot of Roger pirates we still don't really know their names so the Roger pirates versus to wipe your pirates the battle between these two great pirate crews lasted three days and three nights with the upper hand constantly shifting from once from side to side I knew they were gonna ask me now I hope they would an off-screen it but I kind of knew they were gonna ask mean it because like oh and it's not that nice Odin couldn't just let us get a battle between the ROG of the wipe your pirates like the whole thing we saw a clash between white beard and Roger how rare is that how rare is that it's the same it's just the same clash between white beard and Roger dang that that's the same so the battle they're both so powerful to battle and lasted three days and three nights three days and three nights like we going all shown up in here you feel me but it's like that's how powerful they are that they're able to fight for three days and three nights without one side winning and the fact that they have that much stamina to be able to do though like you know we dang so the battle lasts three days and three nights four days later wooden outrageous shirt where did you get it wait a minute you're drinking too much we agreed everyone would have to same amount the southern sake is too good I'll give you three crates for it this has to become a gift exchange that's what Bailey says suddenly they're intermingling apparently and they're partying together that's crazy like they fight for three days and three nights and now they're just not allies but now they're like partying together like you know but that just shows you the familial side of white beer and the adventurous I Roger mixing together like after the burnt themselves out of the battle like they're willing to set their differences aside and just party like that's some classic one piece right there that's some classic one piece and you see jozu and the big guy from the roger pirates just clicking l mugs and all that it's pretty cool and then we see Blackbeard he's like those boys I guess he's not Blackbeard yet he's teach we see teach be like are those boys over there are predators apprentices and the droves is like yeah they've been in there for a while they don't look very strong their attitude is quite impressive so resi shakes and buggy like it's kind of funny cuz like buggy he's kind of trash but even so he's just like this was shanks Jenks is like and Budd you just like doing the same thing he's like like buggies just trying to look all cool and stuff that's just kind of funny like buggy looks so much more epic now and cooler now than he does like in the guard dog why not gonna lie even though I'm not trying to disrespect the great but you saw me you feel me hey shanks do you see that guy with the hat yeah he didn't sleep during the truce we had for the last few days no sorry he great he didn't sleep during the truce we had to the last few days huh why I think that's a translation our error I think he means uh well I guess what makes us I don't know because that's a little bit of a translation error but I guess I'll just take it at face value I heard he's never slept in his life ha how is that even possible I'm jealous it's just crazy they just look so funny it looked like so young and cool it just crazy just seemed shanks this young he's like huh I'm jealous [ __ ] he's like you would have twice as much time to enjoy your life if you didn't need to sleep it's not that simple idiot he's a monster can you read it yes I can I can translate it for you but why did he transcribe this these symbols are a secret code the way to decode them was passed from generation to generation to the firstborn Kazuki Kazuki clan from wardo we took the 13 years ago we were able to do what nobody else had done he reached the end of the log pose Island Road star earth reached the end of the log post island grows darker so the final island in the Grand Line is called growth star hmm so like there were theories that the last island was Elba but apparently it's an island called Road star and if you're wondering why I'm like not going psycho because we found the name of the island is because no joke I I spent the last six hours doing some programming homework and all that so I'm kinda just chill right now you feel me I'm pretty chill right now it's like dang but the last island is cold rude star okay like yeah that's pretty cool like we get we know the name of the final island Rogers like we we reached the end of the law Poe's the island of lodestar but when we got there I realized it wasn't the last island a long post couldn't guide us further because the needles kept spinning but I'm sure there's one last Island and island do you need to reach in order to travel the world a feat never done before it has these inscriptions marked on four special red stones I believe they're clues to find that Island but the world government ban deciphering the pilot lifts long ago I used to think they were ordinary objects so I was surprised when they discovered that they were essential reference points for achieving our goal so apparently the stuff apparently the stuff the stuff we know about the partner glyphs apparently that wasn't common knowledge but for Rogers uh demise and I guess that makes a lot of sense it was probably kind of the trailblazer before the world government I kept this under wraps so like yeah this is this this is this is pretty high this is pretty high so he said so he says um that means to well confirm it doesn't want anyone to reach the final island their actions only confirmed the legend that there's a huge hidden treasure there if we can get there surely will be the biggest pirate crew in the whole world the biggest that's right if then I'll be and Odin to my bigger like what and then he's like cual rah rah what a load of crap Roger he will get by any chance Odin was like I was so stunned I couldn't move it already left me speechless twice who is this guy anyway please let me borrow Odin for one year new gate this is my last request with him by my side I know I can get to the final island hey what why are you deciding to Spri yourself that's Odin what's happening Captain Rogers bound to white beard stop it captain there are rivals I beg you Odin please sailing with us for one year and Odin's like stop this this is shameful you should bow to me and white beards like quit screwing around Roger you really think I'd let you take a member of my family and they look bad then they're like oh ah the old man is trick I could give them my pumping even though I tried to hide it what do these stones have to do with the Kisuke clan what was this meeting with Roger America incidents why do you can before I could even think straight I already have my answer I'm going to go to the thought I want to get to the bottom of this please so let me go them you look disgusted and why beers like that because like we all know that wipe it disgust face like that white bear disgust face bow to become iconic like the Odin disgust face and the white bear disgust face like that bow to become iconic stuff you know anything we like that bunny face breeze like like you know that face like you made that marineford like yeah you know how that you know how that that iconic face like you know those disgust aids those discussed those disgusted faces God would be iconic you feel me like no cap her white beers like he's all like looking disgusted and he's like no kidding of course I hate the idea we're brothers aren't we but if it's only for a year no in he's like but it's only for a year why teach am please I've been nekomamushi and inuarashi and what you might call it ezel is like we'll stay here we prefer the ship so we'll wait for your return here and Odin it's like sure you have become amazing pirates so you're free to choose what you want to do and why feels like she's all like white beards all white beard trigger like he triggered he's so drinking my beers like but I but you know I feel wiper though like his little brother like he's not calling white beard nothing like he not call him white beard his son he calling him his brother like are not sorry he's not calling Odin his and he's going out and his brother like white beard thinks of Odin as his little brother not his son like everybody else so you know Odin's a valuable asset to the crew he's super strong and he's like a brother to white beard so like you yeah like like I feel that like like if I were him to like you know I I'd be like that you feel me like I wouldn't want him to go and he's all mad and then they're like parks aren't you gonna say goodbye Rogers gave us all the treasure on his ship as a thank you it's incredible there's so much and supplies to like you just see a mountain of Christian supplies in the background and wipers like give those supplies back right now idiots do you want to end his family to starve to death and they're like oh yeah yes sir and then there and then alright departure like see you soon don't forget to bring me back some souvenirs it was then that the second chapter of my life as a pirate began the beginning of a new journey whitey chin is a great man but Roger is comparable is incomparable lucky me and Rogers like it has been a while since I last had a baby so their names are mementos gained Hyori they reminded me of my childhood that's relay captain Roger we found spies there like got the rod we thought spies and the note is like in a Russian echo bush me what are you doing here and then interoceanic mumu char like we had so much fun with you Odin sama and then they're like hey the cat and the dog are gone too those idiots those are my few pirates captain needs your knowledge Oh induct you as fast as the captain did you hear that's all the Roger pirates they're just like all like oh no you you any one of us yeah you definitely ain't one of us so um yo like if I'm talking about the chat tomorrow you snitching on me bro why you snitching on me but um the Roger pirate throw bike we won't accept you here then Odin is like ah a port city do they have ingredients the port city is like pirates wait Odin don't have bands like that without thinking the captain is gonna kill you My Ride your scissors were stolen he stole my eggs huh this area lawless whatever I don't care go man I can't quite tell what's happening but like you can tell their rating and but yeah oh oh didn't got all this stuff because Roger pirates for all I go we won't accept you and then Odin does some great stuff like you oh then oh then I thought I was in his name they're all loving with him and they're like let's make a toast to our time with Odin and Odin just told them a bunch of food and stuff the crocuses like you just have one year left to live and then Odin's like what and Rogers like ha ha ha and the Rogers like that's why I'm in a hurry and then he's like I'm going to die in Odin's like yeah and they go up the knock up scream to the sky island and then they're like whoa this is crazy the world is so huge it is truly endless do you think that there are people living in the sky unbelievable they're on the sky islands I found it it's over here Wow a Bell made of gold how are we going to take it cap then so yeah oh this is cooling all the way back there like that um switch me call it that sorry I just lost my train of thought but the art the Scott the arc all the way back there when we learned that Roger had been there that's when we learned that Roger Roger had gone to the sky islands we get to see with our own eyes like what 16 years later so bruh this is insane this is insane so then they're like you can come back when your buggies like wow they'll made it forward how are we gonna take this and they're like you can come back when you're a captain bunny I have no time for this bug he's like what let's take a piece or two the stone has quite a voice so it was easy to find does she happened to say something about incredible power that's Roger information about a weapon called Poseidon's were in here right what does it write what I say on it I have come here and will lead this passage to the farthest end of the world oh so we didn't know how Roger wrote that on the pond igloo but Odom was the one wrote it on him a word crazy all the stuffs come together and he's like like this good work Odin I'm going to the end Roger the goal for which you risk your life the final chapter of your great adventure and then it says revelation after revelation and that's fact this chapters all revelation like we saw white beard versus Roger the vodka pirates versus though a white beard pirates and this ends the stupidity but the Roger pirates are stronger than the wife you're pirates like ok nah ok they fought each other for three days and three nights with the weight of the battle shifting nobody ever getting the upper hand until they Troost but that shows you how stinking powerful these groups were they were not stronger than the other like they were both the top tier crews of the whole thing and then we just saw all these stuff coming together like you saw that Odin was the one who wrote Rogers message on the phonic lifted in the sky islands that we seemed so long ago for some of the og leaders like 16 years ago for me it was a few years back when I started my 1pz journey like this is insane this is nuts this chapter was amazing last chapter of the decade throwing back to the last decade like you feel me like a decade ago was when we are more than a decade ago probably was when we saw Rogers message at sky island and then it ends the decade with calling back to it the last decade decade not decade like that's crazy you feel me dang this chapter like I'm not good at understand I get the shaft of solid eight out of ten like we've seen some goat stuff in this chapter like this chapter was truly a good decade closer you feel me this was a decade closer for sure like dude they did this crazy this crazy crazy love bruh I know I keep saying this crazy but it's great yo a decade call back at the end of the decade wipe your burst of Roger pirates owned and joining the run pirates we were all wondering how and why Odin would ditch right beard but he asked white birds permission so you know you whew me that's insane and it was there was no animosity bro this jobs good like this is the last chapter the stinking decade the decade closing chapter this was a pretty good chapter so like predictions for the next chapter I'm pretty sure that it's gonna be called back to 1o like I'm not sure what we'll learn I feel like it's gonna probably focus marijuana with the next chapter in like a month or so that's what I feel like it's gonna do but I'm not sure like there's so many places that could go from here like it could go to a laugh tale it could go to um why don't like the story could branch out from so many places from here the flashback could branch out from so many different places like I can't really say where it's gonna go but all I can't say is wherever it goes it's gonna be like it's gonna be crazy it's gonna be hype this chapter was pure - Roger pipe you're pirates chillin together fighting each other trade you members you feel me scene Odin right the skyline a sky island stuff the fact that Odin can understand the point of glyphs and write in the language like in this dope this this was a crazy good chapter eight out of ten of my opinion great stuff so that's probably where I'm gonna have to sign off for now great chapter eight out of ten you know what's up thanks for watching if you know my content and all my content like go subscribe to notifications for more one piece of content comment down below what your agent if the chapter was like out of ten you

because landslides or something so they blocked off the road to go to the end of the road and we were planning to do the hike to Hana copy a beach and to the falls but I know if it's gonna happen today you're gonna have to hike from our car here all the way out to the end of the road and then start the hike which is just crazy I don't know if I want to do it even Mikey is saying he wants to do it he's trying to find like secret routes that goes like into the the trees and into the forest and on the beaches and I don't know if I'm gonna do it or not that's like a far far hike and a far walk just to start the hike you know I mean I got a nice view last night was was crazy so those guys that apparently was stuck on the other side of the river they eventually got out it was probably nine o'clock when they said they got out at night imagine crossing the river it that you know at night and then they had to walk all the way back to their car I think they just crossed the river the river like just got less like less water and so you know they got to have the chance to cross the river so yeah things went well so I'm waiting for Mikey I know he is that guy likes to go against the grain on everything they tell you don't do this that's what he wants to do don't do that that's what he wants to do a little child okay so since the road is closed we're here at the Hanalei pier where all the tourists are and I think this is where they shot the movie Aloha but that movie really sucks so not too proud of that whoa drone so are you happy is this your happy face are you mad tell me why you're mad come on come on and tell me you're not mad you're not mad you're criticizing the surf instructors and tell him I know you're supposed to push up with your hands not your chin such a

beautiful name [Music] work yeah sorry I I don't I don't make landslides that's the guy upstairs he does it but if you want to insult him girl we're making a stop at all the like lookouts since we couldn't go on the hike today so this is the Hanalei lookout it's not a great view I cut all this tree out so is it all is it all inspiring like you did when you came like 12 years ago no it's nothing it's like tourists what do you say tourists are tourists tourists tourists sounds like the total tours it's the white chicken and the brown chicken getting along is in society have hope hey oh this is not it we're going out there went down and all and all the way down there this is a we're in Queens bath where the Queen takes a bath so you need to get out of here Oh close your eyes when she is taking a shower all right you give a DAB on the haters dab dab on the Gators yeah yeah so I jumped like from here in and just the tide was a little bit higher but the waves are even more raging than this and I was really nervous and look there's like that one rock right in the middle yeah you know but this is not there's more over there is not Queens back yeah and then I had to swim hard to like climb back up here on these rocks we cleaned up here yeah I did they're right there that way but this is when I was what 19 18 let's go let's go more down wow I got to do the bit again here it is oh it's the Queen's hole I forgot what I said you're supposed to remember Oh the Queen's hold oh yeah you're not making it funny I'm sorry and can you imagine like just sitting in there look that's cool right and then the water falls the weeping wall we found it here it is I've been telling him here it is like every single water puddle that we saw and trying to trick him but he doesn't fall for it here's the here's the Queen's bed or kind of okay I jump right here I think there's like more than one this is not just the only one I think there's more - not sure there you go here's the bath yeah

gonna lose them you gotta put them in your hands or you got like a pigeon toe is that it hurry up hurry up in the middle no jump on the rock where it's the most shallow yes idiot serenity now what's your last words I don't know that is what don't touch you got a flat not like needle jump it's cuz you needle jumped like a needle no you gotta be like this at the end you gotta be flats alright hopefully a huge wave comes all and here it is I see that turtle it's coming it's coming oh it's going that way you were just there like a really big one like a really really big one your wish is my command your wish is my command look at that laughs is so annoying tell them get out Queen the queen is telling you to get out the queen is telling you to get out yeah you think she's excited

"w6oTyUbbg14": "question of course is one piece one pieces looks good and we got a one piece live stream kind of a follow-up live stream for chapter 956 we're here with frozen dawn what's up bro what's good man okay yeah yeah you were saying something yeah we're just gonna say like mr. frozen don't Tom I'm glad to be here okay cool so the streams kind of like 956 with the warlord abolition the world our system initiative bukai abolition system that's gonna have a lot of ripples all over the one piece word if you know what I'm saying that's just kind of gonna go to every single corner because the warlords are supposed to be one of the three balance and powers even though to be honest I don't even really see how they balance the world out that much because they're kind of just an extension of the world government okay so oh yeah so I guess part of the reason it's kind of a big deal well it's a big deal but it doesn't seem as much of a big deal as people are making it out to be I kind of feel like the Warlord's are gonna have to do with something dating back to the void century and that's why it's such a big deal and it's a bigger deal than we're thinking but the Warlord's just individually I just kind of want to discuss right now sorry right now at least for now where do you see the war lords going like each of the warlords like take Beau and Hancock for example she's her island surrounded by Marines and even she even if she ends up beating them back what she gonna do she can't hold them off forever you know and I'm saying where do you like the vision Hancock going that's a good question I don't believe she has any way of communicating with Luffy maybe Rayleigh and that will be interesting to see it may be like I don't know get in touch ever really maybe he comes through and like he settles he finds like a place for them to settle you know me or they could defend their territory to to the death and like maybe maybe the raising of the cops back up you know I make the fight they're all spread out and I there's not enough men like a whole army of Amazon Lily women you know man that's true but I actually kind of envisioned them possibly going to want Elsa I know a lot of people are always saying this person one one oh this person's going to want Oh even at one point I was saying and now might show up tomorrow because of the - tattoos and he lives on the moon that's a bit of a stretch that still kind of believe it but that's a whole different story but now that we know x-drake is part of sword and you have Kobe contacting them I feel like the information might get leaked so I could see them going to wanna but I'm not quite sure on that you think that'd be interesting don't be interesting I don't see Hancock I don't know how long sorry I don't know how long it would take them to get to one Oh I know I know like they got a special cheek because that takes them across the combo and whatnot um that would be very interesting to like I know like the Navy have no mechanisms on their ships and basically go pass the combo know it safely smoothly um they'd be very interesting to see if they follow Oh Hancock - one who you know I mean I after date right get rekt no I mean cuz like they're barely get rekt it's like there's no way day you're taking a ball heck no man right because some people are kind of putting ball Hancock on way lower level than she should be uh I kind of inherent ooh tier of like opening or something but some people are saying she's like Nami level and I kind of think that's very disrespectful and super underrated oh yeah very very what level would you put Hancock on well level Oh like a strong I said she spends more thanks pass Marya Ling the more we've seen ortho well most warlords are past Moria like Maury and crocodile crocodiles probably past your primary is a different story but what did you think of that mihawk scene what I think the me rock scene oh I enjoyed it I liked that he got it you know interested again and like the thrill of being chased you know I mean you know I feel like he's been missing that for like a while even though zero is on the rise to be coming like the world's greatest swordsman I mean of course he gotta face me hawk again but I mean just the time pass me I've just been chillin he just been waiting for a challenge he order has he gets off the vine through its really bored yeah always seemed like a bored guy like right now they just a ton of vice-admiral was after him which I don't think makes a ton of sense I'm kind of feeling like they're probably gonna send an emerald after them or after him or something like that if I wouldn't never know when I what sure mo do you think would be most suited for going after me Hawk I'm kind of thinking up with some food to tour if they were descending Admiral I mean food ashore will be fine but I was thinking more of the lines of Azzaro or Greenville I want to see what Greenwood can do in a situation like that I think a lot of people want to see what Greenville can do so I know I was saying if kids were sent anywhere I feel like it's gonna be the one Oh since he already kind of wanted to go to one on the first place yeah it was it was you know what's his I just forgot that cuz it's named for a second it was asked to Kazuki about that I'm kind of feeling if he gets deployed anywhere it's probably gonna be don't want only probably it's gonna be deployed don't wanna but if they're sending somebody after me shock it's probably gonna be food at aura green bow and I agree with you I kind of want to seek green boughs abilities since there's nothing to indicate what his abilities might be of course this name is green bow but then kisser was yellow monkey and I'll kgs blink and they don't have monkey or pheasant double treats you know what I'm saying yeah you know what it's keep going percent Farah sword right I've seen a picture or image of sach uzuki with a sword on his right on his left where is the writer love this - right right it was yeah it was his right arm this is right I'm not sure I'm not sure if he's connected completely towards like the leadership of sword or is he just a part of sword you know I mean I don't think on this you don't think it's part of sort ordered it drew that well well I actually think whoa for the first thing Kobe and activate they seem to be like more respectful Marines sword some people are even thinking sword isn't even necessarily a Marine organization it's an organization with in the Marines of like the good Marines no I'm not sure how much I support that but you know Big Talk anime or anime James just changed his name to big doc anime you know him I do not I might have to check him out he got super slow-mo in a in BDA and freedom stay and silver surfer and all that but he activated an interesting video he was saying he thinks out hideous part of sword and the reason the sword was on a kinase arm is like to say okey G because defeated out key G and it would kind of make sense out key G leave there means he didn't completely leave them he kind of went like x-ray and went away as part of sword I think that'll make a pretty good amount of sense yeah I guess yeah if he did make if he did like when a smoker be a part of that as well that's a smoke a problem would be part of that but I feel like since sword almost seems like a good CP almost because CP and sort are both kind of off the charts people don't really know about them or cp9 like see peas 1 to 8 and I think CP 0 to the public kind of knows about them CP 9 is the one that's kind of off the map I feel like some Murray wouldn't want to be part of that they'd want to be in the spot like a smoker definitely wants to be in the spotlight he wants to be an AMRO or something so we can chase down Luffy so I don't think that kind of position would appeal to smoker I'm still questioning like what a smoker go from here like it's been a while since we've seen smokers since no just roses I'm not just resident punk hazard in I would I wouldn't necessarily know he's back know and ready to go no I mean like of course it's been weeks or months since it says no just about a month there kiddo cares about a month or two yeah Blake do you think he's risen up the ranks like Kobe or do you feel like he's weird like he's doing I kind of feel like smoker he's probably just chilling with fujitora right now cuz we know fujitora technically can't really go in a Marine base I feel like smokers probably gonna be tagging along with fujitora since they both wanted the shaky booboo Kai's system demolished but I think that smoker might have written up in the Rings like Kobe because rear admiral was the fourth highest rank in the Marines right and Kobe before every he was a captain and then he went up to ranks after that and became a Rear Admiral so at first people thought it was a typo and then it was come from not a typo think we're gonna find out that Kobe fought some crazy opponents maybe not crazy opponents but he fought some opponents and did something fairly big in the revery which is why he shot up two ranks in like a week and smoked done something similar not sure though yeah that was pretty amazing when I started I was like yeah Kobe yeah I was like two ranks you're rising up in the ranks speaking the characters we haven't seen in a long time that bug you seen though I kind of was hoping he changed at least a little bit but yeah bogey I feel like buddy's gotten bigger a lot bigger a flight from that cover spritz and eye color and eye color pay is OB I saw a buggy game fair by Luffy and I Luffy been I think yeah I almost got fed by and then on bowling a card with feeding smoker I think a flight smoker may come to one oh as well which I'm hoping for it cuz like I've been waiting to see him and I want him to see the progression of Luffy to feel inspired again and I want to chase after him again and want to climb up the ranks to like yeah Ketchum yeah cuz smoker actually saw this interesting theory by Ben Beckman I don't know if you remember him I know him Hugh staff 25k subs but it was a text channel so he made a new channel for his voice since YouTube demonetized text channels and all that Kabam black he made an interesting he basically figured out what smokers admiral name would be if he became an admiral that was pretty cool smokers name would probably be sure are you because white dragon because smokers personality kind of fits the zodiac dragon so yeah smoker climbing up the ranks if he climbs up the ranks I kind of wanted to be an emerald before i/o on who do you think the new gen Admirals will be oh for sure Kobe Kobe uh maybe smoker of course I think drink a beer Admiral I mean mate I mean maybe let me think about it let me think about it maybe maybe you know what the new the new keratins it's kind of crazy it's crazy to put put them out there but late they will hike though during the reverie you know I mean forget the woman named woman in the man's um mama soggy and chatting okay okay mama soggy in check yeah mama sorry that's that would actually already be her Admiral name cuz mama saw gave me instinct around a bit she should just still be mama soggy and chat and I don't know examining would be they appeared in a movie before I don't remember which movie but I heard they were in a one-piece movie so some people are already familiar with them yeah Herbert Hannon of course movies aren't canon oggi also actually kind of has this to that jackie has room yeah the same spider tattoo so people are making a lot of theories about a bet it could possibly mean that there's another marina organization like called spider or something and shocky was once a part of it and then she defected to the rocks or whatever I don't know that's would be a pretty interesting thing because Jackie she's kind of an enigma she doesn't seem that from whom you saw her but she's also seems that strong just logically she should be really strong I agree I believe she is really strong it's not hard to good no I was just gonna say what's here when you put Jackie at when I push a key oh yeah I put up there with too soon actually maybe hardness is here where you put snow it cuz come on Cyril and garper like close you know right like tactically saseru will be up there but dark is fairly up there as well I'm not I'm not very big on power scaling or scaling people no but I got a I got a good sense of where I will place people know in a Miss coming one piece the scanner one piece so yeah back to the abolition at the world Lursa stem so once the system's been demolished that's supposed to just send ripples across the whole world where do you see those ripples going I'm thinking there's probably gonna be the fall of some countries since they're warlords are now gone if there's any other countries like that like for example of the Kuja empire since they're at least gonna have to move at this point they can't stay in the same place I feel like that's like they were isolated you know like around a combo nobody will bother going over there again if they're affecting from that place a slightly for bugging them a slight they may have stumbled onto our island that was inhabited by people and like they were being you know fearful for their lives and like Nana - no she just [ __ ] [Music] so she bouquet is now abolished I feel like they they're gonna have to rise up again like after they have the map of bugging up defecting as well and blackberry Blackbeard had his own Island and I don't know I don't know what I don't know what it was before blackberry I got there or was it like white bears territory which will be interesting enough because it's called foot this when I saw the VIS translation it was called full of lay and when I saw buggies no territory it was called empty Bluffs Nami it made me think it correlates with the characters you know me yeah and and I feel like go ahead now you keep going and I feel like far as far as blackberry he's willing to go all out and far as buggy he's not willing to back it up I mean he's got his man with him but he's gonna take them into like the front lines why he's skedaddled to the back lines and just you know skirts all the way out mommy right she's gonna let them take the El or he barely gets away like but no big now because he just has that giant curtain for clothes yes party out I think you know kind of cool yeah go now imagine them being able to like actually defeat the Marines and like escaping altogether and buggy you know just being oppressed by his crewmates again no I'm just thinking that so I don't honestly kind of think that's probably likely to happen because he's got a lot of level threes and level fours on his crew and I think level by verse 2 from info down so the level fibers are just below the levels so that just below like a scroll Kyle - guys they how's uncle level characters in level 6 so levels is not a real broad you go from crocodile - bullet - Shiki but pirates would probably be just under somebody like a case of crocodile so maybe somebody like Frankie so if you got a lot of Frankie level characters just fighting for you you're probably gonna be able to bust through the Marines at least find an opening to cut through you're right I feel like Bucky's probably gonna escape and I don't know I feel like once now look the warlord system's been abolished you don't want to say everybody's coming to one oh but now that there's all these warlords running and by effects oh they're all their allies and all their terror victorious people it's just a whole chain reaction of people running so there's a likelihood they could get a huge ton of people coming - ah no because even though they've got what is it 4,000 people on the Alliance Cardos Alliance got 30,000 pirates know by 20,000 beasts pirates 10,000 Orochi dudes and then you got the big moms crew which is probably like 80 or 70 people give or you maybe even a hundred but they're still like her commanders so they actually have a lot of opposition so from the ripples of the abolition of the system you're probably gonna get a lot of people running tomorrow because of the fact that it's not owned by the world government so they're gonna go to war know they won't be able to be touched by the world government that's what I'm kind of thinking I'm thinking that's part of the reason the system was over to have that system but abolished now because now they're gonna be going to wha no that's not under the jurisdiction of the world government to get away from the world government some of the warlords it'll be interesting I feel like I was gonna say somebody again but it I didn't want to know triple over what she was talking about um now you can go be um I feel like if Bucky did get captured he would go back to infidel but like I feel like he would escape right out there no I going to if y'all don't like like this theory that there's a small theory day if he went to impel down mm-hmm miracle II under that crap star day he's under no no no that Devils look that he's always getting like caught up in yeah like in the mistress of no misfortunes blight I always seemed like a blessing at the end of it you know I mean like here for sounds like he found Luffy at the mmm put down but like he made it out no out of infidelity like with yes he had area Scranton of it yeah when I'm a scratch and like he had crewmates behind him like he had made new crewmates an old crewmates forward together with him and like I feel like if he go with the back he's gonna gain even more you know he went anymore and like doflamingo make it out of infidel that way I'm flying to places like Barclay was there right you want a cover page of chapter 666 yeah by light to be live yeah okay oh that happened to be alive and I was like how come Barclay is still alive because he was supposed to Gavin oh you know that full of salt attacked from Magellan and like I figured that magenta have probably had one of those bowel movements and like he parquet he probably came back down to like his normal form while Barclay skedaddled bypassed them and went went back to hiding in the prison you know me at level 55 level 5.5 and I feel like what a time but just there maybe like it looks like a sad story arc on the cover page hopefully like hopefully like Capone them graphs up you know I mean like I find Lola in front don't worry about the Lola but I hope that they meet up with each other they're like fun funner a pact to break out of impel down again and bring me go along with on with along with everybody else yeah I didn't put that together and just going on backtrack buggy we nobody's got the devil's luck so if he's like going around he's priest Barclay who would go with them to get to loose or something like that and if they don't from Ingo if they break doflamingo out doflamingo is so many times stronger than loopy was when impelled down when luffy brokaw tempo down and doflamingo is like a rival power to Magellan I think Magellan is probably a little bit stronger but doflamingo can definitely contend with him and don't forget that Venables now the new warden and Domino's now the new head jailer now I know they weren't super strong pre time-skip but you know lots of people rose up during the times gift so they might be a bit of trouble so we could potentially see our whole cover story and pail down break and that would be pretty cool to see cuz they don't from Inglewood get back out rearrange his crew get his crew back together and yeah would probably go sailing Barclay would probably go try bar Luffy you could get a lot of stuff out of that yeah yeah that's what I was thinking like I was gonna make a video on it but never did and like I don't know it just stuck with me you know I'm glad we talked about today yeah buggy is no pirate king level but speaking of memes there's just I'd say there's four means like straightening x' and the one piece of wrote one button to caesar three walk paul and for caribou did i don't i saw lots of people talking about an Ellis comfort a story but I was surprised when I got to I wanna know and saw caribou was there because I had watched the anime almost up until that point I watched the anime up until the kind of curry fight then I kind of just read the rest of my way there but I did not realize the whole cover story page about caribou getting to 100 you don't know no I didn't it was crazy I just think caribou might join the straw hats because I know it sounds crazy first but you know how Otis said that forward enemy would join now bar link in the old enemy but my eyes Barclay was never really an enemy I know he fought Sanji but the moment he met the straw hats he became their friend and then lots on he had been it was like nah this is stupid after he lost and helped them escape by sacrificing himself so my eyes he was always a friend he could be the old enemy but that kind of doesn't seem to fit me no Luffy kinda tends to turn bad people good so the fact that caribou already has beef with them and then he kinda could become like better and he's got a little get out because one thing that's all earth me is the straw hat crew does not have a little gay devil food user I'm like they got they've basically gotta making at this point they've got a fisherman they're probably gonna get a no , I don't know about Ron Klain they got a shape-shifting reindeer they've got tons of parametres xoan but they don't know how to logia you know what I'm saying something like if Nami doesn't eat the you can you can owe me then it would be a terrible would be a good fit into the crew you know what I'm saying cuz even when he was captured by them he was already being sucked into the rowdy craziness with the straw hats you think Carol yeah it would be interesting I like to know what would be his position and like what would be his dream aspirations to like want to go out to sea in search for the one piece Russia I kinda feel like some means and aspirations like oh just kind of running out of them because even with gym bags Jim Bay he had his dream was kinda to get the fisherman to go on land but they're kind of doing that without him regardless if a journey was goofy like at this point he joined the straw hats because he wanted to sail with Luffy his dream was being there with Luffy when luffy completed his dream you know what I'm saying yeah so it could possibly be something like that and with Kara she doesn't really have a dream but I would be so shocked if she didn't join the straw hats and speaking of joining the straw hats there's somebody I think will rejoin that straw hat so I think you know who I'm about to say uh rejoin ya Jimmy right nah Jim Jim Bay is already joined vivia please I thought oh I thought this was kind of dumb but what it did say DB was an official straw hat member and I was kind of like well that doesn't make a ton of sense to me but now that we know some big incident happened in alabasta that probably involves Sabo and Blackbeard's heading over there I'll talk about Sabo in a minute and there's this whole theory that Cobra got assassinated and Vivi is on the run it could be the opportune time from VB to drawing up with that rice was more BB so weak but weak like she could have gotten stronger over at the time skip past and gotten a little bit stronger if she had heavier plans to join the straw hats once more but also friendship was always a more important than strength and Lupe's eyes from the get-go oh they just always happened to be strong for the sake of the plot your and I think we become potentially join the straw hats again yeah that would be interesting do you see Lucy going back to where Mary Jo's or heading back the other way just to say VZ or Sabo it's possible I mean if it comes out in a newspaper today somehow so got K attempted to kill coach you know V viewer the fact that they set up Sabu like make it seem like he killed a cobra and maybe ran off away with Vivi no I mean like what do you think point oh I think I was definitely possible because after Juan oh the only two arc scene or three arcs we know are gonna happen this wrath tell L bath and the final war but that doesn't mean there aren't gonna be arcs in between because I know Oda said won't be sent in five years but we all know that's like eight years after minimum so could potentially be in art cuz after Juan oh I don't know so first of all before I say this do you believe there's a difference between Admiral and Yoko in terms of just like the strengths the difference you think or to be more blunt do you think young curls are stronger than Amaral's young girls are stronger than animals yes okay so that's what I'm trying to say right still the thing is after wha no so here's the thing I know a lot of people are saying roofies not gonna be uncle level after wah no but I think one he'll at least contend with an admiral I'd rather him be contending with an admiral but at this point they're facing two yonkos and even if one piece does end in ten years if you've got those three arcs and the last line of war are should be a ginormous arc and then if you're trying to squeeze in one or two more unless one piece will just go for another 15 years what I kind of opened up with it anymore and oh that I don't want to look back on food stuff is work at this point if Luffy comes out yong-chol Louisville after 108 B or even Admiral level but say Janka level there might be a marine for 2.0 or him going to save Sabu or maybe in a different manner it's a put ton of people just to like prove that this is now a you know super powerful overpowered Luffy so I do think the idea is possible I don't know I don't want to count out dragon though just yet I don't want to count out the fact that a dragon is wanted to confirm that if his second-in-command is you know really if you if he did whatever he did in the newspaper you know I mean or if you have or whatever happened to like him in a newspaper you know I mean I think yeah he could play a part in to like going back towards Maryjo us and looking for Sabo or Luffy can do it I don't know I'm not sure how it's gonna go but it will makes more sense if dragging got off his tush and like as he made a plan in motion to like secure the second make a man and find out the real true for behind a paper that Morgan spit out so like yeah we did forget about big me more yeah yeah I was gonna talk about a second before we do do you think that was that like I don't think many people think he's dead but there's only one thing that kind of indicates he could possibly be dead I don't think he is the fact that Blackbeard said we'd I don't want to let it fall into the hands of the Navy we're setting out the fact that no stir the marinara know me for a while could mean I was actually dead but then again if the newspaper said he was dead and he wasn't actually dead that could explain why he's going out but I think black bear might be after the mera mera know me so the newspaper even if Sabo himself isn't the newspapers might have said that Sabo is you know dead I feel like the newspaper made us sell a little bit more than what it should have sir and I feel like the fact that good and I think that's what the newspapers usually do yeah and I feel like far the BlackBerry having the insight to like the pic thing wet sure what's good and what's not no I mean what's true and what's not true I feel like he has a good chance I feel like he had to get a head on the shoulders to the pace to the paint like oh yeah that's the stuff that's it that's the mark that's the blaze then you know I know I [ __ ] in a high Sheen you know where he finds no lazy man award and like he goes to this to that place you know I mean I fight black bears doing the same thing and like play says like no that was nonetheless up there came i'm not a chance not a chance for I'm I'm talking about like way back when he was flying yellow like oh yeah yeah yeah and like I'm thinking like Blackbeard is gonna like fine pluton or maybe he might go out to shield sure Hoshi because like even though she's with guard her from not gonna be there forever like he's gonna leave like I feel like and I feel like blackberry has a way to get you know down to see and like you know sneak his way into our er Ryoga whoo-hoo kingdom reuse Kingdom and I he make his nasty Roche useful there's like did you be honest your host he is Poseidon yeah besides glutton you know Cheryl she is Poseidon and my I don't know if people know that I'm cared to see what Carrie booth was telling somebody you remember that I don't know if you realized you read the cover story of the light caribou was calling in towards someone I like he was looking he was calling you calling someone to inform them about the weapon put beside him cause he had heard right and I think I think was a little bit I think was I think it was a little bit into like the chapters as well yeah over but he has stopped by Lucy no all right sure hope she gets I think it's possible because even though share Hoshi is a annoying I it's really doing but even so let's be real he's just by default went but strongest people perhaps the strongest individually she's literally yong-chol up because if she's younger level if you're in the secrecy Sea Kings are fairly weak if you get a fatty Kings coming up at your ship from underwater I don't care if you big mom Luffy black beard or Qaeda war with Cairo you might be able to get your crew on your back and fly away or big mom maybe get a cloud to escape but either way your ship is going down whether you escape or not yeah so sure horse she's pretty powerful and that something Blackbeard could definitely go after and think about this what was the possess what would the exact thing that black bear said in that in that panel well do you remember what with the desire thing to blubbers the of chapter 9 56 yes let me search it out real quick because if this if this what I'm thinking right now it could be that I wanted only from the chaptered oh yeah I'm uh I'm pulling up the chapter right now I'm gonna read it a word-for-word what you mean he says okay I'm on knife it's it's right now just a lady net land in the hand of the Marines I'd rather much take it for myself let's listen fall in the hands of the Marines yeah well dead of letting it land in the head of the Marines I'd rather much take it for myself you see I was thinking like what if it was like the national treasure no merger was but like that would be far no way that wouldn't be like it wouldn't be correct fires I don't think the Marines would know like of a such a natural tragedy is this it's not for doflamingo says he did know about it and like that's the reason why he was still empowered and like he roam freely you know Anna when not if it is what I think that could that could have been then it may have something to do with a a weapon you know I mean I'm a destruction and it could be sad blue like the headlines could have said anything from Sabo having to do a pluton to just sample dying to just sample in the national treasure or something fighting an admiral or something like that so be is a very real possibility and speaking of the news what do you think of big hands Morgan oh man Morgan's fader news Morgan's like throwing hands Morgan the fact that I just recently found out that he with his own it made it even more better just like imagine his hybrid form right because I was saying in my last video I just released a video today how strong is big news Morgan but I was sitting in the video I was shocked and I think everyone was shocked when no diff decipher poll agent even though the cypher poll what sacra Poli was from it wasn't specified it was kind of just like psycho poll agent probably CP 9 or CP 1 or C 2 or CP 3 like CPS 1 to 9 definitely not he's 0 because he didn't resemble a CCP zero agent right but Morgan's didn't even have a scratch on him and he just like it was evident that he was supposed to have like knocked him out just like one too you know what I'm saying but yeah the thing is I it was saying we shouldn't know because well especially when we found out he ate the tortora know me Marlowe Albatros he's always in his hybrid form let me know high performance the strongest form of the zone so we shouldn't know that he would be there a little bit but the biggest thing is he was introduced as one of the underworld bosses next to somebody like Stussy and Stussy is a pretty powerful cp0 agent so at the time we kind of just assumed he's only an underboss because of the influence and the knowledge he possesses not his strength but I think it was should have been a better parent that he knew how to fight at least somewhat and that makes me and that makes me not wanna like shy away from my you know dis only the fact that Orochi is seems to be a lousy character or know a goofy character just like just a goofy character and I feel like you should possibly be strong you know me I think a rope she is actually very strong I still actually think he might be throws and game and not he might be throws and game in not King because Orochi we know he's got that ginormous yeah that crazy down fruit it's not a smile right it's not a smile yeah it's just enough so when you got a eight headed snake dragon Devil food you got to be strong and they know when he saw sorrel coming at him he was like ah save me but you know then again one he could be trolling or two he could because the thing is like remember kids roux she's like uh when Ben Beckman pointed the gun at him and considers like ah Ben Beckman and Ray stands up now of course I think Ben Beckman is strong and bettan and was kind of a threat to kiss rule but you can't tell me that Ben Beckman had kids root and check me then kids rule could have taking them on through was just like I don't feel like fighting ha ha so kind of thing O'Reilly right right so I feel like it might be something like that with Roachy cuz oda has done many things there has only been one devil fruit he went he let go to enormous waste but the potential of the devil fruit wasn't really I'm not even sure owner realized the potential of his own devil fruit at the time the time talking about his waffles devil fruit because if you think about it if Walpole eats gluten the man becomes a living pluton that devil fruit was hacked but waffle had not obtained but you know the fact that odors like grow much more since the drum island arc and the fact that I wrote cheese down fruit as hyped up could be strong from the beginning I'm thinking about a rope should probably will actually be strong cuz I don't think Oda would let that big of a devil fruit that's strong enough of a devil fruit go to waste I'm curious to see a roach is Harvard from I know it's have we seen it nah what we saw it through I'm pretty sure we saw it through the curtains but I don't really count that as seen it it was just uh shadows and wonder how tough those snakes are no roaches back I wanted to take a carry likes big no swords or a katanas and like you know be more versatile getting like just attacking and grappling in I don't know right swallowing your would not you know me so you know black lady black leg then smoke hundred K subs texts channel probably not a good one piece channel out there I made he made a video saying that a rope she's gonna be an eight swords I'll user against arose um upgraded Astro nine sword style and I still think that's possibly can happen because the way Orochi was hyped up before I know I feel like Odin might be trolling us with the whole Iraqis a goofy weakling thing because Roshi he's got this hacked up flew as I said and he did I know was backed by Qaeda when he took over one oh he's still did take over wanna you know what I'm saying so yeah I'm thinking he it might be like a Maria thing where he used to be overpowered but he repressed and then as Ronald progresses forward he'll go back to what he once was at least for a little bit so yeah so I'm kind of think that might be what's up with the Roshi but I'm really hoping is rolled by to rotate and knocking because that'd be really hype didn't who I actually hope will fight King so I don't think nah I'm thinking whoa could be Sanji because then again like I'm thinking son if Soros if Orochi is like first tender if luffy became Janka level at figures or would probably become admiral level if we're just going by I'm comparisons but I'm not sure if orochi's admiral level or if Sir will be or if Louie will become York level but I'm actually thinking law might take on King because if you think about it lost over food so first of all law does use his Appa Appa no me but he is a pretty dang good swordsman you know what I'm saying yeah thank King he obviously uses fire and he flies around right and the laws W is the perfect counter to flying yes so I'm thinking that law might actually take on King but that's just not a very popular opinion by ice do you think there's not I mean it's not popular but it's very possible because we don't know who's gonna fade who or who's gonna catch the fade and I'm very very interested on you know what's gonna come next and alright I'm looking forward to like all the straw house fighting equally alternatives of I like having equal fights and like a heavy actual fights any bizarre and even if some more off-screen or put it put to the side you know I mean later I feel like we gotta see each individual parallel we got a seal I've seen on boost because same I feel like Chuck almost like choppers grown like fire though boost I don't like nominal fire at the booze but I feel like Oh sounds been working on nom his weapon a flight Frankie's probably worked on Mommy's weapon a little bit I'm not sure I feel like they both Frankie and boost I worked on Sanji's no race suit and uh I'm care to see what you stopped implants or this techno his technology in missing this weapons because like who's been on a back burner you notice that he has I'm thinking that okay so there's two things I always kind of wanted to see somebody eat at that devil fruit and I just went there two things know I kept praying for like please can you stops Kabuto eat a double food and Konami eat the you can you can owe me you can you can owe me with there's no snow fruit by the way we're completely salami and I think loose up several fruit not it was ops weapon hit like his slingshot having a double through will be pretty sick in a good power of um you know what no it's funny doesn't his devil fruit taking water to like grow oh yeah you right yeah I got bleep Boise what if he made a new weapon doe wait he made it completely new weapon and like he immigrated with a devil fruit yeah somehow that's true it'll be interesting so uh also Nami you think she'll eat the Yuki you Kaname where is it so she responded well here's the thing that you can you can owe me went on I said I'm pretty sure you've heard of this theory right I'm not sure Monay dies right there were two omma there were two things that there were two fruits close by there what are those apples that were completely overtaken by the gas and then there were girls then there was the tangerines on nominees orchard but I'm pretty sure it was closer than the apples so what a gone to either of those two so the big theory is that you go me jump for one of the tangerines and Ami's I'm Orchard oh I mean I know Nami is just like I mean I'm not gonna try I'm not trying to put it out there blade she's pretty much faster am i her like not have not being able so I take barrels and stuff like that it would be a disadvantage to her as a woman you know I mean and I feel like well I don't know I don't know if I would go that route I'm not or the editors maybe look no like not a design yeah like very strict I mean they're yes-man polite at the same time it's like yes but not they wouldn't want to go that far well you know with the yeses like no no Oda we need water we need water yeah I don't I'm not sure but then look at Rodman the day look at Robin you know I mean I didn't think about how the woman needs hockey and she's just right like what she wants hockey she'll go so far because just imagine her taking on but the thing with the straw hats is they all got to get some big power so because let's be real people want to act like this thing can happen but AOS they're gonna be Roger pirates level or above Luffy said that numerous times though they're all gonna have to even though it seems like just a bunch of plot and stupidity and dumbness right now oh right even if he does it by a ton of flowers it's gonna have to push them up to that level at some point and that's all a problem start in this arc yeah I feel like I was gonna find some way to incorporate everyone until I forming this big bad group you know like of you know bad arses and like I feel like we started is gonna have his final in his real moment to shine and like not you know not went on you know the fault no from no just from like I miss out our flights as you have a showdown work it's like to the like to the death like it's gonna be on the lines and like he's gonna prevail and like he's gonna win or it could go down the other route where he's you know I don't know yes well we're gonna status that's why we're gonna say like I'm not sure I want to go ever out justice I love loser no I'm new you know speaking of double flips in particular so do you know who monkey week is monkey reach her mother's win beep is he in be da or not he's this youtuber he's this anime youtuber who got types of channels he's got phantom man a hunter hunter channel with 13k subs monkey Rick 1p channels like seven point eight K subs or a K then he's got one seven deadly sins one my hair I'll kid he's just not a ton two channels but I made this video that went pretty viral that was talking about angel fruits and there just struck me I was like hold up there's devil fruits what if there was a no fruits what do you think of that like the last yield dragons be using the angel fruits against the devil fruit users and the celestial dragons don't eat devil fruits they eat angel fruits and they all have angel fruits are like all the high ranking ones have angel fruits or something like that what you think of that prospect it would be interesting it'll be like the Paris killer would shift completely if that was the case cuz I don't know how you would like GIP has a whole lot of fandom going any saint over angel fruits no I mean like people gripe over it I thought people will gripe over it to the death for them not me oh my why blow to do that what about to do that what about to do that even though he already introduced the time time fruit which can only go for an hour backwards thank God I'm just if ill boggle my mind if oh they actually I put angel in there at a time like this and like it changed the game completely I mean we still gotta get it go ahead I'll say maybe it would be something like there are only angel fruits but angel fruits are all but extinct except for one angel fruit and I'm Usama has it I think that a bit and I'll be crazy yeah cuz I'm curious to see and see if he or she actually has one and I'm also curious to see where are these now I mean like were they hiding if they're already here it's going to be the last island yeah because and also I just really hope we see Goofy's mom because everybody was saying Oda said should be ugly but apparently if the translation it seems like he was saying should be like Stern and almost like an ugly personality almost like Sakura always punching Naruto or something right Nami yeah like yeah yeah I kind of really want to see his love his mom yeah I wouldn't mind I was thought much about Lucy's mom I'm I'm not sure if she passed or not I'm not even sure if she cuz I know a dragon was like I cannot wait to see Luffy and dragon they ever Mino is and I can't wait to see like the interactions like his dragging just as goofy as Luffy underneath all that hard exterior or is he's I don't know cuz there was one panel I forget exactly what he said but he made a face that was exactly like Goofy's right I know right it was when I'm a koala was asking him like telling him about luffy dragon was like like that luffy bored face so i think that might actually be the case and on the subject of like dragons abilities or his connection with Lupe's mother or whatever I've tried to think of like theory surrounding all those things but until I was like you know what no matter how hard I try I'm credit list you know what I'm saying you're right your credit list when you get into those waters it's all speculation like even in my video when I was saying how strongest Morgan's the only thing we have to know is that he's got a devil fruit and he's uh you know what is an underworld boss I said in the video everything beyond this is speculation because sometimes it's a struggle but I try not to present my speculations as credible theories yeah I feel like good no I was just saying so dragon is a hard exterior luffy goofiness I definitely think as possible because I think we might have even seen a hint with that yeah um how do you feel about GART cuz like I feel like garb and Luffy are is very similar like they are I fly fly Luffy would go down a path of guard and not dragon you know I mean like I feel like Siddhartha is very intelligent and very intelligent but he's still look goofball that's it no no inside and like I just don't want to see the Luffy go down that his path as a man you know and good and his own path as a man you know me I don't want to see him I don't want to see him get all tough up no in front of his father I want to still be in know right maybe I'd be Hardy here right I mean we've always seen that Luffy deviates from the path of his family members like even Lucien even a subsample just look really one of the top commanders of a strongman salvos became one of the top commanders of a strongman Luffy goes and becomes these strongman you know what I'm saying yes so I was always kind of deviated from that and even though I think he still would be kind of a little bit similar to GARP like he'll cook Karpis goofy he just won't act tough because like when odor drew Luffy um when he's uh 40 years old the resemblance to GARP was definitely there you couldn't really see drag him but you could definitely see sharpen that based yeah I find that interesting that odors giving dragon emotions you know I mean like he was a bit worried of for Sabu and like we don't usually see that of dragon so it makes me wonder like who is dragon you know who is like who is the man yeah it makes you wonder it and it makes you makes you fight is a oda setting up dragon to be a you know a heart a heart hat or it's a year tough guy or is he a sensible guy he could be a sensible guy like Zurich oh you know I mean he could be hard but still care right and I feel like ever since ever since we found out that dragon I always face to the left or was it to left or the right whenever he was on on that one island that it got ransacked by the Marines because of cuz of uh to the who was it it was the champion guy Burgess Oh Burgess Burgess yeah yeah ever since dragon was looking towards the love where Luffy position was over in the east blue it makes you wonder are you really tough are you really alright he could be he has to be well he has to be like yeah he has an army I feel like he's sensible but still fun the loving if that makes sense yeah I agree I agree like like like like Zeff like myself I feel like I feel like he will fit into the world he has to like you cannot have a character that just doesn't fit into the world Lumpy's you know me right but did you notice how koala was telling him off with the whole Luffy thing kind of resembling Nami telling Luffy off that's what I'm kind of thinking me probably is gonna be a bit you know less hard and tough than we think but he's gonna have the intellect he's gonna have rather like the ability to lead the ability to toughen up when need be but when he doesn't need to toughen up he's not gonna necessarily be that hard imposing Manion that's kinda what I'm thinking dragon might be right now but of course we need more information later on in the story as the story progresses that'd be very cool to see I hope we get to see that in a very soon I would say oh I wouldn't say like oh we get to see the light Laird I mean like very soon cuz like it's very important so I not deviate enough by too far away from what we just seen and my I know we're gonna go back to LA no I know we could go back to one oh but like are we gonna see a little bit more else the revolutions are we gonna see a little bit more buggy night on the Warlord's or the formal war alerts are we gonna see more Kobe or are we getting Hawks bounty yes are we gonna see batteries so hoping for his bounty put the whole warlord anime shows huh what the anime shows it instead that it'd be a bit stupid I feel like because I mean it took a little bit longer till I see it's left out by I don't know because I feel like in that chapter anime shows up at the month it doesn't everybody's gonna be saved not Canon belty not Kanan bounty right right yeah you're right you're right I feel like in that chapter there was a lot of uh there was there was a lot of time going back and forth you know I mean yeah like like it was like time segue towards like the next the next part I feel like they were just gonna fill it out I feel like they're gonna have to fill it out in the anime like they're gonna show like multiple scenes getting flushed out but I don't feel like they're gonna show the newspaper though and like I don't know where it's coming know where it's gonna go at the end of it you know just gonna wait the next chapter and luckily there's no break yeah Oh Hulk there's no break it like I was shocked oh is it a break between acts but like we saw this with chapter 9 25 it just went from the world of war notebook rest of the world then went back to one oh I think that's what's gonna happen next chapter and we might get more be like insight on what can happen at the beginning of act 4 so that's summer look or - and I was gonna say something else that was pretty big but I can't remember what it was oh I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry no no that was hitting you I my mind just kinda just thought a lot like I'll be thinking of something to say but because I'm thinking of it I won't remember it yeah well I'll forget it as I'm beginning to say it that's what it more yeah but similar yeah yeah I feel that I definitely definitely feel that but Kobe so what's the whole sword thing like how strong you think the sword even it is it depends on like how deep it is like he's like gotta be you know a part of that as well probably like you did I mean a monkey D family thing you know what I'm saying they're much more kind of hard hitters cuz even if even though dragon did kind of you stuff to save Luffy from buggy but I feel like that was probably I guess dragon is kind of a stealth guy with seem to I can do a lot of stuff things but like l\u00fathien are definitely they're not the stealth type of person okay how do you feel about him elbow being real like right now I'm not sure blight even if they didn't show even if they did showing him up Oh like how do you feel about him being a rare animal I'm right next to Kobe so here's the thing with Hema Pope I actually made a theory about it a while back was called rose marina rival I feel like if Xaro has a marine rival it's gonna be helmet though because we know that helmeppo uses his cope ash or khopesh I think the code let me just see I think they're called khopesh Zorro said are not khopesh it was like I forget what it was but it was that weird shaped sword and Zorro whoa it takes a man of those are hard swords to use like saying how my PO you got skills to be able to wield those and helmet Poirot go as far back as being Kobe as loopy when looping back Kobe that was around the time zero and helmet promet and helmet ho had sorrow crucified up on the like had him crucified up there so the fact that there he goes that far back and their beef goes that far back I feel like helmet post gonna kind of be trailing just behind Kobe so he's gonna also be fighting Zorro like sometimes maybe not like equally was all but he's probably gonna definitely be fighting Zorro since they got that much history and they're all even acknowledged to swordsmanship briefly yeah so that I see if I feel like Alma Poe if he's a real Admiral that's um I don't think that's out of left field I think that's a reasonable thing to happen how do you feel about him uh pose hockey bloomin and like oh yeah I think it's time I think it's about time that it happened because like if Kobe's a rare animal already I since nano3 since chappy 903 and like it's re skyrocket like to two ranks up I feel like it's time for him up a little just get a third branch no but then I it puts me in it ya know I keep going keep going it puts me in a position to wonder like wait no like where's the she in all of this Westland odors yeah I'm gonna be throws girls now I'm not gonna say well maybe I don't know but it was a Kobe's rate of growth from the time skip is equal to that of leafies kind of but looky what your store any stronger than him from the get-go I feel like Yoda might have has kind of mess copy up a little bit because I feel like when Kobe met Luciana on a water seven and at marineford he should have had it so that Kobe was stronger and relation to luffy then he was because now anyway Kobe catches up to Luffy whatever the reason that will say that will mean that Kobe's rate of growth is stronger than Luffy you know what I'm saying yeah so I feel like that was kind of like a battle noticed part of course I'm up a mangaka but that's just one thing about Kobe well this was a great scream but I'm gonna have to wrap it up I got some things to do it was a fun fun yeah yeah was the front string it was a streamer I would just I just had it had like a quick thought in my head like what if Kobe's like Brady level in fishing or swimming he's already I mean like what if he's Rayleigh level in swimming Oh like I think that's a pretty possible thing ssam swimming like he are rocking out here you thought I say yeah I did yep I actually kind of put copia doflamingo level and a lot of people are saying what's your issue bro or maybe not maybe not doflamingo level but I was there under so I feeling like Kobe's oriano right because the thing is Kobe's going to have to make a giant hop that seems like plot and unrealistic at some point like he's gonna have to do it sometime because of the way order has set him up so Kobe's telling us do that at some point can we speak on the right now beautiful about Coco be like surprise nice on you yeah yeah I I think he's passed charge already just read sit sorry I mean what I'm just saying like I mean it's very possible yeah I think so yeah I think Kobe's I honestly think Kobe stronger than lots of vice-admiral's he's fresh Oh stronger than a main heart and Bastille right but I think it's the theory that sword is kind of quote-unquote good Marines within the Marines like a coalition of them if that theory is correct and what makes sense that Kobe's only rear admiral if the people like a kind who are taunting him because they don't like because they don't like sword or sword was originally just a marine blue but sore has kind of grown has they have say sort has very strong ideals about the Marines and changing the Marines members of my sword might be being stunted every that could be a possible thing so yeah and then the whole thing with Col will be wait what we're saying about Kobe it just slipped out my head Kobe being like Rayleigh level in swimming yay or he's climbing he's climbing close to Rayleigh level in swimming like he'll bit he'll be able to take on Sea Kings like in no turn I feel like well I think he already can't probably my meds can swim yeah well facing the sea Kuna Sea Kings aren't honestly that share aha she would be Opie it's because of the sheer number it's almost like Sea Kings it's like Sea Kings are strong but once you get like even a little bit drum like Bartolomeo his barriers could take on a seeking I'm not trying to see once he kings cuz I know one bit all shanks arm but like let's be real that was a bit the breeze of the Sea King bit how shanks arm was because one shanks gave it up for the new generation I know but I think the biggest reason was that it was the first chapter of the series and things were completely fleshed out yet no it's crazy yeah shanks saves Luffy in the beginning and shanks stays with Kobe my in the turning point oh you write you write that never girl like oh how do you know why I like Kobe's been climbing up the ranks and like ever since I yes oh you're right my boy he has to have like a D copy I have like a D or something like come on his parents were like pirates right and we're not like what's his parents pirates or in the beginning I forgot that Kobe's parents are pirates I'm not LA I went that Frankie because I remember Frankie parents apart but I think Kobe parents were not good people I don't believe I don't remember that that might have been the thing I'm I know I'm going to the one piece wiki cuz people hate on the wiki the wiki can't trip but let's be real the wiki also is like um big fans like you or me who are just trying to type what they saw in the chapter so if I go into the history past I'm not seeing anything about his uh oh yeah here I'd intended to board a ship for a fishing trip or a fishing trip but he caught on the wrong ship I'm not seeing anything about his a pair oh wow okay okay ye I'm pretty sure his parents probably found that he's a marine and probably happy for them but yeah is this all we got it's just all the time we got a bear I'm like I'm let your and it I this was this was a doe stream I feel like we could've kept going yeah we could but other mami papi - right yeah stream - I don't know when he's

piece one piece is looks good and today we're live reacting to chapter 958 now I haven't seen any spoilers or how you haven't even heard any reviews of the chapter I've just avoided all the talk of chapter 958 so I don't know what to expect I can kinda guess that it's not gonna be as hype as 9:57 or 956 but I'm still expecting some up his some you know some relative heat just let me respond to the job real quick but uh of course I got my Shazam hoodie right here I know we DC for hands up in here but you know just like you know the whole eco to you know saying okay let's get into the chapter the chapter is called the promised port so I'm gonna assume it's got something to do with the port they're trying to launch off to onegai shima from the port because I heard a Orochi in the last chapter if I recall correctly he heard all they plans so let's do this okay so the cover page is uh Lola it still the gang pages oh my family vol 8 so he's looking at it and they were telling Lola and not when they're telling chef on a mage your sister Lola wasn't dressed Rosa a few days though so you know that's what was meant so let's start this gesture so no no ho bro we're getting the flash back already it's gonna be old and I can see cuz it's a sailing on the calm sea not long before the start of the great era I'm glad I joined you Roger we're getting no time boys I can't believe we're seeing Roger again I don't think that uh Roger I don't ever seen like Roger just interact with people like in a flashback I'm pretty sure besides chapter zero and his execution we haven't seen him do any like talking and interact scene and just being himself and from the looks of this he's kind of like just like a goofy personality he's a kind of drunk right now so that just kinda is cool cuz that's a bit of a milestone for the story because like Murphy Roger thought this is actually an - he's talking Odin so what's all this sentimental crap you softie we're the ones who should be grateful Odin so yeah he is talking Odin and then the croquettes it's like you've had too much booze Roger we need to learn some restraint and then Rogers like attacking him like going up against him he's like shut up I don't need to hear that from the biggest Trump of drunk on the ship so yeah they kind of have a straw hat like dynamic okay so let's go into Chapter four oh mercy buggy and shakes I've been rail ace like one land lend me a hand oh and I really hope we can see what it looks like then shanks for Bucky like I'll help to Odin's an you just get in the way idiot that's what shank says so bunky says I'll help you to Odinson and shank says you'll just get in the way you idiot okay so let me help instead Odin side so Jay so they don't like oh and I'm like ray lays trying to get on Odin's good side and boggy and shanks are both trying to get on Odin's good side so he can tell from this that Odin is gonna be a very charismatic character and a leader in somebody like you you want to be around somebody you want to like you so I really hope we get to see what he looks like for showing it this side so he says rail a red car Oh bookie Giro I appreciate it but there is an internal matter for the Kisuke clan because shanks red car oh and Bucky Bucky Darrow and then really just Rayleigh and then common Japanese this is just an under note common Japanese male endings typically taro first son in hero second son oh so he's calling buggy the inferior one [ __ ] legs get burned clown because like but he is a legitimate clown so like this is kind of cool that he like he's calling buggy the second son so buggy it's like how many times have to tell you to stop calling me Jiro I never understood why wha know had to be closed up to the boarders outside of the world seeking to become Shogun after thoughtlessly abandoning my home and maybe selfish of me but I would definitely make what I have from vision to reality oh man so they are just gonna be still casting that silhouette on Otis not showing us his face that's kind of annoying but okay I'm certain that with the aid of my reliable retainers I will be able to open what\u00f5s borders we shall oversee the fruition of this 20 year old dream you can do it Odin I will Roger so that's cool we got a flashback and we see Roger interacting and talking Odin even though it's really really annoying we didn't get to see his face like I was kind of hoping for that not opening what word is opening I was hoping for that you know what I'm saying so let's just get into the next page because now it's doing the whole musicians Act three it's like a play like you know I've said about three 25 years have passed since that day so he said a 20 year old dream which means that that was probably five years before kind of pulled up and all that so now we just got the wall no country act three and the curtains are opening removed to haku my so port happily this step for Apple so we got a road sheet a row she's like the weather is splendid today this must be a good omen from the gods moo-ha-ha so that is Rho cheek laughs I always loved about one piece that characters would have their own unique laughs and we got Orochi apparently his unique glasses Moo ha ha ha or Moo ha ha ha whatever it is and I just kind of like the laughing distinction so we got a Rocha with a Moo ha ha ha and he's like what a perfect day for a banquet and then of course all his jesseman are like Lord Oh true Orochi deserves it so then we got that I completely forgot his name like the leader of the 11 ninja with the N rue earlobes and the way to call forehead like what's his name I don't remember what he is I don't even remember i write the ninja are called the overwhelming oh no why don't you but I don't remember and that guy's name specifically I'll have to remember that later but he says Kyoto will be looking after the capital in our abs let everyone know so Kyoto he'd been taking care of the capital stuff yes sir I'm lucky for him he cannot participate in the banquet now this is the largest port in mono it is surrounded by huge sea walls lined with beautiful maple trees Lorna Road she please have a safe journey take care there's bright red leaves dance in the wind bidding farewell to the ships so what kind of getting the novel feel so we're seeing Orochi ship sailing down with people with leaves floating around it and all these people cheering him off Roshi he's just taking up the cloud he's eating that cloud up you know what I say so bring the booze let us make a toast to the maple trees Lord Orochimaru Kaito oh he's going to be kind of yeah let's go well it was finally taking off after two acts people to act it's finally taking off let's get into this goodness bro I can't wait like in 20 chapters cuz like if you think about it the Kairos Dragon reveal was a year ago and I sight time has passed so fast so like in a year from now like I can't wait for the hike we're gonna be doing like I know there's a ton of theories Luffy versus kind of leaf he will have like go wood hockey or something like that I don't know what will happen but it's gonna be right so a row she's like there is no need there is no need he probably started drinking himself a bank but for 40,000 people this year sure is to be a delay like always once a year onegai shima the two supreme leaders who over 100 meet face to face and hold a bake but for their armies so I know a lot of people are thinking Orochi ish crash and i know like when saul was going for him he was all like me but I'm kind of feeling like Odom might be trolling that's a bit like I feel like I wrote with you might actually be strong and he might actually be a troll kind of like his rule because like look at that devil fruit and the height peace receive the army he commands they know yet kind of backing him but he it's not like a rote she didn't do anything himself wasn't all these pirates was my take on it so I feel like Rocha might be strong but just be a troll so meanwhile at the flower capital drinkin sink to your heart's content today is the Capitals fire festival today is the only day we are allowed alcohol bring all your drinks with you and come buy some candy apples come on hurry now it is starting wait my hair's not a place is that Nami oh I think that's just a random chick okay let's dance what clear skies these are just random people by the way seems like we won't be able to see a beautiful moon full moon tonight well guess what but you are not boy I guess it's go but guess what girl you're not gonna be seeing no beautiful moves tonight you're gonna be seeing war tonight yeah so I don't think the fire festival is gonna be the final battle but he definitely believed it's gonna be like the first phase of the battle and a pivotal role in the one Oh art I need to stop talking as much let's just go do the chapter and wanna know that season and wanna know the seasons can vary vastly depending on the region and the weather is no exception this means that the climate can be extremely unpredictable also she's saying mostly food for mood tonight not only will you see war tonight you will probably be seen rain and were judged off of that why no country you dogs we a nude are now at the rendezvous point for the final battle crackle so we asked raining and thundering oh we got the night scabbards wait 1 2 3 4 5 6 so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so we got seven of seven of the nine scalpers wait issue noble a nice guy friend I just yeah Shinobu let me search that up Shinobu and i know the one piece of wiki isn't only liable but they should be able to know that I don't know why I just like I feel like you know who's probably a nice camper but I just completely forgot let's just hit up the wiki real quick if she what that why did it go to homepage Oh she was in the owner why virtue of the Kazuki Shogunate oh yeah now I remember she's not a knight she's not a nice Gabbard ok sorry let's just get back into this so we got um rise oh not a single ship in sight so that dang cat didn't make it in time right so of course now come on machine yet and then um what's his face I don't know I forgot a saying in Arras he said that we were definitely able to secure him we were definitely able to secure Adan oh so the person of the samurai armor is that dang trap Teague so actually I made a video a while back o'kiku is not a man and it was saying like that people in that time period girls to a dress up as men and say there were men so they could get positions of power but I know this is the way Odin rule is she's definitely a trap but that thing you did get one point 6 K views oh yeah we were definitely able to suit on it's so annoyed even through her day or his whatever even through his dang mask he still looks like a girl his mask literally is a demon mask with teeth and he still looks like a girl but he's owed up I'm still kind of triggered about that you know that I still got it you get about that okay so what this is up Carlebach see that's his name I can't believe my brain is like I just got back from a ton of classes so I like was heavy a Python programming class my brain is all a bit disoriented you know saying but calm others like but none of this order no you know I'm just gonna start from the top of the pages I messed it up so much oh wait I just realized I even skipped a panel what's wrong with me okay so there stay standing in front of the ocean seven of the nine scabbards then we got Shinobu and uh mama no escape behind them and then she no boots like crying and she's like Tiananmen this is the possible then mama no skis like we should change today get him on and can mantra slick then Rises likes not a single ship in sight so that dang cat didn't make it in time we were

explanation there's still a small boat here though it looks usable what are you doing in ER Arashi so that's what in Arusha said about the boat stop this foolishness at once so that's what mama knows gets at the inner ah she then ona gosh MA what exactly did Orochi scheme up event a road she's laughing last night an incident occurred and her oh she's with all his like girls and stuff oh what the chap dragon knows only 14 pages usually they're like fifteen or sixteen right what happened to this right this hasn't really happened to more people for because I watch the anime for a long time until I switched the manga in the whole cake island arc but correct me if I'm wrong but there hasn't really ever been a thing where the whole straw hat crew just disappeared and an incident happened to said straw hat crew and we weren't present with them like the straw hats disappearing like even Luffy the freaking main character like it off-screen Luffy disappeared off screen there was a fight with Luffy our screen like a whole fight like the old that was an interesting chapter I give it a 7 out of 10 I like the flashback in the beginning and then I like to help they're just starting to roll the ball slowly roll the ball and so things start just throwing bows the full-steam down I'm kind of excited or not necessarily excited but interested to know what did happen to the straw hat crew since it was all screened but yeah this was my reaction I know it wasn't as crazy as the last one cuz the last one I was just like wow just screaming my head off but yep that's it for this reaction just for my next chapter prediction I think we're kind of getting get an insight on what did happen to try a crew I figure we're probably gonna switch the what's the word switch perspectives to the triack crew we're gonna go do the straw hat crew and leave the nice gabbard's is my prediction so yeah I'm down here uh let's get this back to bow back on because why not we creamed up in here we're cringe so yeah thanks for watching all right I just read the chat Shaz my boy Chaz he says probably hint of a traitor to and yes you right cuz I forgot about the traitor that makes a lot of sense the traitor sold them out cuz well like I know the traitor sold them out to roachie mended traitor probably led them to a place like made it so that it was easier for Orochi to catch catch them on top of just the you know giving them information to Orochi so yeah Shaz thanks for that little insight and yeah thanks for watching if you enjoy my content or these uh weekly chapter life exs dreams and a few Dharma

of flies would only last a few minutes three the flies would only land on pharaoh's overseers four all of the above", "sc1qlN6uAIE": "the answer that question of course is one piece one piece is what's good and today we're gonna be life yaks into one piece chapter 957 let's go now I heard from the people who read the spoilers that this chapter is better than chapter 956 which is a pretty hard thing the top but this is good and we're talking about so let's get in it oh there's also one piece chapter 950 6.99 go check that out too so the chapter is called ultimate I like that I like that was oh okay so we got that's not called the cover page but the weekly shonen jump cover Luffy and chopper Nami Nami Scott at Matthew he's got some candy and top hat well I guess they all got like this weird candy thing but we got another cover page thing there's loot biani goose gets called pick up your speed and all the straw hats are on it it's like this goose rollercoaster ride with the turtle and a turtle on top of that turtle next to them so I guess that was the cover page oh we're back at Marion HQ so I was thinking it was gonna be like act 2 where we just went right back to uh oh I know after um 925 we went to Blackbeard and all that stuff but then we went straight back to one oh but apparently we're still in the marina HQ let's go oh you must be satisfied if soul food or I've been waiting for this dude okay so you must be satisfied it so I'm assuming this is the kind knew the abolition of 4/7 warlord system with your goal after all we never saw eye to eye on it but the kings that the world have spoken so it is that Kazuki talking you still think the warlords were necessary despite all the sacrifices we had to make for their sake so this is food you're right now it must it must be because you've never personally suffered under them Oh dispute or a history with the world look Oh food before God bandages so I guess when he was fighting with the revolutionaries he was picking up them scars you know I'll say ok you got scars on me alright some future tours like let's just put our face in the SSG going forward the ballot the power balance of the world will definitely be shaken so who are the SSG oh I can't believe you got scars bro or bandages we all know we already knew we had scars okay has it occurred to that it might change for the worse this is a kind new now apparently Amano bigmar Mankato have formed an alliance and through the doors like say what and they're all like what does this mean the rocks have returned all right cuz big mom kinda weren't the same proves it like big mom and Qaeda Foreman Alliance does this mean that's around oh my goodness Shaz my voice - shut up - shares he says you're not ready for the chapter I know I'm not I'm feeling the hype right now bro I am feeling this like you know I'm saying okay legend can do it shut up stop talking you must read this [ __ ] chapter okay what does this meet the rock-solid return stop talking like there's some kind of legend oh man I'm just right stop talking like there's some kind of legend this is the if this is reality we're facing here for this tapping one we're so busy what a disaster I've got to see Caillou two of the Emperor's allies it just had to be now of all times for the report stated the Alliance is only tentative at this stage has have been any damage done yet but we have no idea what they're planning and we have no countermeasures prepared either truth we know almost nothing about the legendary rocks pirates so they keep they know nothing about the rocks pirates well I thought God took them out so they're feeling like since Big Mama Cano joining up like that's gonna mean that the rocks are gonna come back right now old man broken Dawkins's he fell off if they won't be these the chapter oh man shout out to all the people in the chat but oh my goodness I'm annoyed right now okay hmm big mom cut off the rock big mom and Kato had been fighting like cats and dogs from years no one could have foreseen this very few Marines are familiar with the name rocks nowadays many years ago on the pirate island beehives many significant individuals came together to seek a quick path to unfortunate so I guess they came together and beehive is where Blackbeard it moves now right so black you take over the former territory if the rocks that's pretty late you know I'll say okay that meeting led to the formation of the rocks pirates they weren't violent killing both friend and foe alike oh so they savage its members included white beard big mom Kaito and their youth they were led by their captain rocks white man okay I know that they said white beard was in the rocks I like I wasn't completely sure if that was confirmed or not but light beer within white beard was killing friends and foe alike that don't sound like the white beard I know you know a thing and all that marine guys are like what so we can see young big mom because young Kaito young white beard and then DC some other dudes indeed those three used to say on the same ship and the means are like unbelievable many others who sailed under the rocks also eventually made a name for themselves such as the golden lion she was under the rugs too and God took this man out God took tell a man who lied white beard oh wait beard cheeky big mom the silver axe captain John Inoue shoku so captain John's silver accent otaku I'm not sure we know about those guys maybe they were in a movie or something so choke ooh this is not um what you saying but this is like the under captions known as Wang Zi in Chinese with a real Chinese pirate Lord from the 16th century okay are you serious and how come all of this isn't common knowledge these are the means to San Goku's teaching San Goku well the one reason is that most of the members couldn't stand each other so they down ployed they downplayed their exploits as a group their captain rocks strive to become king of the world they were basically a terrorist group baring their fangs at the world government so wait hold up bro white beard was on a group of this savage okay now I'm starting to think maybe young white beard wasn't the real man he was that marine bird he probably mellowed out and stuff oh so the government covered up their actions which is another reason but back then their name was known throughout the world 38 years ago a fateful incident occurred I don't place no alley on that day the fate of that fateful day this trunk is pirate crew in the world perished on that day the strongest pirate crew in the world bro silver a shitty this silver axe man like bro I'm getting so hyped in God Valley like I'm getting nard to buy but you know I'm saying the final valiant stuff oh you know I said oh my goodness oh I think I got six viewers right now that's crazy okay the incident was big news there and stuff boo evil rampage which sampled all in their wake was finally quote by vice-admiral does my man okay we see a young guard picture he's covered in blood my man garden he'd be taken out he'd taken our crew with white beard cheeky big mom and dad Oh what the heck okay after the incident garbs name rev okay and people are still saying guard present you live or pirate can level at least prime carbon I mean like they're still saying front guard a pirate king of laughter okay after the incident garbage name rev reverberated across the world that house in that is how he became known as hero of the Marines well I can see why you know okay so that's what happened Vice Admiral guard has many acts of heroism under his belt however he doesn't like talking about this one in it particular huh why he'll acknowledge it if you ask him about it Big Mama uh I went back page although that was oh wait man okay wait okay held knowledge if you ask him big mom and Kato things keep going from bats worst the biggest reason is why he allied with the pirate during that battle although that was never reported okay props yeah I must say the pirate yeah led with was Roger you know what I'm saying better be a bit um better be a Roger a pirate there was another reason though he had to protect their celestial dragons during that mesh ha the celestial dragons were involved well isn't it our duty as a murder it's not to be as Marines to serve the celestial dragons a sense of morality never allowed him to believe that the main reason God always rejected the titles Amaral is because it would have made him a direct subordinate of the celestial dragons oh it's not make sense because I remember GARP was saying things like he was saying things like I don't want to be a Vice Admiral because then it has to do paperwork but that was the real reason apparently his popularity and achievements are probably the only reason why they did it haven't disposed of him for his attitude so I was thinking this D'Alessio guys might want to kill him GARP and Roger and couch dude each other on the island and teamed up to defeat the rock pirates so I was right it was Roger my man okay all in order to protect the select you dragons and their slaved during what is now known as the god Valli incident he fought alongside the Pirate King what a rogue all the celestial dragons Roger and the rocks what exactly was on the island I've never even heard of the place the island of God Valley is no longer drawn on the maps twirled the truth of the matter is after that incident guard Valley disappeared without a trace an island that the world government wanted tide wiped from the history books do you really want to know more about an island like that rocks ambition to become king of the world meant he was involved with many of this worst Abreu subjects that's why there isn't much information on the rocks anymore however I am sure about those memories are lying dormant in the minds of veteran Marines even though it's all in the past it still seems unbelievable that there was a man capable of leading three of the four emperors he was probably Rogers first and four he was probably Rogers first and most formidable rival so that's like more formidable than white beard yo what's going on even he may have been known throughout the ages as the ask captain rocks but his true name was rocks the Xebec so we know the rocks mean we know the rocks name we know the rods captain's name rocks the exhibit he may no longer be amongst us but he is one of the view with the initial D who have appeared from time to time while it's true that Big Momma Kaito were part of the crew in the past they are now much stronger than they were thirty eight years ago if they have truly formed an alliance then it may lead to the formation of the worst pirate crew in the world brand new what are their current bounties no they're not they're not gonna reveal the valleys they're not just working on updating bounties of those who have been stripped of the world Lord status so be male revue they sounding that well the first man who became an emperor one year ago black beard as a result of his attack on improve down he was able to recruit very powerful subordinates it's the current ruler of pirates Island behind his influence is continually spending and he's slowly overtaking white beard as a force to be reckoned with the Amaral of the black be pirates marshals eat each bounty toothed billion for two hundred forty seven million six hundred millions we knew that the next no no they're not they're not revealing that piece they're not they're not member we should discuss is this man he was recognized as a number six years ago and it's the youngest of the four his subordinates trust him greatly his executives are all big names that Beckman no they're not they're not really only tanks bound II don't don't think me focusing hi it's my wish a monkey would be four billion I'm about the diagram no crew are you are you serious so I guessed his bouncer would be four billion so it's 4 billion 48 million nine hundred thousand or nine hundred or four million sorry for 48 thousand nine hundred oh man I sounded I'm shrinking like a little girl oh my goodness okay we're on we have the natural-born sister where we said to have lifestyle a village or the island of Chinese el bass when she was a mere child freezing to trust anyone other than her own bloodline she founded the country of cuddlin running that ruling over it with her 85 children she's queen of the kingdom of sweets for Billy 318 million belly Big Mama Charlotte Leland oh I'm gonna die out get up shook kylos necks cutting that boys and last but not least Kaito parently does have to forget about me the last but not least this man although she was only up interpret only an apprentice when you switch rocks hard he was able to rally ready infamous Marines do his banner pirates not Marines thanks she was sheer strength and became an eye friend across Kaito the governor-general of the be spires please don't be far million stinkin hundred eleven million what I said for many billion six hundred eleven million one hundred or something let's go back to big mom cuz I think I screwed up about the four billion three hundred eighty eight million how depressing I'm sweating oh my goodness I avoiding I'm going to die here I am going to die take a chill pill don't die like I legit strain my chest from this like my chest is legit straight now huh I am alleged sweating on so hot like haha my is like laser point how depressing from here on out it's no longer you seven lower words I said weapon against the effort for course we'll have to see how the SSG from special marine science Marine Force performs before we can determine whether a move of the poison former ranks with wise children under Laden relative these were the bounties are the legends of the previous era I predict about it why baseball team predicted why big bounty would be 700 million but I mean 7 million but I mean 7 billion but in five billion if they show Rogers frumpty I swear I swear I will die right now I won't collapse and die and my soul will go to heaven or whatever if they reveal Rogers bounty I swear that I swear I'm gonna die no casting up the Roger pipes what see 5 million 4 million 8 so it helped me my lunch they're gonna Oh oh when they said this chapter was gonna be a gold chapter I didn't expect this dough of a chancer oh it's the best my Gaga of all time no single pirate has ever surpassed the gravities of these two however if Kay don't Big Momma Lyons comes to fruition there are combined LT will exceed them both they're currently in one a country that is unaffiliated with the world government they are fleet Ambrose and Kazuki we're leaving were no alone Oh Satsuki barged in and they're like slid Admiral Texas ooh things like we're leaving one alone we don't have the resources to divert their son gok\u00fb son of course I had no intention of interfering I only wanted to pass my knowledge onto this new generation of Marines even pirates are capable of developing relationships with one another that just have a motive behind them but cannot hope to predict the future when they are anything of the past speaking of which there is a PI Amano that white beard Roger and red hair favorite wait speaking of which there was a pirate in one oh that white beard wait I'm confused he said there was a pirate in the one oh that white beard Roger and red haired Shane's favorite wasn't there you meet Kazuki Odin he used to be a division commander on white bishop he was poached he eventually he was poached by Roger to accompany him on the pirate king sign of voyage this current situation couldn't possibly have had anything to do Oh Dan could it well it doesn't seem like I wanna know who's coming factor for well doesn't it seem like Rana was coming back the Frog those big shots it's a bit too much of a coincidence don't you think ah Kazuki and the chat friends the chapter ends I need more I need more okay so my brain is a craving empty stomach of what I need more information Oda go download it go say that the lowest oh wait no black widows but I was saying that black Ridge bounty is that low probably because of the fact that the only person the the strongest person he's defeated that we know of to justify his bounty as a Marco so if Marco's Brown sees like 1.8 billion and then black bear defeat and he's the strongest person Blackbeard has to feed it and then just for you black bear be miyako you stuffed it would be a little bit over Marcos so that's probably wise Brown T is that big but or that low all my goodness I got a headache bro I gave myself a stinking headache that Chavez goat best chapter of one piece ever more golden more golden gear for revealed more golden gear 2 and gear 3 revealed more goat sin kaido's devil fruit revealed more goat than anything reveal more goats than anything I know I'm a fourth you know kid got nothing better to do than have a stinking heart attack over a chapter but this chapter was too much like I can barely see from the holy light emanating from this computer screen go to ah I'm gonna die I'm gonna die is there anyone in the chat he wants to come up in the stream and discuss it for just a couple minutes you don't gotta if nobody wants to that's cool I can end the stream on such a good note as this but if any of y'all wanna come up in a stream I'm cool with that I'd like that so any of those want to be on this saying the chat I'll give you a couple minutes while I just try and get my act together from it's amazing laughter okay Susie boys let's keep popping I'm gonna give I'm gonna give this man the link and z-boy finna pop in here and and we and we gonna have some fun discussed in this chapter um uh like broke the chapter was like compared to the other chapters this chapter was like filet mignon and the other chapters are McNuggets okay you know what I'm saying like I have given myself a headache from this you know I'm saying like a legit headache I'm sweating like a pig I am sweating like a pig I just want to confirm if this is for you let me go back on the boundaries bro let me go back up the bounties I feel like I just ran a 10k you know I'll say I feel like I just fainted thinking okay let's go back Oh shakes has to Louis brownie of the yonk oh that like not Louis but like you know I'm saying a black Beard's the whole Marco thing the whole Marco thing with Blackbeard like how Marco's the strongest person he defeated so that'd be wise bouncy solo so shanks has the lowest bounty of like Diaco four billion 48 nine hundred forty billion 48 million nine hundred thousand nine hundred million nine hundred thousand yeah being moms 4 billion 388 million million yeah four billion six hundred eleven million 100,000 white Fiat 546 million goal the stinkin Roger five billion five hundred sixty-four million eight hundred thousand and we got the boy I've been here yeah there's not a tear that there's another ten Thanks big about the title belty Blackbeard baozi fraud bounty we all ready for Roger bounty wipe your bounty the name of the rocks captain like I'm hyperventilating up in here you know I'll say this chat is ghost Iceman this chapter is but I think in this hiked over this chapter is understandable oh yeah yeah I'm there okay do you what do you think so the thing is the yonk about some kind of what I expected I thought shanks Panther would be four billion because um and then pink mama kados would be it was worth it was right I know but I was saying I thought his thoughts would be the highest because of what that paper said with that like newspaper hinted but guess what he actually has the lowest precise Blackbeard yeah I was the only thing I was hoping for with a mihawk bounty reveal you know saying oh yeah I know people in be Diego the de shanks fanboys are salty right now you know that's my honestly those shanks you know I said he was like yong-chol less time to them right and you know Plus as well big mom she big mama Calder known you know they're more commonly to like go around the cause destruction that shanks this but I also increases their bounty that you remember kid he had a bounty part partly because you know he calls chaos civilian and yeah like how strong how strong was rocks to have three onco rhythm to you up in there too bro cannon well we knew she was cannon because the thing is we knew she was cannon it's just that none of the things that happened in the movies he was in we came in so like shaky cuz remember one piece chapter zero or episodes you know that's cannon so the black nation is bought both from GARP and San Goku and destroyed half of marineford is cannon and the fact that he was impelled down and escaped that's okay because that was from chapter zero but then everything else isn't right and the Battle of Ed war is also can but like grow like shake it you watch cheeky white beard Gartner carts are shaky white being a blurb was high noon yeah wipe your big mom card oh then you got Garth and Roger teaming up to defeat the rocks this rocks the exotic like this man bottle you Beast I also wanna people in the crew free that I'm thank you freezing I gotta go is that you froze by the way what you now you froze oh well I said I say plus one of the people from the crew was from being aborted people from the crew was from gorillas part right but what was his name which one of him was because I figured it was because the ones who were saying like the silver axe and stuff like I knew that we were probably supposed to know those guys but I couldn't remember who they was not not all of them I'm pretty sure looking up real quick I'm precious to one second second yeah the name second the Sheik am pretty sure he was from three other bar oh yeah I I can see I think well oh well it's just from oxidize I'm not seeing it just try looking up all cuz one of them I know Dilek works when I'd be alive they were naming off vehicle bounties I was so scared like I was about to die then when they said Roger when they said white beard I said I know they've been a not named Rogers stinking bounty you know I know what it was surprising because what I thought it was gonna do I thought it was just gonna name off the light the Warlord's unfroze bounties but then there's like do not see he's like I'm like Oh brownie I know like brah I was gonna die you knows it oh man this josh was crazy and I feel like I'm like just in my normal day-to-day life I'm usually not like this vibrant but I feel like there's just some people who saw me they just see me losing my mind over this to feel like what is wrong this kid taken to like those a psychiatrist or something oh I so God just like take a breath and just like okay so the UM guys for Golden Lion silver axe Captain John and otaku okay yo yeah yeah man I've just seen if I can find one of them yo you did yeah I'm back oh yeah yeah yeah I'm just seeing if I can find my come on what's a strain everybody let's train with it yeah there are two people left though but so the guy was Captain John the guy on thriller bark he was Captain John right so that guy like I feel like that this is the thing that going it does like these insignificant zombies on thriller bark will come back to be people who are on the same crew with white beard Kaido big mom she keep it you know I'm saying yes I would oh oh no will do like odo will have like of course act to all that setup Oda will have those like crazy boring chapters like that set up like ten chapters of setup but then you pulls things like this and you're just like okay it's all forgiven it's all forgiven just let me you know I'm saying yeah you made sure to land a lot chat was on for this thing right yeah okay I was in the chat yeah okay so it could be too though that a Big Mama Kyle and white bear just simply weren't as strong back then you know it could be true just wanted by second while I switch this hat but the day I got a question of is is why beer a lot more ruthless / evil than we think he was or or was Kyle and big mom not a bad back then because they said the rocks killed friend and foe alike oh yeah that's true in Mankato and shiki would do that's not something we really know the white beard we saw marineford what I'm saying it's like as I was I hold on like he's a party a crew like cuz it's what we be more of a savage back then you know I say right I calm down I'm not an insane psycho one-piece fan anymore I'm just the chill yo you just had a 5-1 piece uh dis chapter reaction I could not contain myself like I know some people might say he was just hyping himself up for the chapter but I like I thought she was playing a little bit cuz like there's no way you did height no I think I was height but I ain't do that bro I was like what the thing is me like usually I would I would get this type I may not scream as much what you really would hear like that like it's I just get extremely probably abnormally high over crazy one beauty chapters but yeah I kind of gotta do some stuff so I'm gonna have to cut the discussion here I just wanted a little bit of aftermath so people so we could just like you know chill out a bit and talk about it but I got some duties I gotta do so I'm gonna have to dip now butter but yeah great discussion stand out no a hundred out of ten chapter and yeah i'ma head out now see you in the next video peace and go to We Trust go let's do", "5eQt1dWI1cQ": "I'm a fan Swampy's fans what's good the answer that question of course it's one piece one piece is what's good and I don't know what the audio sounds right now because I was trying to make a video before with face cam but for some reason when I put both the face cam and the microphone into the laptop the audio just comes out horribly I don't know if it's doing that in the stream or not I guess I'll find out after it so if the audio is horrible I apologize for that but yeah so we're gonna be reacting to one piece chapter 959 I can't believe it's been that long since chapter 921 when kaido's power of there was like we were almost hitting the nine sixties boys and after that 979 80s next year we're gonna be hidden to thousands to think about that and about the time span from now that kaido's reveal his devil fruit reveal was we are going to be hating chapter 1000 just like get height for that you know what I'm saying so yeah we're just gonna be yeah live reacting to one piece chapter 959 so let's get it so I've been hearing mixed messages about this chapter I heard that it was made like I heard it was three out of ten in terms of mid Ness right it was very mid or I've also heard that was seven and was a good chapter so nothing outstanding but nothing bad either so it's cold samurai chapter 959 same ride so we got the beige on my family cover page we got entering battle-scarred dress roses so beige and uh chip on or and coming dressed rose trying to find Lola you know what I'm saying and I don't even know why Lola was in dress Rosa but that's pretty that's pretty cool um so we got two days before the final battle in total our forces are four thousand two hundred strong well done everyone so it seems like as I predicted we're going back to what happened before they disappeared so that's a pretty good thing that's pretty good well done everyone we should use this as Kinnaman talking well done everyone we should use the time we have left to prepare and start moving towards rendezvous point we shall meet at the promised port yeah alright let's err we have enough ships ready for 5,000 people that's Frankie yeah they're just going yeah we need to make sure our ships are in a position at the promised time alright you can count on us big bro France Kay and all the Carpenters are like yeah it's like everybody's hype and I wonder what's gonna happen we stop it's like okay we're heisting to a Mikasa village to meet up with the rest of the crew will be aboard their sunny for the final battle alright thanks for the help you two are amazing ships rights of course we are let's crush the B's pirates yeah just typical anime yes you know don't saying okay all around 100 Cho is bringing in the weapons from Ringo gather anything that can be used as armor here I do not know these are usable or sorry I do not know if these are usable but we have plenty of weapons here that are going to be exported so we got cannons like saws like that like things are getting real things are getting real if we assemble too early we will draw unwanted attention on the day of the final battle the Shogun's possession will march from the capital to the port once they depart for onegai shima the capital will commence celebrations of the fire festival no one will pay us any mind the pair of birds who indicate that we will assemble before sunset but some government officials will still remain on the mainland we should proceed with caution so they have no reason to alert onigashima or onegai shima I don't I don't know what to call it so we're at curry the pair are no that's the same page curry and Mikasa village can we really wear these of course look at this carpet Oh Armour awesome I want to show this off the new table as soon as possible this armors for true warriors yo-ho-ho and then Luffy's got a samurai out there yo samurai loopy looks clean I'm not gonna trip he looks clean even if he can't use armor or swords and meat just messing around and carrot and chompers got Oh chompers got samurai armor too he looks so intimidating I didn't know chopper could look intimidating I'll be honest I did not know chopper could look intimidating he looks more intimidating than movie choppers looks just looks so cool bro and then um carrots like Wow proper you guys look so cool and then Robins like oh my how cute you look like insects leave it to ramen Robin to put a dead pan down on everything aren't you gonna wear that stuff too that's what's on geez askings or almost like nah it did just slow me down you might need it though you bout to use lower than mine after all man saw Angie sticking in Joe's face you got uh you got a higher fealty it's almost like an MA and flashes off another cliff just the flex on him bro I love that it's on you flex this is bounty Zorro clenches his swords and just cuts off another glyph oh I've been Sarge it's like whoa you want to go at it then I'll kill you the numbers like what are you two doing and then we got robbed insane I wrote you mentioned that Onarga chimas entrance is always in winter so it'll be cold what does that mean their seasons aren't very consistent here on the mainland either it'd be perfect for us if the climate is cold there since we're covered in fur that's what the makes that are saying that means our biggest worry should be the weather conditions rather than the climate itself there'll be there will definitely be a moon that night a full moon but if it is hidden by the clouds it won't be much use to us that's right if all the minks are able to fight the way caret did it'll be an advantage major advantage for our side so whether we'll be able to use Subang will defend our luck oh sorry so whether we'll be able to use oolong will depend on our luck regardless we need max turn whooshing the guardians to make it back in time what's wrong Luffy that's what choppers asking big mom is here but jimbe still hasn't come she's the reason we are able to escape oh so the finally bringing up djembe all we're seeing a picture of djembe even if it's just a flashback and then the rearguard please leave it to me don't forget you and BAE I'm your captain now we'll wait for you oh no you must come he took care of his loose ends we could join us I'm sure he'll be a welcome addition that's what Laura says there's still time if he's alive we'll come he's definitely alive he'll come it's a Luffy's worried about you and May that's nice to see that's nice to see outside the gates at the flower capital episode out the witching hour boy came last night what wait a minute I may be forgetting one oh but wasn't uh wasn't what's-his-face I Tony Lee also I think he was I can't believe I forgot his name I feel so bad but I can't believe wasn't he the witching hour boy if I remember correctly I'm pretty sure he was the witching hour boy but yeah whatever let's just keep me I'm pretty sure that just means there someone else so the witching hour boy came last night there wasn't any news of a robbery in the capital no was there but look there's money here we may not be able to participate in tomorrow's fire festival but will at least be able to afford some water with this so this is M Basu town right smiling folk then we're in curry oka borrow town the mountain hideout of the bandits was burned to the ground you look like you know something about it so he's just Holmes just trying to bully people when we all know how trash this man is okay so why would they continue to steal food from our farm instead of coming for revenge well start talking I don't know anything what's prosper that's the crowds and then it's like if the rumor about the nine routes gabbard's returning this true maybe they're responsible for the missing food in that case we cannot give them away which we do what are you lot mumbling about I will show you the way do not lay another hands on these people so that's a suru and yep can a man's life oh oh Sulu show me so you know what happened you will see if you follow me although it'll be a long journey they must have gathered a lot of people to require all that food kin Aman you must really be back in one oh right I could not believe it when I met Kiku that's a weird ending Kiku no joke right I could not believe it when I met Kiku know Joel again I still hate the fact that Keith who's a man it just kills me it steps on my soul and I know it steps on a lot of other people's souls because that video got 1800 views but yeah let's just keep going and then OC was like I will not allow them to thwart your plans please return the country to the Kisuke clan Oh - there's no need to cover for us that is right you do not need to worry about us getting enough food to eat are filled with a dream come true none of us would mind dying after that and then she's like huh and Hold'em is like huh huh the night before the final battle oh so there's these Bert's model users no bird so that's a bird small loser that's a butterfly small user and another bird smile user okay so it's true after all it's really here stop lollygagging in and do as I told you so I'm not sure who those bird dudes are the smiles are weird because it's like a whole it's a whole animal on them right I quote him he's got an actual lying stomach that tomorrow user we just saw there's like an eagle head on his head like it's just kind of weird I like the normals Owen just like augmented animal abilities instead of a whole another animal so it's like hmm the smile was they I have a lot of potential but Oda has not been expounding on problem that yet so now we're at Currie beach well as you wish so we're at the sunny now wait as you wish should be a peak piece of cake so the small users are looking at the sunny no no no did the Sun you just get destroyed if it got destroyed I'm gonna be so triggered so there's a whole explosion it's been destroyed excellent Moo ha ha ha I think that's wrote you sayin that next up the great bridge linking TB and Jude on is this real okay isn't it this bridge important silence move on to the next one I think they destroyed the sunny I think they just destroyed the pirate Kings ship did they just destroyed the pirate king ship um I'm kind of him did they just destroy the future pirate king ship okay then okay let's just persevere through this because yeah this is one piece greatness and Oda will probably make it right in the coming chapters okay look at the bridge connecting the two regions all right so the great bridge linking ringo and hack my is also destroyed cliff the great bridge connecting the two regions why did this happen now we cannot cross and that's just the random just wanna people in a rope she's like next up the curry port Itachi these ships will never sail again good just as planned so he blew up all the ships but what happened did they get to see the same where I myself but could they really have left 20 years through time from within a burning castle or less the true that their heads were never found so I can never be certain of their death well even if I had seen them it would still be hard to believe the bridge linking Korean Sudan is now destroyed to make matters worse that fool gasps three good oh yeah it's like discord and that's another I saw discord I was confused I just thought if the chatting app but okay just to make matters worse that fool Yasui cost some discord for my retainers they were already doubting me after all it was all a prank Wow but just remember that throwback to Tony Yasu he made me a laughingstock but it turned out that these reports were accurate it does not matter whether others take my words seriously so long as I am the one with power so he's just the power obsessed guy and he's like Moo ha ha ha ha if I block every route leading to the port to collie a I wonder what they'll do 4000 people it's quite impressive that they were may able to gather so many however not a single person will show up so right the straw hats weren't there because the bridges were blown up it's kind of weird though cuz wouldn't come on no the bridges were burst up because it's just all the bridges exploded I feel like that would be kind of news the ghost of the red scab reach out true despair once they realize they have been abandoned they will not be given the opportunity to take the revenge now back in the present you dumb port to cog a stop it all of you if we go now we'll just be suicide because now the nine scammers are trying to go by themselves we can try at a later date the next chance we get we get out a fourth wait another year this is Kinnaman we will never get another chance to do this discreetly our caption of Oh dawn will be exposed and then kinda will spend his entire army or since his entire army to hunt down each and every rebel we will not be able to steal any more food either I am sure you heard the reports for avenue curry presidents of oka borrow put their trust in us to win the final battle they cover for us and their town was burned to the ground my wife was there so yeah hold him burn the town down and it's like please let us go lord momo knows k we do you really command us to run again and lift the rest of her lives in shame at the moment no scales like what would become of me then and then Rises like survive living together with lady Hiyori you can and then he's like do not decide for me and then ki no moans like your father must alone at first too if we I never met Lord Odin none of us would have become samurai we were just a ragtag group of amateurs that is why must carry out our duty as Lord Odin Samurai until the bitter end and then listen up everyone there's a reason why this country has been isolated for hundreds of years so this is a flashback to Odin talking and that reason is equally connected to the Kisuke fan and time its purpose will be fulfilled in order for the tribes of this world to turn we must open Manos Bert Pat borders I just messed it up at last and it's like in the past thirty nine years ago the flour capital and then wait did I just give up H no I didn't then they're like hey hide your daughters hide your wives close up shop during this era there was an infamous and charismatic commanding flower Capitol Heights livestock hurry here he comes so if they're hiding like their wives daughters livestock Kisuke Oh Eden has returned he failed to set sail again hurry up and die already ah how suffocating this country is to preempt so they're clowning Odin for trying to set sail hell I guess an Odin just from a silhouette he looks like he's gonna be another goofy Oda character character that's what it just kind of looks like just another goofy character but like super strong so I'm excited to see old and I'm tired of seeing the man silhouettes and that was the end of the chapter so this chapter I give a solid six or maybe seven because setup chapters are needed it kind of sucked to be over but I guess maybe like ten more setup chapters kind of but the setup chapters are about to leave and it's just like yeah I'm tired of seeing Odin silhouette I just want to see his actual face you know what I'm saying you feel me and I can't wait for wanna to finally get rolling that's just gonna be great that's gonna be lip that's gonna be awesome I'm probably going to stop this room now because I don't really have any other chapter predictions you know what I'm saying it's just like the chapter was good it was good not bad not outstanding it which is good and there's nothing really to discuss about it just a bunch of information it's not like chapter nine hundred fifty seven or fifty six where a lot of theories can stem from this just information and even though those other chapters for information I was like information with mystery this is just hard factual information right here so there's not really a lot I can do so yeah thanks for watching if you draw my content and only finger on my content like this video subscribe to notifications for more one piece content and yeah I'll see you guys in the next video and I will see you in the next weekly stream hopefully next chapter will be fire peace", "_otT1DVvdxQ": "uh-uh anime fans one-piece fans what's good the answer that question of course is one piece one pieces was good let me just adjust the mic real quick and yeah as you can see another one-piece live reaction I am actually sick right now so that's why my voice kinda sounds weird today we got the straw hat if you know what I'm saying we got the straw hat so yeah let's start this one piece chapter 961 huh let's go so it's called the mountain god incident so it's kind of a continuation from the flashback last week so that's gonna be pretty cool huh let me just adjust em put some more because I feel like it's not bad it's in a bad position alright so the cover page is beige on my family and we got where these people attacked so that's a bunch it's just a bunch of attack people we see a gotti and Viggo I think his name was I don't know I kind of got a thing I think it's Viggo but we see them there so now we get into the actual flashback of the story so it's just everybody screaming because if you remember the giant goat was coming so that's what we'll do about the giant mountain God so we got all these people yelling and running and then kinema is like are the people around him men are like could the capital really get destroyed over this little thing and the pig was like oink oink and then Kenny mourns like Oh be quiet so I guess it actually was c'mon not the UM people around him hmm so right we're gonna see that so that is why I told you to give it to me no please wait this bar is worth a white piece of gold I finally pay off my debts then I would and bendre was just laughing at him and then Odin said tuck in Amman give me the boar and then Sandra was like he's Kisuke Odin the one and only the only adult I do not despise for being a fool the white man I actually respect so if we're just on the subject of dead row a little bit just on the subject of dead row he really seems like kosher oh you know what I'm saying like this is the one thing I love about what nothing wrong I think one of the many things I love about one piece just the tons of Easter eggs and throw back so Sandra looks a lot like the kid virgin of kocho the man who kind of trades ro and the sword techniques the one who's dojos always under and the father of Kawena so that is some some stuff to look at right there right so Dan was just looking at oten and I'm raishin and the people are like the mountain guard would only come down the mountain if this child was kidnapped somebody brought a child here why Poor's been the ancient errands of sorry white boards mean that heralds of gods is a chat knowledge many assume there was only a superstition we must appease the mountain gods very quickly keep an eye out for a small whiteboard if we failed to return at the mountain God to the mountain God the capital will be destroyed sorry my meetings kind of off because as I said sickness so right let's just get back into it so like oh so now we see it this this is the one big picnic she's like oink oink and just bite some building in half so the pig is like as big bigger than a whole city block this is giant and people are like it's eating humans and houses whole wah so the pig is just kind of roaring through places and then one guy's like please help me save me yeah our Father so one please help the borate my daughter this is a nightmare so this boar is just up this is one angry mother to say the least so you know how they say don't be don't get between a bear and a child don't get between a mountain guard in its child just uh just a word of advice let me respond to the chat real quick all right so let's get back into this there you are I finally found you hey you are the boar Napper you stole it from us anyway you must take it back to the mountains immediately mountain guard is headed straight for us follows the little guys scent we had no idea this would happen my comrades where you can find the mountain God because they had the little boy sent on them what your friend Oh Cyril got caught up in the mess - what we wanted to get the white boar back from you so we took her hostage but while we were making our way down the mountain they were already in and then kinam on it's like this is all your fault that monster will come straight here because of the scent here it comes so Ken Amon is mad and can I March is facing down this boar man huh he is facing down this boy just like that's when you gotta pull it respect on Kinnaman okay like as much as respect that you gonna put on this hat right Foxfire c'mon he can cut fire and now like when he realized the food was eaten by the mountain goat or bora we know she's not eaten cuz we've seen her 20 years later or more than that but she he's just facing I don't even think he could cook fire at this point so you know like he's got guts and he's facing down this force and you gotta put respect on kid him um for that let me respond to the choice just again okay so alright let let's get back into this what am i doing okay I'm talking too much sniffing if the boys just glaring down at him and then he's just for calling Oh sue he stole again how awful and he's like I'll pay you back get a real job kid Aman if you stay in the Yakuza you will probably end up dead fine by me no one would care if I died anyway how sad and then he's like give me back old suru and he's just remembering all these things about her and then he jumps on divorce now and slashes his nose okay I see you even though that did nothing so he slashes this boars nose and then the board just headbutts a house and just matches him into the house so that's that's some savagery that's some savagery then we see the boars blood on the ground or wait nope is that the poorest player to kill bronze book oh he jumped up the boars nose and stabbed the boar or slashed the boar in the forehead and then a bunch of guys are like boy stop it if there's a mountain guard wha no could be destroyed and then the kanima is like I will slice open your stomach beast I will get o Tsuru back what kind of God are you and then the big just borings again and smashes his head and to the more buildings to try and Rekha wrecking him on up in here ref you kill him on except you're not dead obviously then Odin said exactly what I've been thinking that boy has guts yes he does and then dad was like stop it kid Aman then we see blood this time it is come on blood and he falls down I still can't get my head around the fact that Ken Amon was blonde when he was younger oh wow Wow let me respond to the chat one more time but anyway okay I am talking way too much bro there's some funny things up in the chat but then Ken Aman's lying on the ground he's kind of bloodied and wait right he's seen the mountain gone upside down because he is like on the ground and he's like if Oh soon dies because of me then I have no right to continue living and then get him on like hey boy is this what you've been looking for wait oh no Odin all right so this is probably the the beginning of Odin's like submission of Currie kind of well this is the flower capital but this is probably what cotton respect how we met Ken Amon got kin Aman under his wing and Odin's like facing on the war now holding the pig and then the guy I'm still not completely sure who he is I guess he's just some random Harold Romano he's like Odin Kazuki that cursed child he's behind yet another disaster so now they're blaming up on Odin when it was kind of mom's fault wait I guess when he do things and it be be uh-hmm they're just kind of blaming everything on Odin because he's got such a reputation and also just responding to something that was said in the chat I can't really put the pictures of the actual chapter on the screen because that will get me very much copy strike that I have done it before and I had to delete those videos so maybe I could find a way around it but for now I'm not gonna be able to do that and then the Herald's like he caused this and then Odin's like I was craving some more and then all the people are like give me back my money how my mother not money how could you do something so cruel get me back my daughter and then can I was like no I am responsible for this but Odin is taking all the blame and then Odin's like Odin to swordstyle so he used the to store style not the one torn style the three sword style not the UH not the four sword styles that's the thing or the nine sword style or anything like that the two sword style and he's like Odin - sword style token shirataki okay okay so we are actually starting to get a glimpse of the power that Odin Kazuki possesses he just used his apparently what's the tacho it when did he call it his in shirataki so he just used an attack of his toga Derek's heart of the I'm tripping over my words toga in shirataki to slice the boar in half like at the mouth so like where the mouth starts he sliced it just like completely through and this board like as big as multiple city blocks then all the people are just like in shock they're like what like the boar right now it just looks like a super Wow so that is a very uh powerful attack to say the least he cut the boar like boom right at the mouth and down its whole body so Odin is definitely a powerful individual a nobody was just feeding that but we're just starting to see even when he was young Odin's doing pretty things and then then droves just looking at him like oh so cool kena Mars in chalk and then he Ogura was among the crowd so he overall is probably planing to start the boar cuz he'll grow seems like a person who definitely would have the power to stop the boars but she's like we should head back cuz he don't have to do anything because Odin stopped it and now then this is like the narrator now and I said that an entire village worth people was eaten by the boar by the board the council may have survived but nearly a quarter of the city was lost miraculously there were no human fatalities and then oh so apparently he cut the bar open and then all the people came out so then we just see a bunch of people awake all right so soon who came out the stomach of the board she's like Kim Chan and now she's all crying and stuff and then they're like what wouldn't it was so cool we should probably thank him but it was his phone in the first place he's a criminal and then one guy's like he's so cool I almost cried out and odd they're all thinking and then Ken Omar was like listen to everyone I have a confession to make and then and then kid Amon is like I guess he feels bad that Odin I guess kin Amon is feeling bad that Odin took all the blame for his mess up so he's like listen everyone I have a confession to make and then Odin smashes him on the head that would be pointless okay so like we were already hinted that this is the type of person that Odin is but now it's like we're starting to see like even though Odin does a lot of crazy stuff a lot of morally questionable questionable stuff he's still like a good guy like he literally knocks get him on out for like tried to confess that he was the one who brought the mountain guard down on the flower Capitol I know it's like that would be pointless and then this guy he's like uh he seems to be the UH he seems to the sky he seems to be the person who's like the what's the word the secretary of Wooden's father whose name I can't remember right now and there's a lot of theories circulating that he might actually be Orochi and I guess he does kind of look like a real G and then he said I apologize for the timing but and Odin's like wah ha ha I see so I have been disowned not only that but I've been exiled from the capital so Odin's dad just exiled him at this point so I guess this was kind of the start of uh it is kind of a star of his assumption sub subjugation of the curry of the curry region because he got exiled after this and then they're like how pathetic Lord Shogun it looks like you like the entire flower capitals mitad that it cannot handle me anymore so and is like laughing at them and then he said this is exactly what I wanted time to head over to the other side of the river I'll be sleeping there by the sunset I mean something to eat so by agents doesn't then Odin cost the mountain God incident but it was actually kind of mom but the history records will say Odin did it so it's a bit crazy because o it is like they had they admitted they can't handle me anymore by exiling me so so yeah it's crazy in a chat if you wonder why I keep grinning and a chat that is not the see to chat somebody keeps making means out of this reaction screenshotting me and making memes which is why I keep cracking up from down sit on my bad and then assumes like why you cry are you crying Kim Chan and then he's like of course not oh suru that man I would happily die for someone like him so he's like of course not of course I'm not crying and here's our literally just streaming down his face it's like I would have to leave that for someone like him and I know she was like are you sure you're not crying and then uh then dentro was like I feel the same way and then all right and then drill runs after Odin and then he'd kill him I was like hey wait up dander oh and McDonald's like you inspire me first and then I was like the most no way is different I will be his first follower so Dan euro and kid Amon are arguing over uh dendro and Kinnaman are arguing over who will be Odin's first follower so like that just you always see how inspiring Odin is when people are arguing I want to be known as his first followers it's an interest there's like he inspired me first and then two months like the emotional weight was different so I had to be these words following so like you just know Odin is like goofy level inspiration right here and then the people who are just watching them who al who like live in the flower capital are like I envy their free spirits that want to go with them too and then it's the narrator's like at this moment these men suppress their desired followed him and on this day in on wait and on this day the balance of the capital was tilted at more ways than one so that it says Ronal the haka by region so we're in how come I now welcome welcome Lord Odin is as a pleasure it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance Thorin Jia Hui has been looking forward to your arrival stop lying no way he would be happy to see me you are correct I would not oh yeah suey all right shemar ski Yasui rest in peace man but this is the flashback so you're not dead yet and he's like you're correct I would not get excited over sorry he's like you are correct I would not get excited over an exiled fool from the capital what do you want Onan and you even brought some henchmen with you and then and then oh and it's like uh ah please hold on there's a puddle or no not Odin sorry I get confused Yasui is like subordinates are like oh please put on there's a puddle all right please step over me to cross the puddle and then oh just like hey uncle what's with this creepy weirdo and then the asking was like do not be so rude he is my newest servant and then oh I see you mr. Ichiro Oda I definitely see okay so some people were telling me this chapter was mid but that is definitely not okay so the guy the Secretary of own ins father was not Orochi the new service that Yasui was talking about the one who jumped on a puddle so Odin could step over him to get to Lord Yasui is actually Orochi so somebody who would throw his own body over a puddle - uh somebody who had like literally jump on a puddle Toula old and passed over without stepping in the puddle later betrayed Odin vilified him and tried to tell all of his subordinates and he's this little nice child version of a roach she says hey I was taken in by Lord yeah sweet my name is Orochi but I am a humble servant or he said I am but a humble servant and he just is a little brass foot like snot running down his face he's all hurt from jumping on the ground like that let Odin walk over the puddle without like wetting his shoes and he's all humble this this chat was not dead this is actually a big reveal so Orochi with a servant of lord Yasui who he just killed he literally just killed his former okay that was a plot twist I did not expect coming I just assumed that I wrote he would be like a member of one of the royal households but no but bruh Oh another going on twist I see I did not expect that coming let's get a round of applause for Eiichiro Oda please another going to plot twist so I was talking to one of my boys on discord and he said he feels like every chapter of wanto from chapter 3 is slowly and slightly getting better each chapter and I'm starting to agree with that I mean it's like since act 3 so bro so Orochi was the servant of thorn yes we and whatsmore lord Yasui took him in when he was but like some poor homeless kid on the street apparently we don't know where I guess we took him in from but yes we took him in and he was his new servant and he jumped on the ground for odin to cross safely but he is now the evil Shogun of our know who's a coward who ate an Opie devil fruit who teamed up with Kaito who tried to erase oh it is like good history vilify him make everyone hate him and kill all his subordinates and is literally leaving guano in the pit of Hades right now and it's been horrible to all citizens and making more kids like how he was probably before he joined yeah sweet what a jerk so yeah you can expect more videos probably around like this blockless but good plot twist mr. Oda let me just say you can see my clapping so this chapter was a 9 out of 10 just for that plot twist I know a lot of you are gonna be like it was just one plot twist but I feel like this was a super big one like this was a good plot twist like this is a plot twist that kind of changes our view of who Orochi is it really does yeah I respect this plot twist uh-huh so yep nine outta 10 chapter I'm a wrap this up thanks for watching if you drama content and only teen drama content like this video subscribe in another kitchen for more one piece called that oh that's probably the fastest I've ever said that and yep taking off the loopy hat which is how you know I'm about a dip and yeah I will see you in the next video", "TICTjaJRX4M": "I also come across the two pineapples widows are like beautiful brilliant that's out to fish off the top boxes sitting alongside me it's regular ecologist sorry fellows used to be a basketball ER I had a basketball oh yeah no he's a resident mixologist visited me so it's good to see you again soon hear me oh okay I love the amplified off of a hole did that come on fellas the man came up with the guys was like when they came to Barbados from from Spain he was shopping around and he just come across this painting with this salad with just a pineapple on a painting and they bought - I'm very back in the office and it was like what to name is what - Mimi please become known to look at you see he was looking at some scene in and they just go back we're back up in the offices now and they say no the painting pineapple just let me do the bluefin opportunity and that's all basically you get to become I'm coming every person what would you recommend well we have [Music] that means I was up against [Music] [Music] you", "ir5AQm2yUOg": "yo you got everyone the blue pineapple Phoenix here today we have another livestream with these good youtubers z-boy mm of clay member Sabol be sure to subscribe to their channels link will be in the description Nonnie so anyways today we are going to livestream on weather but that's already for the new world I myself believe they already but z-boy and Sabo do not think they are ready for the new world so we'll just start this pretty simple Sabo why do you think the straw hats are not ready for the new world well for several reasons mostly because of the way they've like you know won their fights especially like Luffy really you know a lot of his fights he's won but but uh well his fighters like he's always not like you know healthy compared to like you know pre time-skip were like a lot of the battles he fought was like really just like one-on-one battles like you know starting from Michael you know you know he had help yeah it's fine but like um he's shoveling snow oh okay yeah so like um was I saying so like you know what commingle like the myfunc that one was like when he ran out of gear forth and it's like he had all these people to call him helping him and stuff like that you know before he was able to win against a flamingo and then when he was fighting cracker like I don't know laughs I was even if I was a joke and then the whole Luffy versus got a curry thing like he answers shouldn't have won that fight the way it was like portrayed you know yeah and then out of straw hats roofie the only one who's really been pushing himself so I mean maybe luffy's ray first the new world but I compared to everyone else's like oh no cuz I sorrows just been Coulson and Sanji hasn't really done much honestly and then the rest of the straw hats like they've never they haven't really fought anyone of note you know so it's like they're not really getting stronger so true they still have yet to show off their actual strength b-boy you'll conquer with him or do you have anything else to add basically one shot about Kaito I was like no he wasn't ready you know I'm saying it just look good like for one alright Nami is needed like at least one or two freakin power-ups you know post time skip after her training Chomper got beat by a bunch of trees thank you I forgot to add that thank you actually likes energy man but you know I'm saying but Sonia still is like not showing the best negative by some nails you know you know they they need a little extra training any less a little extra roof little Hester poof they like it like they're strong but they still need really to ten with the top tiers yeah so I do you think they're ready for the new world the fact I'll use that was own logic against him in this case Sabo said that none of the other straw hats touch on goofy and sangee in a bit but Sabo said that none of the straw hats have fought anyone of notes which I can the way I view that is because they haven't bought any one of know they're still unknown factors they seem very strong of course Nami she really did only get strong after Zeus she was still strong but this really magnified in a car by then Sanji Sonya is a hard one because it's hard to tell if Sarge II was if Sanji was just weak or if he wasn't trying or if he was just fighting strong guys but when he was fighting guys like daifuku n' oven i think it is noteworthy they're not nowhere but I think it's worthy to note that Sanji when he when he clashed with them briefly he was he did have the upper hand when he was fighting oven it when it was fight and died fuku when he got those clashes he was Virgo no I can't tell virgos strong or fees cuz Virgo didn't seem to be that strong except that he was beating Santi I personally feel like Sonia would it beat him if that kept going on but that could imply or not and now I was Luffy so of course Luffy did have help ride doflamingo the thing with Luffy see does it have stamina pre time skipper so I I see what you mean by leafy same Luffy isn't ready for the new world but I would disagree - somewhat because doflamingo the only reason you would've beat Luffy if you didn't have help from the car - Coliseum people it's because Luffy ran out of gear for when he was in there for he was destroying him and now I know people are like why use the gamma knife stabbed OFI but I really don't find his that same thing with Nami helping defeat I feel they just made it easier for him he still would have won like what though see when dopey got gammon I won he was healing himself I know that was first aid it wasn't complete but if no fee was getting knocked around like that even if he was at full strength he still would have gotten knocked around like that the category fight of course Luffy a bully people will say Luffy using brulee was cheap and category I think of them as equals even if the fight was a bit strange our movies apart and he got lucky category said they were equals so I say he's equal I think ready for the New World and I really cuts on this or anything because all I said done anything let me know okay was alright okay Zhora was ready for the new world he should be like one shot in hawkins okay here's a day their raid that barely sub by the new world like soggy is pretty much the dirt Strong's in the curry I don't care no one said with the trolling or the hate or the logy memes or whatever what we know he's the Daris strongest in a crew discounting djembe and in even steel you know he didn't he did in one shot oven that food and they're not even like the strongest a big moms crew so it begs the question what would happen the straw has where at marine forward like okay so maybe maybe maybe I'll know I I wouldn't be a big fan of all the dusters because I always feel like what may destroy her so great was that they had individual strengths right and then it was like there was like people's like oh man there's such a small crew but they're so strong so I wouldn't like if it was like kind of like where's the straw hats is like well we don't have to get too too strong because we have to pirate fleet to back us up like I would like it like it in this series the straw has just just the straw hats are just so strong the wears like they could basically do a white beer do that marine for you know like beRecruited at marine forward so it if if if it's just a straw hats themselves that we just tell me the straw has themselves and I didn't know at that level um with Luffy he did can defeat category but he also didn't a lot of things played instead and yeah man basically just debt I mean Frankie uh Frankie what a joke post on Scott I'm sorry bro yeah okay many ways go ahead somebody else yes Apple what do you have to say Szabo do you have to say a few hours later oh you know I'm saying oh I'm Szabo you know I'm saying Luke he can't fight sobbing yeah so yeah he's not ready for New World I think Sabol went somewhere when you switch he'll gets back I will say my piece on this straw hat the straw hats as a crew they're stronger than the Don Quixote pirates I don't think that's debatable the Don Quixote pirates are supposedly a new world cruel the straw hats aren't a Janka level crew as the moment but I would say they are in you what they're strong enough to be won't new world crew because the Don Quixote pirates Piku was their third strongest member with their second strongest member and of course Zorro destroyed him and if peak is acceptable as a strong member of the New World I would say that the straw hats also are strong members of the New World that they're strong enough to be part of the New World what do you think about that hmm I mean Zorro he needed help being pika I'm just saying I'm just saying listen he didn't want shot pika mm-hmm but anyways you know like do you think they're gonna train wanna I don't know how that's gonna happen but you know zero dead still he'd be pika nonetheless he still be pika I mean but compare pika - al ki ji Hui dings winning Oh yo Kiki I personally think okay dzongkha level because I believe Sakas MP is anca level now kg BOTS a Kazuki for 10 days so I believe he is nyaka level are close to it so um pika pika he couldn't he's really not that strong but in the eyes the new world he apparently is no no he's not that strong he just says del flu allowed him to just maneuver around and run away for a couple of hours okay yeah yeah and then he can destroy towns but that'll become bigger than a town yes yeah I pick himself I think his weakened in Virgo but uh yeah I would say that I would say I think Burke Virgo could be pika because Virgo is just that strong but cuz we're go he's weaker than doflamingo obviously but he's pretty strong and then the spa and then going into zorro zorro I don't really know how strong it is some people saying stronger than doflamingo I don't really think that doesn't work so a family I know I do not think that I Cesaro is not stronger than till Mingo there was this one person and then of course there's some people I'm pretty sure you've seen them on the BDA discord but some people know genuinely believe they're always stronger than big mom because Charles input a [ __ ] but of course I don't think that but my point is that if the Don Quixote pirates or the Kuja pirates or just okay you're back great but if any of the Pirates the Pirates on the new world like the donkey of the pirates are the Kuja pirates or if any of those parts are acceptable as a new world crew I was in the straw hats already there's no doubt that straw hats are stronger than the DeHart got Don Quixote pirates in my mind that they're insulting but the reason why they've been where they are for like 20-some years they're not strong enough you know right now I got I mean I mean okay that's what I said they're ready to barely survive like in Berlin they're struggling right they are struggling they're struggling to survive in the new world and like I said before if you're all to belief to the straw hat should just be the straw hats do they happen again it wears like they you're supposed to do today it's pretty much like the crew themselves or this will be so should only they don't need a lot of members so right everything about eight people need to be strong enough to like pretty much take over the new world then yeah Jeff Lee they definitely need some some some Tom Chambers some some 20 times gravity some some some fairy tale friendship power of type training oh please no please fairy tales good anime but I would get into that but yeah one I want to backtrack and have a done towards avoid saying so remember when you're talking about you know how nami got Zeus and stuff yes like that's one of my problems like Nami given Zeus and kind of like Sanjay again the rage it's like they haven't even really proved themselves enough to like you know get like extra stuff for power-ups which is my problem it's like oh yeah like Nami God who's us apart was like she hasn't even done anything to show she needed something extra yet same thing with Sanjay he hasn't even really gone all out yet to even really get a power up so it's like were they actually really ready before they came to the new world like you know right maybe they won't leave that's just what it feels like I'm like you know how like I'm black we're supposed to be luffy's rival right yeah go on well because of like how like all those are in the stories like you know I mean I'm like Luffy has some animosity still Torres Blackbeard like because you know Luffy and black bread they are kind of similar you know but obviously like holster extremes to do stuff and I just feel like you know at the end of the I didn't if one piece is gonna be Luffy versus Blackbeard and random black bears Cruz is looking like a little too good for luffy's crew like the only people I can see really like going against his Quran I was like Luffy Zorro Sanji and like Jim Bay of all the other all the other ones I'm just like like what are they gonna do like that's what Wanda was for I was saying I was Eduardo it's where they get stronger where the Bianca level crew and then they can go through the fight said you then they can go against Blackbeard who I know I'm just gonna delve into this first a short digression I think Blackbeard is cosmic the villain but villain like using a Naruto reference he's kinda like Madara but leafy's rival is someone else who I think is kids stories were in this like I get that him and killer rivals but the way is were in is I've like at when it comes down to like who's gonna be our raft so like fighting for the one piece after like is like Luffy and Blackbeard yeah that's what I think Luffy and kid will fight and then get one hey V boy what do you think of this short digression before we get back to the main topic I'm gonna play devil's advocate and I'm going to try to play both sides really the major speech to make this super interesting for the for the side of that they are ready for the new world I mean I mean even before even post even pre time skip they did struggle um I feel like it should be 2 V 2 man where are these people at that we told them it was a penny but I'm this plan even pre times get they did did struggle even backed in and then in his Lobby happen to where is like oh man they really are super duper strong so it could be the case where we just haven't seen everything a they could have they they can do because we already when this floor has worked together they're monsters right like when they sit down and stop getting separated every arc um there there there there they're terminators Darren stop who they defeated pretty almost they they did they just good stuff against or like ORS was like yeah my favorite item one piece yeah backtracking a bit farther back to whether the world is ready for the new world we're saying that he should have been able to one-shot Hawkins I don't think so because Hawkins like we see with Luffy was training and stuff like Hawkins he was actively fighting in the new world for two years he's gonna be pretty strong so I would say zero it's not like it's oral Zorro loading the boat killed Hawkins like two times I think Hawking his lives his lives but how do you guys know nothing much okay so we're talking about whether the straw hats are ready okay we're gonna have to wrap up soon but what are your opinions on it King Oh about well about what whether if this world are there I are they ready for the new world yeah I mean I think they are I mean considering what happened in dress Rosa and stuff like that I think at least solo is Sanjay I would say he's there okay the rest of the crew because think about it you only need me down on the excuse because I'm so sorry you only need to hard to use is really I mean three and we got for hockey uses on a crew counting Issa and the rest of them really know he need hugga there Opie in their own weight by Nami she got home Zeus by come on yes to more than ready Zack is with a store had some work already so yeah I do not complete the last power up power up level so the whole course I don't think I did we would convince the are you can Umbra me both don't you you animate side I don't know if you guys can hear me or not but we're gonna have to end the livestream here for joining Thank You King thank you see boys Thank You Sabo thank you everyone for watching subscribe to change channels subscribe to flavor subscribe to z-boys channel link will be in the description also subscribe to my new MV channel the link will also be in the description thanks for watching", "-R0jKXG5zVE": "or you might can you chop us a spear CP please hey guys what's going on its 50 made here back with another video for you guys I've been away for some time right now but I'm currently back up in year 12 and I'm gonna make some more videos for you guys so straight off the bat today cigarette review you guys will be the wind filled optimum crush blues this is British American Tobacco and I've got this Tran limited version so it's a menthol cigarette as well because of the optimum crush so it's a pop filter so straight off the bat I want to get you guys a look at the cigarette we can see here this is the standard Taylor cigarette with the cork style filter obviously the standard white cotton filter if we take a look at the serial number right here once it focuses you can faintly say it VP 1 1 4 so VP 11 4 that's the serial number here for Australia and as I said it has a normal standard cork style filter with white cotton inside so straight off straight off from here we're going to give it a smell get a smell of that tobacco so let's get right into it if you've been following my I YouTube channel you'll see that I've actually done a winfield blue rolling tobacco as well and this is actually pretty much the same thing right here that's that quite mellow taste it's quite deep down and savory so it's bringing me that savory taste which is something that I love I love my winfield so I've got a love a winning but anyway let's load up this cigarette just a small bit one don't hate me because you ain't me I've got a white one so let's get right to this straight off the get-go right here I do love the initial taste of this cigarette it has a great taste great inhale and everything let's go for a straight inhale test and see how it goes and just away guys just a tip I haven't actually popped the filter the filter yet so the menthol inside the filter so I'll do that in a second so the taste of this the cigarette is just beautiful I had a little inhale then it goes down very well very smooth so right about now I'm going to crack the menthol open so I just press down on the filter and the menthol is gonna pop you might hear so you could have heard that that was actually the menthol popping so give it a little bit it's in a share and let's get right to this mental filter Jesus so you can really taste the menthol right here it's not actually too bad it's not too strong not to wake it's one of the better menthols I've ever had once again you can still taste the UH the nice tobacco in there it's very odd mellow and savory as I've said in the wind it'll blue rolling tobacco it's just very good Australian sham limited as well so it's a different brand or different breed if not to make sure Australia it's just I just can't get over and I Betty I just love these cigarettes Winfield blue optimum crush they're pretty standard in Australia for a menthol people love them I've seen quite a few people on the streets using them especially when you go out out and about when you're having a beer or two having a ciggy with your drink it's actually quite nice to have I'll just go for a real deep down inhale others up I'm about midway through the body right here so off of that it's literally nearly on par with the rolling tobacco it's not as good as the rolling tobacco but it's nearly on par with it so I can't actually give you a full review on that compared to the rolling tobacco because obviously I prefer my rollies over my tailored cigarettes but honestly it's just a pinion base people like their tail is people like their rolls it depends what you wanted to do with your cigarette smoking life but I'll tell you what these tailors go very well compared to rolling and other tailors I've had I will admit they are better than a Rothman read I also have a view that if you want to check that up right there they'll be limp once again the menthol just kicks in right there you can you can even taste the menthol aftertaste it goes right through the throat it's not too bad if you like a menthol I would highly recommend trying a cigarette it is actually very good smoke once again we're about over halfway through we're gonna hit we're gonna hit the butts quickly enough but uh overall I'm actually giving this an 8 out of 10 at the moment it's just very nice to smoke very clean the inhale isn't too bad it's got a little bit of harshness but you don't always you always want a little bit of harshness otherwise it just feels like you're smoking oxygen you don't want to smoke the oxygen because after all you just want to be hard can't don't ya know how I'm just feeding boys honestly overall the cigarette is actually very nice I just can't get over it goalless the M bar look at that the Empire it's a perfect member it's a nice cone shape everybody loves a cone or two but once again it's just very nice very hard very slowly that's an even burn even burn so you can see that it is an even burn you can see all around the Empire is very nice as well with a little bit of ash covering the M bar that's the good for a tailor guys honestly I'm buying these for $19 of dick a deck of 25 for a pack it's just a great cigarette for the price you can even do you don't even have to pop the menthol within it so you just make and when he blues so all the way you can either to smoke a witty blue by itself or you can smoke them it though it's your choice it doesn't really matter do as you please at the end of the day you're smoking for your own pleasure that's exactly what I do guys it's just a great cigarette honestly I just love it it's good it's good to smoke it's good to breathe in people love the smell of cigarettes I know several people who don't actually like the UH the idea of smoking but they love the smell of it so I don't know guys I'd seriously try this one out we're coming towards the end of this cigarette right here this Taylor the Winfield doctor been crushed blues I'm going to give these a good eight out of ten eight out of ten on my scale is pretty high these are just great great cigarettes once again from British American Tobacco although they are Australian limited it does not matter these these cigarettes are made in Singapore they are fresh tobacco fresh everything it is just beautiful to smoke so I want to get guys Winfield optimum crushed blues great cigarette to smoke from British American Tobacco just judging off the initial inhale of it great inhale a little bit of harshness to it but it's nothing too serious it is pretty good the body of it once again with the methyl or without the menthol I've had both it is a solid pick I will tell you so judging up this review I'll pay $19 for a pack I'm loving it seriously I would highly recommend going at the bar those they are worth your time they are worth your money if you can get it for cheaper good on your voice that's what we love but at the end of the day it is a great cigarette and I'd highly recommend trying it I'm giving this an 8 out of 10 and I'm telling you guys this isn't great cigarette to smoke and obviously I'm gonna leave you guys to it right now this has been a quick review from your boy kids you mate let's get outta here case", "HPeCUvEf2XA": "I have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually I've been smoking on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up its up everybody youtubes and really busting my balls about their Community Guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off thanks oh yeah what is going on everybody and welcome back to another episode of free [ __ ] / I've been asked this question like a million times over the past couple days because of my most recent video so knock him out both in one episode you know what I mean before we get to that this video is sponsored by my goddamn self so a lot of you guys have been asking for merch specifically merch that doesn't say hey I'm a [ __ ] pothead on it because I understand that right you guys are like yo man I'd like to merch I want to support you but I don't want a pot leaf on my back and I respect that so just for you people I've dropped a piece drip tea it's pretty much the peace tea that we did before it says peace right here on the breast and then a peace sign on the back but it's like dripping it's like liquidy it looks really cool it's probably only gonna be available for two weeks let's make it two weeks so if you guys want to check that out link is in the description make sure to check it out by yourself one two weeks very limited they're [ __ ] awesome doesn't really scream that you smoke weed and yeah pretty cool so ever since I released that video a couple days ago which by the way he's doing very well the most common question that I get asked is Erik if you're not smoking these boo fast carts then what are your favorite cartridges if you know anything about the channel you know that these have been pretty much my go-to for the past couple weeks couple months I don't even know how long but it's usually the Moonrock carts which this one's empty and thus tizzy I found that these two right here are kind of the cleanest high and they give you the best high for sure like one or two hits out of these I'm not gonna lie that I've tried plenty of carts have tried kingpins brass knuckles like legitimate kingpins legitimate brass knuckles and there's a whole bunch of different brands out there for the most part it takes you like what two three hits and then you're like all right now I'm feeling good but with either of these with one solid not even a blinker with one solid hit like five six seconds I'm feeling it and that's that's kind of tough to do with a pen for me right cuz you tolerance just goes higher and higher and higher after every time I'm not sure how much is left in here it's a strawberry Nana car it's pretty much done tastes very good no best thing about cz see like a not a lot of pins make me cough bro I'm not gonna lie after a hit like that but the thing about susie that doesn't make you my daily driver is one it's only available in california and to its proprietary little battery so if this dies i don't have any other device but i have like a million 510 thread battery so that's mainly why this is nice don't get me wrong and they recently remodeled other package its new packaging it's higher THC percentages and there's no pesticides so sissies your thing then go ahead and check it out man but because of those two things it really just i don't really hit it every day you know i mean i don't get the opportunity to smoke bcz every single day however alright the game has changed man dr. zodiac who usually makes the moon rock cartridges said [ __ ] that i want to branch into other things [ __ ] the moon rocks and we got ourselves i'm not sure he's coming out with anymore but we have ourselves six different cartridges six different flavors six different strains from dr. zodiac himself the maker of the moon rocks and they hit the same bro and it takes a lot for me to say that about a cartridge bro there's not many cards out there that hit like a moon rock car but from the [ __ ] himself obviously it's gonna be pretty dope man have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually i've been smokin on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up i actually gave Kyle one of them which is why one of them is missing so it gives me an opportunity to open it up so packaging is on point first of all you have some crazy I there's so much going on right here there's like a lion's a spaceship in the background there's like a little spiral galaxy right there like this is tight I've got to open it up and inside you'll see a battery a charger and your one gram cartridge I think they also sell them in half grams yeah yeah I've never seen him in half grams but there's a little spot right there for a half gram so I imagine that they do now the [ __ ] cartridges a low charger and we have ourselves right here what is this one the Lion Heart clear so a lot of these don't have the strain actually on them I'm not exactly Lionheart distrain I've never heard of it but the other ones I'll go through and tell you what I think this train is but I guess that's part of the fun man little guessing game so very first hit off of this cart by the way as you can see right here we got a little bubble right there and as you guys know I said in my last video I said hey the bubble moves it's bunk so let's go ahead and see if that bubble is moving I'm not even seeing it but I know the bubbles not moving beautiful beautiful man let's go ahead and just give this a nice low trip blinker yeah we'll get a nice rip and then we'll give it a blinker [Music] goddamn bro [Music] [Music] I couldn't even blink it man okay mm-hmm so I'm not gonna lie Lionheart was my least favorite which is why I gave it to Kai but after that hit man I don't know I might have to reconsider lion-hearted clear very fire next one up I think we're going to go through for my favorite to least favorite right now just as we got that one out of the way my very very favorite out of the six new ones that he has is called this Linwood lemonade clear this pen right here straight up tastes like I'm taking a [ __ ] dab bro it's ridiculous like it tastes so much like lemon like I have lemon gene aemon's right now and I think it kind of reminds me of that but every time I rip this it's flavor town and it's high town baby [Music] that's not saying that's insane man I can literally rip these off a pro I mean that would probably be really bad my tolerance but dude god damn I'm eyes and look [ __ ] all right yeah Lin would absolutely fired next up we have a Bobby blues clear which I believe is Blue Dream or something of the sort tastes very much like Blue Dream and it is the second most delicious one oh yeah that's blue dream for sure next up we have the silverback clear which i think is the best look and artwork in my opinion it's my third favorite and this is guerrilla glue like I said these are just assumptions I could be completely flow going wrong about all these but this is this is generally what I'm tasting what I'm getting the effects that I'm getting from these pants man every single pen also has the little logo or the little artwork on it instead of the little doctor zodiac bunny but we do have the bunny right there and we got the bunny right there as well mad goddamn I love these bro I don't know there's just a look about these you know I mean like every single cart looks the [ __ ] same man and at a certain point like when you're getting really high off all the cards still you look for a little something extra right you look for a little pizzazz you look for a little like all the cards are the same I need something that stands out oh wow all right that second hit was a little different hang on that might bump up man I don't know that might bump up to number two right there goddamn that silver bag is why you're next up this could actually this is up there man I'm not gonna lie next up we have the razzle dazzle clear there's a little berry hitting a cartridge right there which is very clean this color is nice I don't know there's something cool about all these like it's one thing to color one things the flavor when things like the plugins and say you should make it I don't know man one's a real bright pink with all the colors on it I think this one really reminds me of an actual moon rock cardiguez which is like a berry flavored moon rock art tastes very similar to that it honestly tastes like a DAB like I don't know man like not a lot of dab cards sometimes dab cards will just be Tudor P if that makes any sense like oh dude this doesn't even taste like weed this just tastes like like a [ __ ] candy cart or something you know what I mean and I don't really [ __ ] with that but these have like it taste like wheat like you know you're getting that wheat I don't know if all of you are under that there's probably gonna be some people that bro I just smoked with a flavor like alright these cards aren't for you then I'm not gonna lie these cards are for getting extremely [ __ ] medicated and a hint of flavor that's like enjoyable but not too much I don't know but it's some good stuff now this last one here is called Frosty's snowcone again don't necessarily know if that's strain or not um but this little it's a little Frosty the Snowman guys looking evil on here what is he I like that a little logo man it's looking [ __ ] cool there's color by the way purple is probably my favorite color like probably a lighter shade of purple is my favorite color but this is solid right here Wow okay wait I feel like I'm cleansing my palette between each of these hits it's kind of a long time and usually on the streams I'm just like so I'm getting a decent amount of time to actually taste these do why is it so [ __ ] hard to rank these bro that's unnecessary like these are all fire five had however much these retail for like fifty sixty seventy bucks I don't know how much I I wouldn't pick one [ __ ] wait hang on if I had people are gonna ask me but they're like dude I only have enough money for one which one should I buy hey I think I'm buying the lemonade yeah that's a no-brainer I think the lemonade ones like no-brainer no-brainer kind of number one there and then number two bro it's like but just pick your poison yeah I mean goddamn everyone's probably gonna ask for this part no we're okay there you go durability tests on the spot [ __ ] beautiful everyone's gonna ask for it Oh first of all we need to get this thumbnail hang on let's get a bang and ask them no going right now oh not today son not [ __ ] today try to do this on stream and it was rather difficult so we're gonna see what's good right here it's just a little difficult because like it's hard to create a seal around so when you're inhaling you're just getting a lot of air all right so if you're not in a state where you can get dr. zodiacs and Moonrock cartridges and you're like damn I still want to have a little so wanna have a little swagger so we'll have a little what are your favorite batteries Eric I can get my own cartridges what do you like to smoke the actual cars use em so great great move question bro I actually have a little something right here it's like a part to a cliche bro personally I like batteries that don't have a button I don't know what it is but like yeah it's an added luxury that you can change the temperature but give a foot most of the time like I just want to hit it take out of my pocket inhale put it in and then we're good you know I mean I have to like click five times turn on and then like one two three and like change the temp and then like all right you know I mean it's just like those added seconds it seems like some [ __ ] but it kind of matters I mentioned this battery and all of these batteries made by Batman on a video before they're on the one gram in one sitting video but their website only sells wholesale they only sell like two dispensaries and stuff you know what it means so you couldn't buy it individually however I've helped you out don't even worry about it we have found an online head shop that was willing to work with us they even gave us a discount code so head up J vape industries it'll be in the description down below and you can use code Eric 10 for 10 percent off I have this battery and all of the magic Bab ballad batteries they're [ __ ] late all right I got you guys don't worry I got you guys take the lemon one of course slide in there and they both have this magnet [ __ ] that's like I don't know why that's so sexy like I don't know why I meant these are both the same color - damn in here I like this little midnight look look that's not coming out man you got a oh you know what I mean like that's [ __ ] tight you don't getting the only gripe on the see cell palm that I like the VAM on better is obviously this one's smaller this one that's a light so you know when you're heating it you know what I mean this one oh there is a light on this one never mind [ __ ] I don't know man look bad the stick one might hit a little harder than this I'd say if you're buying a dr. zodiac pen and you got the battery with it there's no need to upgrade but if you in need of a new battery these are the movement especially if you don't have a proper battery and you have one of those stick low eight dollar ones at the local smoke shop get rid of that [ __ ] it's gonna die in like a month month and a half get either one of these batteries men Eric 10 for 10% off by the merch first but like a if you want to check these out too if you need a battery a go ahead and check them out man I hope you all enjoyed hope you all learn something this wasn't a drugs 101 I don't know why I said that but like I don't learn something about batteries or card in my favorites hey you know what I mean let's get let's get a solid little double hit here going both batteries actually get something cool willing you know yeah when you have three you can actually like hit it properly you know what I mean I'm like yeah look at this cloud that I made my opponent it's just like alright you won't turn it so I have to do it like this I got to hold it that's gonna be the video guys I hope you

ice wax liquidiser Pineapple Express I'm gonna be putting I'm gonna be filling a half a gram cart and I picked out about quarter of wax to put in here that will be enough for this half gram so enough liquidizer to mix i don't know if that made any sense but all this wax is gonna go into this color right here and hopefully it'll be a good amount so the only thing I'm sticky appreciate it's pretty yeah some pretty fire wax this is exclusive in tracks a 3-1 so I have it in there is a shatter and I'm gonna put some I'm gonna put like half of this thing filled up so I'm gonna put just half in there so that's it filled up so I probably just want like uh I think that much I think this would be a good amount yeah so this field uh should be a good amount so I put all that in there and I'm pretty sure that's a good amount all right now I'm just mixing it just getting it in there I could put a little more I need to we're gonna see right now so I'm gonna put this close this and I'm gonna pop it into the microwave real quick and for it I'm up up 11 seconds just because of the microwave I have and yeah and see how see how it looks like after 11 seconds so that was a full 11 seconds and this is how it looks like I don't think it's fully melted in there yes I could just sale then just mix it y'all think it's ready yet I do have another way of making it though but I want to do it the microwave way because I think that seems best for the video so I'm just gonna put in the microwave for just well 5 10 more seconds I'll put 10 more seconds and then put it take it out and find and see how it looks like [Music] as a wax-coated be like melts it honestly looks about better it's pretty well melted I say so I think I should just mix it now mixing it the bottom of it's hot so I'm thinking this off it'll be ready it's got some little things I don't know if that's a wax that hasn't dissolved yet but out it's in there I'm gonna put it for the last two seconds real quick [Music] that will not do anything during a pretty good mix right now looks good couple things in there but I'll know what that is I just hope it's like a half a mile east all right so I think it should be good to fill it in a cart now looks like half a gram trust me it's about half a gram I just hope it's a little thick enough you know all right so here I have the cart pull the top off and just drip it in here so it looks like that was perfectly a [ __ ] half gram holy [ __ ] it's literally filled to like the very [ __ ] top it looks really [ __ ] good - honestly I kind of wish I could put the rest of this in there I don't want you so bad that's how good it looks oh she looks fire yeah it's filled to the [ __ ] it might drip out a little bit oh yeah so just use this little micro dropper and just suck that little sucker up damn dude this looks really gasps I'm not gonna [ __ ] lie oh dude look at that damn dude I don't know whether to sell it keep this one nothing so this was the ending result then here is how it looks like actually looks really good looks queer it's not super clear but it's pretty clear especially with the wax I use this is a really good shatter really pull and chatter - so now you could package these up to Sally or whatever and yeah or you can keep them to smoke alright got this house where this is what it looks like on the battery the dark the very dark part on the bottom is how the other stuff look like that's how dark it was but now with the new [ __ ] it looks way brighter and more good alright well thing guys for watching yeah you guys should get this [ __ ] so get like a quarter of wax and every half gram it's really not that hard I found it that it's pretty potent and i eyeball that little quarter the quarter of a half gram out of the quarter of a gram so i i barley and yeah", "8Z6DG1wer6E": "hey babe and mr. Shawn back to do another EGS review this time I'm doing two flavors from the shark gummies eliquid line and this is made by shark amis either grid by Taylor vapors so um I'm gonna be trippin both of these on my x1 on top of my tugboat if you guys miss the review on x1 I did do a quick review on this along with my build I will link that video down below just in case you missed them you could also find both these products at premium vape supply which I will list right here and also vape the industries right here you can use the kit the code the wm10 for 10% off your entire order as always all the information you need to know will be listed down below so check it out there but let's go ahead and get started again I'm doing a blind testing on these I would assume with them being gummies one's gonna be like oh right give me one have you like a blue got me so we're either gonna get strawberry blueberry don't know I'll let you know when I taste them but you got your nice a childproof cap here all your safety warnings along the side I do like the simple bottle art and clear label and it's a 7830 VG PG so let's go ahead and give this a vape I have this little 1.9 build on my twisted or my Clapton's provided to me by Yeti wire again I will link that link down below if you're looking for amazing pre-built coils that are very very competitive and support a local business owner check him out he's amazing if you've been to any left shows anywhere over YouTube he is known for some amazing coils and he beats a lot of competitors pricing so enough for that let's go ahead and give reg amis red shirt gummies of 8 and 1 you know what I'm tasting it's almost like a mix between a strawberry and raspberry maybe like a berry guppy demet definitely have it's very very smooth one thing I've noticed with gummy babes they can tend to be very drying this one is not I'm not huge into candy babes but this one isn't overly sweet it's more like a fruit roll-up but tight a gummy if that makes any sense very very very nice and if you hear my boys they're upstairs running around rustling I don't know what they're doing I just hold them together on my way and now they're making a bunch of noise upstairs but all right let's go ahead and drop her in this cotton off and I will go ahead and try the blue shark gummy all right in here is the blue shirt gummy I like this bottle even more of not sure if it's the light blue color or what again these are 30 mils both of these are in three milligram if I find that they have a description I'm pretty sure it's just gonna say blue gummy or any more specifics about the flavours via what the the makers saying I will list them somewhere in the video here as always but again we're gonna drip it on the same are dat same build and get this open breaking that cap for the first time definitely like a blue raspberry blue raspberry um smells like a blue raspberry blow pop it's got an update this one is more candy ask it's definitely like a blue raspberry not a blueberry still really really smooth not overly sweet and not drying which i think is important a lot of as I said before a lot of gummy babes can be very very drawing this one is not but out of the two this one is actually my favorite surprisingly enough I'm not really usually into blueberries or blue raspberries but this one's actually pretty good I really really like it so again you can find these at premium eight supply and also vaping industries calm I hope you guys enjoyed this quick review of both these liquids leave any questions or comments you have down below

"Vhlhp6KWsiE": "hello everybody buuuut the blue pineapple Phoenix here today I'm doing a livestream about you rude with gonnago who is the two people you see right here slob you and Zachary they share a channel and that link will be in the description and Minerva his link will also be in a description so thanks for being here guys said this is a pleasure this dream is just going to be talking about news so the first thing I wanted to talk about is why do you think aru's left the sky islands as he's a priest there and he's been hinted to have a good amount of influence on the island he was in and you would think he had a good amount of power there so some people say he left the sky islands to hunt down and now some people say he left the sky island just for the regular reason for something more to be a pirate what do you think on that subject he was cause he was afraid over now I mean yeah I know what record so we don't look like you know a very bad month renova yeah one of the worst generation the guy with the epic devil with the epic muscle devil fruit yeah the guy who defeated snack snack snack snack is weight from from the girls crew yeah big mom what is happening so are we just having hard time remember mom is one I mean I do have Alzheimer's [Music] we should we moved off topic I think we need to go back onto a rasp pollutant or whether we're talking about yes so why were so huge I personally think he left the Scylla Islands just to become a pirate and maybe possibly to get stronger than a No maybe they were both from the island of Berk the sky island of birth that's where I know is from maybe they were both there and they didn't like each other or something that's true so maybe he did leave the skylines to go but I think he was just left to become a pirate and to get strong maybe to get stronger than an L for revenge or maybe he was his rival something like that he just got bored maybe well there are those warrior monks but the warrior monks just trained and never used to training maybe you just wanted to this training or something he seems like a pretty chill guy though he seems like crazy and not crazy at the same time like if he gets into a fight he just becomes crazy but if he's not in a fight he's a pretty chill guy I'm thinking maybe she was just thirsty for battle and just went to the new world right folks because because remember on sovaldi archipelago when the pasta Feaster came while most people ran he just went up to her and just fodder until he lost and then when he got to the new world he fought snack and then far cracker until he passed out or until cracker knocked him out rather somehow escaped so very much battle even if he's losing good so anyway someone else might be joining yes for the link but so on the subject of your readers devil fruit and it appears to be a doesn't prove that whenever your ruse gets hit here that changing the strengths he and he hits back with he turns his pain and to strength and hits back which is pretty Overtown well guys it's like it's my best friend King King and now we are getting more people hello King you know who is better talking about is I've got no clue good answer I agree okay anyway so why was i okay we were talking yeah yeah beefy boy Louise yeah so like he's actually it seems like an overpowered because he seems like he turned his strength back if that really was the case that would mean like he could defeat anybody sick I don't just punched him then he would punch back like double what you say that they care for them I'm looking at pictures of him right now and this boy he's quite birth in the in the muscle sure but do you know what else is crazy [Music] what that's not even relevant to me boy come on okay well Minerva what do you what do you think what level do you think beef man's at in terms of power no in terms of his devil feel yeah I don't think it's very good at all I think it's pretty good if you're tanky enough don't think it's like it complete it completely depends on how much you can tank and he seems like the guy to tank things because Oh Hank the pacifist uh he tanked the beat down by cracker he seems like he's like they would either show the boy from from seven deadly sins Oh Mellie oh we show the boy Oh sounds good like you can just either one shot him or just restrain him while he doesn't have the power up that's true with a gun die well probably anyone would die unless oh so you have to factor in hockey if he was a good hockey hits at the time then the bullet bounces off in hockey since Murr OSes that all of the worst generation probably has learned talkie by now did that hockey with his duffel food seems like anyone is a hockey player her sake no but snack definitely could use hockey you know usually if snacks got hockey and your Rouge doesn't have hockey you lose probably isn't gonna get him and since the worst enemy in since you're really since you really a 600 plus million belly bounty because snacks bounty was 16 euros meat snack which means his bounty is gonna be above 600 million that's pretty I feel like if you got about to the high your gun and I have to know hockey I mean he could just be really beefy and out beef his opponents yeah I think all to worship it was kind of implied that the whole worst generation all the supernovas have learned hockey during the time skipping late boys granted but you make a you gotta have hockey like muscle hockey wrong yeah well hockey plus muscle yeah that that was a bit of a weird name but just the heart awesome human strength yay vote sure so poacher right now we're talking about huge and his devil fruit like oh where do you how strong do you think his double food is because I'm kind of at this dance it's a bit overpowered since he converts pain into muscle basically but these guys were pointing out that when he doesn't have to power up he seems like it'd be fairly easy to restrain and at the moment we were debating whether or not he would have hockey I might think in order to be this weak commander you kind of need hockey that is my opinion Bru when it comes to this fruit I don't think it's overpowered because um it's more of an activation type fruit like lawsuit lawsuit can be about if he gets speedy blitzed or hurt before or like he gets tricked in some kind of way his fruit is it passive like goofy so it's like even if he's not paying attention luffy's fruit can sometimes save them bruises in life know if he gives I think his is more blunt and concussive damage we haven't seen him take a lot of deep cuts and if he gets cut you know like in half or something you can't convert that because you did so if he can like right the damage but not be crippled you see what you could just convert and then be crippled then he could be like they were a character from real the gray this manga of all time which you should all go read I agree which manga real re al by taki he going away so check it out okay good yeah Oh bad boy vulture before we move on I want to hear your opinion what was at the beginning of this dream which is huge why did he leave the sky island I thought for all the supernovae the whole their our goal was to be barking well I was devastated or in yeah so I think that's what he wanted he wanted to make a crew yeah like all the supernovae before we really started diving deep into they were all set to be new pirates coming up in the new world trying to be barking like they're all Luffy's competition and it we got more involved in killing all like beige kind of just wanted to at one point just take over other mob bosses or kill powerful people but I don't know if he was ever stated that he wanted to but I think he did was leave hurricane I can't remember but I think well I think that he's like a Rouge wanted to just die in one piece well well the thing is the only thing I was thinking about that was well also though I didn't really seem like he wanted to become a Pirate King but that's beside the point she rude was on the sky island where they didn't even know what rubber was and they didn't know anything about the pirate king or and they knew almost zilch about the world government so how did heroes even find out about the Pirate King maybe he saw multiple people have one Scotland before we don't know a ruse could have some kind of weird backstory where another smaller powered crew crept up to what to call it at one point and maybe talk to him gave him some walk he is and inspire him to go like told maybe pull in the store would go logic Roger being computed a number of reasons kid is like you know who's playing with action figures okay so also on the next point of the stream how strong do you think Girish is and the one bistro cuz he beats NAT but in terms from just the worst generation its warlords Janka like how strong is he probably that's a whole different discussion cuz I am a giant warrior advocate to say the least but not going into that I see what you're saying but I'm not sure well Moria as he is is still fairly strong which is why Blackbird wanted him to join his crew but I'm not sure well I'm not sure Moria at its current stage is gonna be taking on snack cuz you know you no good be snack will or presumed to be snack you think just fighting a ridge and walking away or than Rouge taking it I think it rude is stronger than Sanji not strong maybe not stronger but like I don't think Sanji is beating you're rude especially because of how Santi fights and how you huge fights and we know huge is capable of tanking things and since Jean nd especially blunt force since Santi uses blunt force I don't feel like he's gonna be able go against you for samphire besan G we're talking besan G so he can get hit with the blunt damage with the fire the whole other thing I don't know if you can convert that in that I mean I'd say our version based on G of course didn't close man because of fighting style the utility against damage I kind of played that way Jim like weaker than though flemyng go and backer but since he beat I when they said he beat snack it didn't seem like it was vite down it seems like it was almost like Luffy versus cata curry as in it was a very hard and fairly drawn-out bite so he like huge Isabel yeah not that she drunker than much stronger than him so I think and snack it's kind of unprecedented cuz we know Oh next to nothing about him cuz we know he's weaker than cracker and by default I'd say weaker than doflamingo men but if you stronger than Jim Bay or as strongest Jim Bay or I think Jinbei is a cracker though well in the ocean for sure but on land I mean on land that's some impressive things on lands like so we've been land he on land Jim Bay tanked acai noon when stuff but his destructive force on land Tyson besides in his bag of on drill this most powerful attacks that were actually that were actually are inspiring where him throat doing something related to water well firstly we don't know either mm-hm I think you she's about as strong as Jim baby cuz I know some people say Jim Bay is like hunger than doflamingo and stronger than cracker couple people even say some people say he's stronger than leuf even but not not saying anything about Jim Bay in the ocean but Jim Bay on land I don't think he's stronger than cracker don't feel me I don't think Congress be all right neither strong or any of the other straw hats which says Luffy commander level because Luffy couldn't be any of the commanders by himself so far so I don't know how we give someone lower than Luffy they cycle for commanded what he was able to be commanders during dressrosa I'm some become like commanders and uncle Jocko commanders say okay who did he beat in dressrosa that was he didn't beat dopey by himself uh well the thing is people people say that they say Luffy Oh they say log gamma knife no see and he didn't even have enough but I know if you think about it logically that's um that's what you would think but one piece isn't gonna be devoid of potholes and it was basically stated that at the end of dressrosa goofy was stronger than those familiar where was it stated that he was strong enough not stated but implied and like if you just look at it if I don't think any boy come on that doflamingo is stronger than monkey D Luffy he is strong he fought the weaker than Luffy no blows LT wasn't for it was for law and ten minute time gap that Luffy got because of God's and all them he would have died what do you mean yeah he may have been able to uh no it may not be that effective doflamingo is second commander level that first commander level let me go let me go use my excuse that he because we know he came around with that we know what happened that situation he didn't because straight up there and with cracker to he couldn't be corrected without nominees help period there's a new way around it was smashed to cracker the only problem no no he was not no he couldn't no damn it no in the cracker fight the the only thing crack had on Luffy which he kept keep he was cranking off this order so fast Luffy couldn't completely blitzed him but if he had just found a way to let's past all the crackers before cracker can make another one cracker would have been finished no she words he words if he could in these fights look even look at snake man which is very fast like Luffy it's just of course some people call it plan armor but he can only go through these fights if he gets through the fight and if no one was helping him from all three of those fights doflamingo cracker and kata curry he would have made it through the fight to get doflamingo and open and go people say to me that the birdcage fujitora couldn't cut the birdcage so by default go flamingos like basically just an overpower it's like untouchable guy but the birdcage even though couldn't be cut like the futures tour I wanted to he could have just gone up to doflamingo and destroyed him but you didn't because Luffy had to be him for the sake of the storyline but in and that reinforces the point even more he had to beat him for storyline so now on only did law help him but the story writer helped him by giving him so much dick plot armor that he was carried around the plaza for 10 minutes and he didn't like that that is a weakness 10 minutes of not using hockey isn't a Louise she finds horrible weaknesses with his enemies but for some reason his enemies you know what I'm saying like feast and during those two minutes roofies only weakness really is the fact that gear 4 runs out but now oh it's and two chapters ago I believe it was goofy was using Future Sight that well but Luffy was you you think Future Sight at well which means his Future Sight cuz people were saying it wasn't before but now we know it's the same at scatter curry he can just look in whenever he wants future since it's just like sander Sonia did she didn't have Future Sight she wasn't doing the kind of curry like oh I see this he's gonna say this he has that like thing he'd know he can't see there's a facto future now just knows we can in Tennyson Luffy know Luffy thought in the future because remember new feces West space Mickey was telling making yogoro Luffy was telling he oh grows our paw commands moves three times the head before he did and then he Oh gross said you can see the future and Luffy did not deny it he smiled okay being able to perceive what happened a few seconds later can be classified as seeing the future but what I'm saying is he's not on categories level because he doesn't know what pac-man was gonna say he didn't see a picture of a pocket man swiping love he did what he did on that island with Railly when Railly was when Railly was about to hit him over the head with that Club he dodged that he saw what he was about to do and he got out of the way of it all he's doing is a better version of that to where he doesn't have to sit still or closed his eyes he can just do it now and he'd been in a sense the intent of other people around him but it's until we see him see a picture of the future we can't say it exactly like how to cure it as I'm saying he which is still fire that's still a crazy ability but he's just not as good as kind of carrying that's okay there's one difference well even if he can't see as far as Catco he can't deceive there's one thing if what he said you're saying intent this but sand or Sonia only knew what leaf he was going to do a split second before he did luffy called out Parker Mans moves literally like so he all that means he could see further not that he can see a picture of the future that's what I'm getting at he his his better than Senna Sonia's he just can't see a picture that's the only difference is what someone's gonna say what that person look like who's gonna come up like like say if Luke who's gonna be the tag ten seconds from now cata crew would be able to see oh it's a guy in the blue hat with a long sword all Luffy will be able to do is I'm gonna get a hit in ten seconds let me get out of the way there's a difference there but it's not that much she's here I'm saying blue you mind will you my neighbor this ain't it don't anyway me bro you guys do realize that the intent of the stream with the rose as the me and vulture and z-boy young man yeah we did I feel kind of I mean we should have jump in anyway I mean but wait so they they couldn't handle the hockey class they couldn't okay no they could they could they could but anyway I was about to go in people would tell us about your Rouge theories if you have any theories uh I strongly think he is all that stuff if if he could be judged since judge be snacking the roots beats knife I mean a snack did I mean it's nice slipped into a banana peel we all know that Wow so I even even this seen an anime didn't convince you and he was you know surrounded by destroyed environments and stuff ruse out here doing work damn man ain't maintaining but is it you know expound upon blue Canyon now in all seriousness I think a rude he's probably strong I think he might be a little overrated though because I mean he is if he was on a straw hair crew where would he ranked Frankie Lowe maybe not bro-bro snack because he has a 600 million belly bounty and because you'd be him people and since he's hinted to be the weakest Yakima commander of the big mom crew they just assume he's trash but like no Frankie is interested but he's wishers and roasting Robin and wanky which I do not buy into life lady shakes he has a devil no Brooke is not trunk in the freaky if Brooke what is Brooke going to do to Frankie besides just try and I slash him and the ice and the so Brook can't even cut Frankie most likely they can freeze him and spin play he could freeze you this radical being or something how you gonna do that when you're frozen though because Frankie is literally Vega Baker Punk cyborg if they can't handle a little freezing you don't know how powerful Brookes freezing is per se so I'll give you that but I mean it's not trash I'm pretty sure you can freeze metal like what you think he can't freeze metal and then you know what's metals frozen or heated up to a certain point it breaks easier hey Rob hey guys rahrr grew it and stuff left because he had to go to work not because he couldn't handle the hot splash again anyway so I'm thinking he's like if I'm thinking he's about equal to Sanji so okay are you one of the people that say sandy is the third strongest in that ty woods aura nothing it's a different story in djembe is definitely stronger than bass Sanji but sorry face donkey make it definitely hmm but bass Sanji I'm thinking that cuz Jim bass bounty is four hundred million but I think he could Fett is seven hundred million do you agree around a million yeah yeah I think he could be about that because I think he's like stronger I won't give birth to him because he has been a sheshe Buca and then we broke up I read and he's associated with Luffy so I feel like his connections more than his raw physical ability to do harm to the government it just the thing the thing we haven't seen the true side of Jim because what Jim Bay's Forte will be like in the sea he's probably the he's the strongest fisherman basically and if he's in the ocean we don't know what he can do and what the fisherman pirates do as we go under boats and completely you wreck them like djembe can tour tear a giant hole through a ship with a giant sea torrent but like Ramallah that's more Dziedzic put a like weak point like no no I'm saying like in the water you ate a lot of people could do stuff to the ship I'll give white beer or something like Carrie booth came up from under you on the ship and was like throwing missiles at you he could destroy a ship well the ship wasn't the point the point was that Jim Bay Ken like manipulate the ocean underwater and that could and it's like it's bounty based solely on strength well probably I don't think that's that impressive in comparison to a lot of other people though I feel like if we talking about his bounty 700 million that were asked a question how much evenings oral should be ah the well I mean mmm because he he his didn't move after okay great or something like that not okay but like when the bounties went up his and really go up that much Zoro is almost kinda I remember when you know I don't know what I think of all because and by the way guys let's just completely ditch the whole huge discussion because we're gonna keep getting sidetracked let's just we should I think 100 yeah so Xaro he's kind of cuz I was I don't think of them cuz people were saying he's like stronger than doflamingo which I wasn't really giving him I was like at best with a gigantic stretch he is a strongest doflamingo and that would be trash writing by Oda Zorro and oh but then mister because um oh sorry good but then they give you is more like a it's Jim bear bit stronger but then he got one shot by commas oh and it's not what commas Oh is weak but seriously hmm it's a tough way is it tougher because uh I don't see commas Oh being some secret badass that we now have to start putting in top 30 streams like a tweet like we find out that commas oh here's some like the note he was like the number-two guy or some [ __ ] for like a long time I don't think that's gonna happen so Zorro getting hit with that sword really does kind of I think the same way Luffy is trying to find a way to be trying to be Kaito Zhou was trying to find a way to kind of give himself more of a durability against other swordsmen and [ __ ] like that hit him getting cut like kind of opened his eyes and now he's gonna be working on his own like me like maybe Zorro finds a way to approach that the full body armor hockey in a different way than move he is like Luffy's going after grandpa yo and asking him you know how do I do this I'm trying to punch somebody without punching him and he's always trying to find a way to like actually have a pseudo armor on him during battle almost like big mom you know okay I think if he was would be able to do something like that enough his durability he would definitely I think he would definitely be over it but yeah I've been meaning at so y'all gonna do a y'all top Barry together I haven't thought about Luke we can oh yeah cuz a man means I'll be a promoter at the end like yeah you want to see they part to go check out their channels you obviously haven't yeah yeah a pardon but know this like there's our done we haven't done our yet if you want to again if we if you just want to start over and do a whole new one now just ask me of y'all y'all doing it oh yeah well I was talking to blue trying to see what he wanted if we can I'm down if not then whatever we can talk about it after the stream ends which sadly we'll have to end about now because I have some duties that are calling me so thanks for watching everyone if you enjoy my content and only if you draw my Conte like this video subscribe and turn on notifications for more one piece content also check out votre

"[Music] welcome back to the channel ladies and gentlemen I am Matt hope you're all doing well today we are gonna check out the ephah nano pods I think it's Aoife i feh I pH a nano pods these guys have made some other pod pod systems in the past that have been fairly popular but it's the first product of theirs that I have taken a look at these are a disposable 3-pack of pods yes I know a lot of you guys do not like disposable pods I will give you my thoughts on them towards the end of this video but I do definitely want to see how these match up to some of the others on the markets I do use them once in a while concerts super stealth vaping stuff like that so let's go and dive into it this is what your packaging is going to look like now this is the pineapple you pull the sleeve off and inside you have three individually wrapped pods and inside each box you have your pod that's wrapped up let's go ahead and open this up Oh pulling the plug out now and slide the pot out let's go ahead and pull the plug out of the mouthpiece now these are longer than some of the other disposable pods out there there's a stick it's longer but skinnier see that I will say best build quality out of a disposable pod that I have seen so far all the others have been plastic this one actually has some metal it's feels like aluminum then a plastic mouthpiece plastic bottom speaking of that mouthpiece there we are it's very thin 1.8 ohm coil in here one-and-a-half ml of liquid and the battery is 280 milliamp hours they say you're gonna get between 200 and 400 puffs it's just kind of a broad range so I would guess around 300 most of the time now on the bottom there you have your airflow Inlet says nano right there with the flavor and all the ones that I got are four point nine percent nicotine so 49 milligrams I don't know if they're gonna be doing it or not but I would like to see them come out with a lower Nick strengths like a 25 or 30 milligram salt now these aren't color coded or anything like that the flavors are just on the back I got a blueberry a light she lush ice mango ice a pink lemonade and of course the pineapple that I showed you guys all right guys very quick up close let's go ahead go up top we're gonna test all these flavors and I'll give you my thoughts on disposables as a whole and how these compare to other disposables on the market all right here's the ephah or i fuh nano this is the pineapple let's go and vape that I want a vape it next to a stick here it's a much warmer vape than the stick and the flavor pops thrill more than the stick let's go ahead and bait the blueberry it's blueberry with a little bit of cooling agent the pineapple has a little cooling agent as well just a little bit of mint there mango ice that's good as well pink lemonade light Chi whoo getting nicked out and he lush ice that's pretty good as well as far as my favorites go I would have to say the pineapple and the lush ice are both really good the lush ice is like a watermelon ice type of flavor I'm not sure if they're using the same flavor that's in the stig's lush ice or not but it's that same type of flavor now as far as other flavors that I didn't show here there's also a cake and a tobacco I mean just comparing these two other disposable pod systems it's a warmer vape than most and the flavor shines through more it's a little bit tighter draw than most of them as well now as far as what are disposable pod systems like this good for definitely not for everyday use I always preach that it's a lot of waste it doesn't make a lot of sense you could save money doing a refillable pod or even some other pod system where you just by you know prefilled pods but I do use these on occasion Vanessa and I have gone to a couple concerts this summer I brought a disposable pod system for that we went to Disneyland with the kids I brought a disposable pod system for that so it's good when you want something small it's not a huge deal if you lose it or whatever it makes sense in those types of applications but it's not something that just kind of like with disposable tanks not something that's good to use every day now the build quality on these is better than any other disposable pod I have seen you do have some metal in here and as far as the environment is concerned I think that that would be better than all plastic because it's you know you have more recyclables here I'm assuming but that depends on how you dispose of these as well I like to see these these disposable pots as some companies have you know some type of mail-in program where you can mail them back in you know and they give you a credit or whatever and they dispose of them properly now as far as cons go you know it's a little bit larger than the stick but it is thinner but there's not really anything else to complain about here other than the fact that you know it's a disposable pot it is what it is as far as pros go like I said build quality is better than any of the others I have tried I actually like to draw on these better than any of the others I have tried it's a tighter draw and it's a warmer vape the flavors better on them oh but one other con is it would be nice if they had other nicotine concentrations maybe a 25 milligram or something like that the flavors are really good on this it's very satisfying I'm definitely going to keep these and going to be using them when I want a disposable pod system like I said concert stuff like that mouthpiece is very comfortable actually like that thin mouthpiece on these so all in all for a disposable pod I'm impressed the build quality on these is just as nice as non disposable pod systems out there on the market I mean it feels like you know aluminum it feels like a jewel or something well one other thing if you can see right there there's a light goes green when you're puffing on it wanted to make sure you guys can see that now as far as price goes I'm not sure yeah I've seen that some distros have this but I haven't seen any of the retailers sell it yet so I'm not sure how much it's going to be but it definitely rivals some of the others out there on the market and has better vape quality than the really popular ones like the stig so quick video on these little show-and-tell let's go ahead and end it there folks that about wraps it up until next time thanks for watching suck my mud", "8VUWhJNx7gA": "hello there and welcome to another episode of occu review I'm Callum I'm James and today for you we have got a review of the Kent Futura blue so overseas these are an equivalent to their HD filters and all those kind of all those kind of ones so yeah we're getting not and first and foremost I'm just going to apologize for the lighting I've got it's not my two phones shining torches to us because you know it's wintertime and the Sun Goes Down early so I mean currently it's 5:22 yep and about bloody ten degrees will be right if that yep so as I said Kent future blues those yours now these ones in particular have an interesting filter in them as you can probably see there are full white filter fairly Nasser's aren't so I thought its plane because they're planned packaging laws but they're quite nice the filters sort of got three stages in it this one so it's got three different sort of filters in it so it's got a it's got a like a compact one at the start and around the perforations in the middle it's sort of like a softer filter and then then again at the end for probably about half a centimeter it's a nice firm one again so that's that's obviously supposed to do something to the smoke here so it is a blue rated cigarette I mean off the bat I'm already really liking it yeah so smoke these before we've calendar we never got around to doing one do it no I've never bought a pack of these I've always just blood off in there yeah yeah they're probably the choice of blue cigarettes that we'd smoke we like our Reds but yeah for blues and I've got one mate these are the tobacco it's actually darker then it was in the Winfield Reds that we did the other day so that's that's quite interesting Kent there another product of the British American Tobacco Company so it's obviously gonna be a quality cigarette just from looking at this there's not too much root or stem in the mix so that further ado let's work on spy [ __ ] he's already done it trust your be quiet I have a good bit of body to him is what I do for a blue cigarette it's a really good body I'm sorry I'm shivering a bit Simon short sleeve and t-shirt so our slashes short sleeve t-shirt and shorts yeah off the bat there didn't get any paper I don't pack these ones down because if I find if you do this the drawings more restricted and you don't get as good a burn but yeah I'm gonna take a drag and I already know what I think but let's get it down on the video you know I approve okay the drags nice and firm and it's smooth so you feel a little bit of a hit on the back of your throat because it's a Blues not a very strong cigarette it's fairly good I think over over here these are 0.9 milligrams of Thai and I'm not sure about the nicotine content so they're only a few milligrams below red but they're very nice cigarette even with all the chemicals added in them and everything I think it's time for death drag might still going and I hate tobacco how good he's lit shaking I don't know how you do that I can't do that oh yeah you let go on the X it's already vlogs now so oh yeah you know I gotta go test the body as we already said it's pretty good but I'm just gonna check the say penis on it so yeah guys see if we're getting any tingly on my tail and tars what are y'all feel - looking alone oh it's looking like drag but the tars are really pronounced I found that as well just like I'm gonna do this body test here we go I can't feel my tongue but that's okay because that was worth it cuz that was some very nice soapy thick body and from a blue cigarette that is very very impressive so as he said these are product of a british-american buffer so that they're gonna be a good cigarette and for a 20 pack of these it cost me thirty one dollars eighty so that's that's honest saying like they're they're good Seerat they're not cheap over here so compared to my 23 packet down here all roads which ops we just cost 30 to 50 for an extra three cigarettes it's about on par but these are differently a you know an upmarket cigarette and they're not very common like Ivan really saved them anyway apart from our local server which is interesting because they don't really what about the tobacconist no I went in the ESG a couple weeks ago and I didn't have any cancer go figure yeah and did he throw your buck damn it got a fish threw my ashtray there's a few butts of it oh the ones that don't end up on the side of the road that is that smells lovely with dates if you smoke them too quickly you are going to notice that the ash starts to sharpen like a pencil and you burn all your draw will get quite warm so with the Kent's you don't want to smoke them too quick and the thing that I like about these is because because I do a lot of talking when I'm smoking cherry I like it when my cigarettes stay lit when I talk so that's that's another no it's not a prop to the really glue there's a yeah so it's showing the different stages there's the first entrance oh don't worry he does picked up it has picked up the first stage of the filter so yeah there's three different stage so Charlie the second one and yeah it probably won't look oh my god that is or is it just two so it looks like there's a third one in the end the inside of the paper is stained Brown from his deck drag what what is that yeah so that looks like mold oh that's a charcoal these ones they got charcoal in the filters just sort of alarm and if you can see that but there's a few black spots that's the charcoal in there and obviously that's going to catch the tar and supposedly filter out all the bad things and isn't so the third stage is the same size as the first stage these are the worst to pick apart just lazy he's never had this much trouble picking apart mind you he's got fingers like a gorilla so he's not very good at this that with that piece of tosser now towards the end of the cigarette the flavour does change it gets a bit stronger I've found okay I've kind of butchered that line that's right you know tiny tiny filter yeah so it's probably about tiny tiny and brass innovator maybe but um there's our state now the paper on the edge of the tobacco here actually burns quite nicely and it's not tuna task as I was saying the paper it's not too profound which is good because it's a very thin paper construction the tobacco as I've gone through it's been very nice it's been consistent take a whiff of that ash no you got your cigar actually oh that's what smells like everything oh boy anyway so wrapping up on the Kent's I reckon they're a fantastic blue cigarette over here I would probably recommend them and if I rate him highly he's gonna smoke a blue it's going to be the Kent's and that's saying something because he likes these cigarettes strong yeah anyway guys as always drop us comments in below tell us what your favorite blue cigarette is we'll all be interested we'll both of us would be interested to see that for our next episode we're gonna do a rolly cigarette review so we're gonna get a made on who's a really good roller it's fantastic like you're all gonna like image names I can't roll you can't roll no we can't roll anywhere near exact can yeah the names Zack is real good like anyway we really can to get this episode out we've had a request from one of our subscribers for it so that's going to go ahead and exit next episode what are we gonna do well Christmas for JPS red but I'm not sure what he's most Winnie Gold doesn't it yeah a Port Royal Port Royal I reckon is probably the best catch tobacco hatch but tobacco like my champion legendary Ruby that's quite nice mix there but everyone's different so we can't guarantee that sorry JPS red because you know these it costs us money and make these episodes I only smoke so the JPS gold yeah sodas are gonna be Jo fierce wind filter Port Royal in here anyway well just know as I said before drop in the comments below what kind of blue cigarettes you like we became know that anyway wherever you guys are in the world spark up for a spark up first we appreciate it and we'll be hearing from you soon thanks guys", "pArx4ztPRRk": "welcome to community canvas review today i'm doing a um another impromptu review like half mine seem to be now on a buddy's live resin distillate syringe you'll see that i'm struggling with it because for some reason you can kind of see i'll let go of it there um it seems like the air is under pressure and literally so i got about halfway um back home and then opened it up while i was parked waiting for my girlfriend somewhere and it just like poured out of the little tube the back of the plunger had blown out basically i think it was expanding or something and i took it back with the receipt and luckily they exchanged it for another one which as soon as they took out another one in store same thing happened what to the bud tender not even to me so he went through about two or three of them and found one that's like vaguely still has all the um oil in there at least towards i'm yeah all the oil's still in there and you just let me kind of hold it like this but it seems like all their product is kind of screwed sucks for them but i'm not sure what the issue is with that um i don't know if that's happening to the other distillers they have as well or if it's just buddies something that they didn't do terribly well couldn't really tell you so i'm gonna fill it up real quick right here on cam because we literally ran home just to be able to put this in the cart so i didn't waste it all i'm gonna also try and take off the cap here in a way that doesn't have it just shoot out if i can there we go all right it's already slightly coming out under pressure it's dripping down fairly well it's definitely a terpe mixture despite me not having any heat applied to it i definitely should have done that first but again i really can't do much with this right now besides whatever it wants to see if i can take the pressure off it finally though alrighty um so that's what it's starting to look like i'm gonna cancel the in the recording real quick try and take care of this in a little more controlled manner and i'll let you know what i think of it all right so um i've gotten it all taken care of here um i left the package in the car so maybe i'll just upload a picture or something like that but it's buddies blue frost crossed with platinum purple coming in at eleven point eight zero percent terpenes two point eight seven eight seven percent beta cardio filling two point three eight percent transpharmacene 1.88 percent limiting and this is the dominant ones so got it all taken care of here um always leave a little bit in drippers because i like dabbing it as well and trying it both ways try it on the vessel man that's tasty as [ __ ] i like that a lot not only that um first thing i noticed right off the bat is something that i always notice with the liquid or liquid diamonds live resin from buddies is that perfect perfect pool like every time you pull on the cartridge it's like the perfect amount of resistance every time perfect consistency thinness especially considering i'm using this all ceramic cart the flavor is just coming through unreal trying to get it to focus but doesn't seem to want to work there no worries because i'm going to be buying more of these i don't care if they didn't work i'll just check them before they leave the store this time already next time i suppose these are really good and i paid i think 25 or something like that because i got some crazy deal they applied for me i'm definitely getting a lot of furnacing um but anytime that there's cardiophiline or um miracin as the dominant terpene i feel like it masks a lot of the other ones so this one definitely does that oil quality though is insane it's great especially for the price that i paid i mean this is yeah that's just good you look for yourself you judge that alrighty um i'll try and get another video because i got another budget brand that looks half decent so i'll try and get another video out possibly once i get back from the store today so um like and subscribe if you enjoyed the video if you didn't like and subscribe it helps i think i don't actually know i don't know how you do youtube works but um i like smoking weed and recording it so thanks for watching have a great day you", "iuKteM_gUgk": "[ __ ] i am not a role model my girlfriend my girlfriend i play playstation while my girlfriend counts my money the [ __

customer service requests for which is basically how to clean and maintain your tank or how do you get the most usable life out of your throwaway tank several people are refilling these and you want to get the most number of uses or you want to get them cleaned up so this video is basically gonna run through how to clean up your tank maintain it get it back to you level whether it's a complex tank like our sub old carbon fiber a Cannabis Cup winning tank or whether it's a simple 5-10 thread thing fact the matter is as you use on certain oils certain terpene profiles get in there certain areas get gummed up they don't get cleaned you want to get the taste out get your tank back to new level and this video is going to give you some really useful tips on how to do that so Before we jump into the video I don't know what type of level of Pro cleaning you guys are into but I'm gonna go to the extreme and basically supply all of the equipment that you will need in the worst possible case scenario so you are prepared for everything so let's go over what I have here I just have a couple tanks so I poured some dark eliquid into I don't believe in wasting CBD or medical oils I let them sit for a week so that so that they they get a little bit discolored and they go and get on to the gaskets and get all over the insides of tank I had my guys keep them upside down and whatnot so we can get the tank dirtied up a little bit just enough so we can show you guys how to clean it so we have our example tanks then over here let's get a nice little shot I've had this for a couple of years this is actually a little coiler kit that I bought off of Amazon anybody who's into vape mods vaporizers or small things for 10 bucks or 15 bucks whatever I paid for on Amazon it is super useful I use it in here in my office taking apart vaporizers - tampering with small things constantly I mean for 10 15 bucks you can't beat it it's called a mod coiler kit it comes with these really useful little ceramic tweezers so there don't conduct static electricity they come with these almost like like a little dental tool so you grab little small gaskets and little bitty things you can play some with small screwdrivers with all different types of sets scissors thanks for 10 bucks if you're tampering around these things definitely an awesome investment we have our tanks always good to have rubber gloves before you start cleaning your tank these things are gunky some of them are borderline gross you know the oil gets slippery the rubber does give you a good grip when you're taking the tanks apart much easier to throw away the gloves than to you know try to scrub off your skin afterwards the key component that you're gonna need whether you need any of the other things or not is isopropyl alcohol there's over 90 percent purity this stuff is not going to mess up your electronics do not use soap and water to clean your tanks or anything they'll come in contact with electricity only use isopropyl alcohol this stuff kills all the bacteria will definitely break down any type of oils that are stuck to the gaskets in your tank it's gonna give it a nice clean smell it's not gonna mess up your electronics this is your best bet to getting your tank close to you you can pick these up at any grocery store any type of you know CVS Walgreens little convenience shop usually will have this or you could order it online then I bring some styrofoam cups some thick styrofoam cups this is what I set out my bets are basically my little quarantine centers in two and then I have paper towels they do not particle eyes you don't want to use the types of the types of paper towels or napkins that once they get wet and you and you try to turn on them like almost like a toilet paper that they can particle eyes or fuzz up because you don't want that stuff in your tank coming in contact with your electronics it is just not going to be good so any type of paper towel that doesn't really particle eyes once it's gotten wet that just absorbs will be good for what we're doing so let's jump right into it let's get our gloves on and let's perform some open-heart surgery here all right first things first my first cup is gonna be like tobacco chewers not a big fan with polar spit cup where I'm going to dump my residue is it getting wasted or CBBC here we are simply using discolored thick and hardened to e-juice so I'm gonna get out whatever I can get out there upside down then what I'm gonna do is I'm going to start disassembling the tank into as many parts as I can while I wait I don't want to get my glass all dirty so put on paper towels so then I'm going to start a little isopropyl alcohol bath where I'm gonna take these cups and put some isopropyl alcohol in them for the various parts as you can see I fill them up about a quarter way just so the components can become submerged now make sure that when you disassembled your tank you remember kind of what you're doing so that you reassemble your thing properly so now that this has pretty much soaked away I'm going to remove the glass piece and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take off all gaskets and separate them put them into one of my little bath cuffs I'm gonna have one of my bath tubs b4 gaskets that gaskets off could need my tweezers to get this one out make sure that you remove all of your gaskets because a lot of times if you don't remove them and you get them lost when you're assembling or disassembling your tank and then you put your tank back together you're missing a gasket you cannot have a good connection or you can have leakage which you definitely do not want to do now when it comes to the sub ohm tank you don't want to remove these bottom gaskets here because they are your seal between your glass and your base and just removing them wears them out a little bit more so you want to keep those as good as possible so we're not going to remove these those are tight on the base we don't want those to become looser now you're gonna remove your heater you might have to put some muscle into it you might have to get some pliers because some of that residue might have been down there it might have hardened and this could be oily and slippery this ejuice propylene glycol I'm definitely feeling that slippery on my gloves so in the event that this is hard to unscrew a bigger set of pliers or you know or you gonna get a really put a little muscle into it yeah it was definitely on there pretty tight so I'm going to take this away now if you are cleaning your heater make sure that you get it into an isopropyl bath but most of the time when people are cleaning their subloan tanks they're just gonna want to switch it off once they clean it with a brand new heater to top it off so we're actually not going to put the heater into the best since we're gonna give it a brand new heater since we're essentially rebuilding the tank here with this so we're gonna give the bottom base a nice little bath and that is also going to bathe with the mouthpiece make sure it's fully submerged if it's not always just add a little bit of isopropyl we're gonna drop the glass in with the gaskets because it's not that dirty heater we're gonna throw away and the top piece which has the airflow control we're gonna put into a separate uh separate bath there now this guy is not fully submerged so I'm gonna add a little bit I'm gonna make sure that it is fully submerged there you can see and while I let those absorb generally what I like to do is depending on how dirty the tank is I'll leave it in there for probably four hours it's just to really let it soak up let is sterilized let the parts break down you'll come back and depending on what type of oil or CBD you have in there you'll come back and it will look like the eye so the clear isopropyl is now like Coke or coffee or something like that you know so depending on how dirty is what you had in there but I would say leave it in there for a few hours on the minimum and go from there sometimes people even say you know if they set this up at night they go to sleep and then they put it back together in the morning the longer you let it sit in there generally the deeper of a clean you're gonna get for cleaning purposes we're just gonna let it sit while I set up and show you guys how to clean a 510 threaded tank so we're gonna take our 510 thread tank that we have filled up with some yellowish ejuice here all you could do is you're going to unscrew the top piece there's any residues in there you're going to take the spit cup here and you're going to dump it out this is obviously thickened and hardened so there really is only a little bit of drops coming in and out now there we go it's kind of shaking out the is really much thicker you can remove the mouthpiece here because we will clean that - no you're gonna do is reassemble is appropriate we were just gonna let the tank submerge the tank body submerged in there and next to it we're gonna have a little mouthpiece submerged in there then we're just gonna let it sit and we're gonna let it bathe with these generally it helps because you can't take the tank apart in the cept several pieces like we can wear sub ohm tank it comes apart into about four pieces this is only one piece and because that center post that you have in the tank there's not a lot of area for that liquid to get into so when you're cleaning this it's not a bad idea to just kind of slosh it around for a little bit kind of wiggle it around to make sure the alcohol is working its way into the tank and into the heater is generally you gotta just I just spilled that isopropyl all over the place but you just kind of wiggle it around and then let it sit make sure that there's isopropyl getting into there now the next thing that we're gonna do off is before you would start any type of reassembly is you want to make sure that you clean off your tools because you just use these tools this is the one that I really used that was dirty I don't want to get the dirty residues back into a clean tank that is the last thing that I want to do so clean your tools you simply take a nice clean paper towel soaking a little bit of isopropyl you can clean off all the areas that you would have touched make sure it's nice and sterile now to be extra extra cautious while I'm cleaning my tank I'm actually for the final phase I'm going to remove my dirty gloves that have eliquid on them and all different types of tank residues and I'm going to give my tools here a little final final touch always get a little smell test that smells like clean isopropyl let that dry and we are gonna get some new gloves and we are gonna come back and now we're going to talk about reassembling the tank alright guys we've got some fresh clean gloves and we are back to start reassembling the tanks so as you can see here you can view the cups you can see that my isopropyl is definitely discolored and we didn't let it sit overnight I said we let it sit for like 10-15 minutes while we're showing you the other tank if that and this is just strictly an example but if you let it sit for a few hours you're definitely gonna get a lot more discoloration the liquid in the more discolor it is the better sometimes if you want to go the extreme once a liquid becomes discolored you take the components out and plort it into a clean isopropyl bath you know again that depends on the magnitude of cleanliness that you want to go and how you really want to let this stuff sit but now what I do is I set up what I call a little drying station well I take the paper towels that I had and I fold them up so I can basically take the components out of the isopropyl bath and allow them to dry Oh as much intro track as you can and for our little tank we are actually going to take that out and with 510 tanks what you want to do you want to try to let them sit upside down just let all the isopropyl to drip out now this this guy wants to tip over a little bit so we're gonna do these and this guy we want him to be upside down as well it's a little isopropyl drip down and that's going to take a little bit of a while if you want to spread out speed up the process of getting the isopropyl out of tank you can always use a hairdryer use either the hairdryer if you have it only take each setting from a distance or use it on the non heat setting on just a cool setting because if you hit it with a heat gun or something like that or hiking you do run the chance of compromising the integrity or warping the gaskets or the rubber pieces of tank so do not use any of those natural drying is usually the best or use a hairdryer but don't use it on a higher heat setting or each setting at all so now what I do with each one of these little components I haven't given it much much of a chance to dry put this guy off to the side I haven't given it much of a chance to dry so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take a clean cloth clean rag and I'm actually gonna clean and dry the glass and all the components within the tank to make sure move any residue and all so that I get it as dry as possible in the short amount of time so we can do this video do it properly okay that's nice and clean the base it looks brand-new it's nice and dry I'll see any isopropyl so this one's ready to go now if my gaskets I'm also gonna dry them off whatever you do don't pull on your gaskets like the rubber bands that weakens them it shortens the life of them it does compromise the integrity of the gaskets so be gentle with them don't flex on them in other words that's nice try it's back to white it was pretty yellow before we clear it into the eye on the alcohol that there so that one's done clean up this long these aren't exactly the most form-fitting gloves but you get the picture never clean off the mouthpiece generally a lot of residue with these sub ohm tank builds up around the edges so if you want to you take a little bit of isopropyl you just dip the cloth in there to give her a real final scrub you can really get a nice clean on it there even kind of fold up the towel towel a little bit clean the inside yeah you get that as good as new see no it's much better there you go now let me get a dry paper towel I can even clean the internals here a little bit oh yeah that's nice that's basically bringing you there and again you can use a q-tip you can go much more extreme I'm just really trying to give you guys the basics now we go dry long dry this guy off here okay now let's get to the bottom base a lot of times oil will set up in there the isopropyl actually did a really good job of just getting that out as you can see I haven't touched it since we pulled it out of bath so for this one you can take some isopropyl a really scrub down but in this event I don't see that as being necessary I'm just gonna go ahead and just dry it out give it an extra little clean I mean this doesn't look bad at all I suppose I mean the e-liquid and the ISO the isopropyl got rid of a liquid stains rather well just by even dipping it into that sometimes with different oils or CBeebies you could have a little bit of a tougher time you might have to give it a couple baths and a couple cleans but like I said case-by-case basis you will know exactly how far to make it so that's done there now we're gonna get the top air flow piece for this you want to twist around the airflow piece sometimes you get residue caught in the middle there or on different ends always good to twist it around to get the inside this gasket also removes because we didn't actually use this tank much there was really nothing caught in there it looked pretty new but you can actually remove it also so you can see because we didn't use it there wasn't any residue trapped in there but you could have removed this gasket also and dropped it into the bath with the gasket so we're just not gonna best so we're just gonna clean off the outside of it it's sat in the bath this will be fine get this we're going to dry off the inside and again if you want let these sit out natural air dryer more it might be better or if you just blow dry them off we're really doing an express job just to not make this video seven hours and for us to get it done so that now the most important part is is not to forget your gaskets so you want to make sure that you drop in your gaskets now with the sub ohm tank what's very critical about it is that you have a gasket that goes into each side of where the glass interacts so one of your gaskets is gonna go right here into the very top of the mouthpiece let me get these form-fitting gloves a little bit better you want to go in there you can take your little tweezers I'm gonna push them down to make sure it's in the crevice nice and easy just kind of go around don't poke the gasket to compromise it that gaskets in there nice you want to take that put your glass in there you gotta feel it line up then your other gasket is going to go inside the crevice on your bottom base you're gonna want to make sure you drop it in there it drops them there good because otherwise that will give you bottom leaking because your tank most the time sits upright so if you had to pick one of the two to do perfectly this is definitely the one the top gasket really compromises only if you leave your tank upside down or on its side with the air vents over so you put this one is good to your bottom base now we could have cleaned up the heater but in this event I just grabbed a new one this is a sub ohm heater you can pick them up on the website they come in five packs I already took the liberty of removing it out of five pack that's brand new then you're gonna want to screw it on to the tank you want to get a nice tight screw you're gonna feel the two pieces of metal connect you don't need all the time if you when you're cleaning your tank the next time you're gonna fight with it that much more get a nice good hand tight where you feel the metal connect and it's making electrical connection you're not gonna get any bottom leakage and then you're going to connect the glass and you're gonna screw the actual body of the tank together with screws into here and you want to get it tight don't want to over tighten it don't want to put too much pressure on the gasket is completely unnecessary then you're gonna take it you're gonna fill it prime it that's the place you do it but before you do that you want to do a quick atomizer check to make sure you did everything right in your tank works screw the top piece on and then you can do an atomizer check this is a brand new tank out of the box that hasn't been used and I gotta say if we do a close up even though we rushed through the cleaning procedure I mean this is this is pretty closely it's not a bad job for doing it really quickly and we could have done a little bit better but basically looks brand new so now we're gonna do an atomizer check before we fill it up because the worst possible thing you can do that we've gotten a lot of angry phone calls and we don't want this to be an angry phone call if somebody just goes to the process of cleaning their tanks takes a gram of very expensive distillates or something puts it in there and they didn't do something right or the heaters not working and now they're in a big dilemma where they just dumped a whole syringe in there and we don't want to be the cause of your frustrations so do a quick atomizer check to make sure you put the tank together properly you're all cleaned up and dried out what you're good is you just screw it onto a battery of 510 battery you're going to turn it on in most of the time when you turn it on it'll already give you an atomizer resistance reading right here it says point 5 ohms if we get good close up of that right here in the lower corner you'll get a resistance reading you see that resistance reading generally that means that you have an electrical connection now what you're gonna do then is you're gonna turn your wattage all the way down all the way is down as far as it goes then you're gonna push the fire button and as long as the timer starts don't leave the timer on a long time because then you could get a burnt taste in there burn up the coil but as long as the timer starts you know that you did a good job and that tank is gonna work and you put everything back together properly the atomizer you put in there's legit everything is good on that end so now you can take this tank and you can go through the priming and filling procedures that you would as if you purchase the tank from us a brand new so now that showed you exactly how to maintain and clean the most complex tank that we offer and it's not is only going to be easier than that one I promise you so we're gonna jump right back to the tank that has been sitting upside down now what you're going to want to do with this is now it has an isopropyl in it so you can see there's still a little isopropyl in it so you have two real options you could do here is you can take a very nice thin piece of thin piece of napkin and you can use your tweezers and actually get inside there to get it out to kind of spin and twist it around that might take you a while or you can use a blow dryer trip on this one - is he use make sure that you get it nice and dry on the inside I actually take my glove off for this one because this is a little bit more delicate than these gloves weren't exactly sized for me the glove does not fit so what you do is you take your napkin sorry not a napkin your paper towel you can roll it up into a nice little fine braided string so it has a little bit of substance and it's ultra thin then you get this string in there you get it between the center post the inside of the tank and you can actually kind of move it around and get any remaining pieces of the isopropyl out it's working just fine here it's gonna take you a little bit of time because a very thin very small very delicate so I honestly suggest using the blow dryer method or letting it sit upside down for a few hours that will definitely work for you too once you've gotten basically all of the isopropyl particles little droplets out of there you know that you will be all set to check to see if the tank works and get another fill on it including these little 510 tanks if you're putting different strains in there or if it stops not performing but it still works that's because there's residue gummed up in there you want to get a better taste out of each one to make sure it's a taste neutral and you get Paul residues out definitely good idea to clean your tank before you fill it this one I can still feel my hands it has a little bit of isopropyl on so it's good dry it off get inside the mouthpiece get the air holes now when you screw it back together and we're gonna do the atomizer test we're just going to use this mod battery remember when using your honey stick carbon fiber that carbon fiber battery you're gonna use a five ton tank on it make sure you flip the ego adapter upside down otherwise it won't read and it won't work so you flip it upside down let's turn it off move this little silicon protector screw it on now we're going to turn our battery on as you can see now it's registered at one point three ohms which is actually the factory specs for the tank as you get residues and they're dirty the resistance will actually go up on the ohms so now we push it oh wow I even heard it hissing there actually burned off some of that a little isopropyl and I still be trapped in there but now we know we clean up the tank the resistance is back to the factory specs on the original heater and it is ready to vape so this is a good way to clean you little 510 tanks get a little bit more life out of them get a little bit more usage out of them and when you're going in between tanks to make sure you're clean and pure so for this and several other cool pro tips make sure you subscribe to our channel give this video a thumbs

conform i'm here today to make a review for Hanson that we have two liquids to drink liquids in this case not tobacco fruit these are drinks illegals okay what we have here today we have read mg and we have blue color okay so we're going to take out these still if it's from their boxes and you can see the boxes has four drinks have the scholar in a brownie red color all of them come out so there are easy crew to identify if you've bought fruit tobacco and drink boxes ok so let's start by the collar as you can see this is one is red energy red energy of course the caller had to be read this one stands out for the Red Bull ok and we have the blue color already made the review for coal up which is coca-cola of course but blue column is supposed to be similar to the taxi so we're going to try this to indicate today already have my asics ready we will try again on trip because rip for me and for many experienced vapors is the one choice for testing Ellie please ok so that's not why the red energy will be trying the same first will be seen what the scent of the liquid is then we'll be very straight to the venue ok so let's stop by the red energy well as for the smell it really feels like Red Bull but I can feel it quite well a taste of taste in this case in this case the smell of bubble gum but let's go into the vaping and see what we have here in disposal really good really candy flavor does it this is it similar to the to the READ&WRITE bull yes for me it's clearly a good choice if you want to buy something that's close to rebel it's not quite has a red bull because it has a type of bubblegum flavor in it but it's quite similar when you inhale the vapor you can feel quite well the flavor of a redbull when you exhale you can feel quite well also a type of problem that's what you that's what you keep in your mouth you feel like a bubble gum candy in your mouth but it's close to a redbull so this red energy to me it's a quite excellent liquid to to purchase because it's really close to a redbull also for me I have tried many red red bull similar air liquids this one is one of the best because it's quite similar end okay let's go around the blue color first the scent of course let's see Wow if you are here in my spot you will all save also say well because it's it really really feels like Pepsi I'm not saying this is very different from the color but for me as I already tried the color already made a video review for home call you can feel really the difference but let's see innovating what they have any sport oh my god what can I say I pie this is so different from the cola this really looks this really feels like a pest it I can't believe it it's so different from the color the a liquid color I tried in made a review of it really feel like the whole it doesn't have the sweetness that Pepsi has this one has the if you know if you are a user or consumer of coca-cola and Pepsi you're all different scope whole is much stronger in gas but doesn't have the taste in the sweetness of pepsi in the liquid it's the same when you vape the coca-cola you can feel the throat hit and taste of home color in this one the sort it is also a good throat it but you can feel it's the simple the sweetness of the Pepsi it's unbelievable how can they how can they make this liquids so close to the actual flavor they can be really similar this Pepsi one this case blue color it's just perfect head for the cooperation of the two red energy it's really close but it has a taste of problem in it so it's not quite the Red Bull ok as for the blue color oh my god leads it's almost the same it really feels like Pepsi even if I didn't try it if they gave me a controller liquid in the Pepsi liquid if I didn't know what was the in the in the in the bottles I would certainly make the right choice if they told me what which one is the back seat oh my god it's it's just it's just clear to me this one has to be the Pepsi you can really feel the sweetness of pepsi in it so guys this was a review for the red energy in blue color I think you must try this ones because they are really perfect ok I thank you all for seeing my reviews god bless you and I see you next time", "boWCwsdeKCk": "guys it's a reunion we are back with we've also done it before Winfield blue but it's actually a taste flow filter it's exciting exciting times so I actually don't get the logic behind it got inverted filter yes which they're they're quite new I mean I assume that um a lot of brands have been been innovating and in the ways that they still can with plain packaging and I guess this is one of the ways so we'll show the pack we don't have them on art they every pack doesn't have them that are only a few do I've only noticed Winfield and I think maybe JPS not too sure on that though then straight off the bat like I don't have much of a problem with the fact that it's inverted no it it's pretty much a whole new cigarette it's not like the old Winfield it is it talked to me for some reason it's a bit smoother even though you'd think you know wouldn't that stop got a more more stuff coming through more chemicals but I don't know it's a bit smoother as you can see the rim the actual rim is still fairly thick so I'm still still something all right so let's start off with the burn we got the toe and so it says original blue plus taste flow filter so yeah they love to get creative with the names these days yeah so burn we've had a couple droves it seems to be burning at a reasonable pace it's not too fast yeah it's it's faster than what we had the last review the Peter Jackson wood yeah it must be a minute in or something now and yeah we're about a third the code for this one is VP 102 if anyone's interested if drivers or if you're new to the channel if you're not from Australia and don't smoke the cigarettes actually have a code on them now they don't have the brand name you probably can't see that's a bit blurry yeah each each brand of cigarette has their own little code to stop advertising any way possible pretty much yep alright next quality will see the smoke what do we got in terms of smoke to be honest I'm it's it's a decent amount also slightly more than the Peter Jackson blues that we had the other day but approximately the same again for tailor-made you're never gonna get that many situations where there's a ton of smoke except for possibly a Marlboro ready and there may be Camel original or something but um it's for a tailor-made this is definitely decent I'm happy with it so yeah I'll agree with it it is actually burning a lot fire stuff yeah I out of turn I'd have to give it a I'll give it a seven all right on smoke I'll give it a seven and a half year and I'm burn it is burning pretty fast true we haven't rated that so yeah actually seeing that it's been almost two minutes only and it's two-thirds of the way down fairly average maybe slightly fast so I'm gonna give it a five and a half yeah I'm gonna give it a five it's a taste taste it's got the taste flow filter so yeah exactly so the taste really is flowing in this bad boy it's evident no honestly the taste isn't bad at all I'd give it a seven run off it's still got the chemical taste like every cigarette will and it still tastes like a Winnie Bloo definitely honestly like there isn't that much difference between a winning blue I find it is a little bit different summer he's not fighting money when he blows a little tiny bit in more harsh oh yeah taste is it yeah a little bit different but each to their own yeah on taste I'll probably give it a 6 not too bad but I always prefer Roley so it's always biased in that regard six out of ten yeah I'll give it I'll give it a six and a half out of ten harshness yep like I said the taste plug filter does for me it does make it a little bit more smoother oh no what about you yeah it's slightly smoother but it still has enough body to make it arch enough like yeah it's not like breathing air like some of those lighter cigarettes so yeah it's got a good body without being too harsh without irritating so in that regard definitely no problem I'm gonna give it a seven in the half yeah taste I'm gonna have to give it it I'll give it a seven seven out of ten that's so I say the bottom yeah it's not much it's not my probably not in my top 5 favorites but yeah that's not going either neither almost at the end now so overall overall I'm gonna give it a six and a half out of ten not bad overall I'm gonna give it a 6 and a half as well it's good wouldn't mind smoking one but it's not one that I would buy as a regular back for sure or not but that's just my taste so that's another review done movie oh oh you guys have a quick look at the scenery that we have right here it's actually quite another it's it's about rain know if you guys can see that we've done a few reviews here but yeah all right guys we'll leave it at that see low rate comment

this one out it's pretty sweet all right I'll see you guys real soon with a brand new video", "gqGxit_NiQ4": "what's up guys be green 91 and today we're checking out one of the first legal vaporizer cartridges in the Canadian recreational cannabis market we got this from City cannabis Cove in Vancouver they're legal recreational dispensary this vapour cartridge cost about $80 $70 and about $10 and taxes but after January 1st taxes on vaporizer products are going up to 20% these are new products and they were just introduced but the price point on them right now is just not making any sense this is a point three gram cartridge it cost $80 I could get a full spectrum extract saw scar on the black market for 25 bucks these are brand new they were just released as a part of the next wave of legalization known as legalization 2.0 the introduction of extracts and edibles these are the first offerings they came out around Christmas box has a strained name on their says one 510 indica cartridge net weight point three zero gravel THC is seven hundred and thirty three point eight milligrams so seventy three point 38 percent THC point seven milligrams CVD got the government required warning label on there says frequent and prolonged use of cannabis containing THC can contribute to mental health problems over time daily or near daily use increases the risk of dependence and may bring on or worsen disorders related to anxiety and depression back it says cannabis extract intended for inhalation contact information do not freeze or in a dry place or stored to keep upright no expiry date has been determined key vote of reach of children contains the equivalent of 1.2 grams of dried cannabis and has a packaging date on your tenth month of 2019 on the 21st day as you can see four point three cartridge it comes in quite a big package childproof to open it you're gonna break the tax stamp on the side you're gonna open the top flap of the box you're gonna press the two buttons in on the side pull it oh and there's your cartridge right out of the box it's a small cartridge 0.3 car it's got stickers on it this isn't a custom car it looks like a cheap car nazi so no particular brand i can see these being mimicked on the black market nothing to indicate that this actually came from a licensed producer lastik mouthpiece cut a glass body which is good ceramic coils 510 threading so it will fit on most standard vaporizer batteries the oil looks pretty clear which is good kind of hard to [ __ ] up cannabis oil about the oil is nice and clear golden which is a good sign seen some darker oils on the website but a smooth vapor very bland taste there's a bit of flavor but it's very bland time to get the hint of Kush smooth on the throw pretty underwhelming but I buy these for my personal use no I absolutely prefer my full-spectrum extract cards from the black market over these and really no comparison $80 for 0.3 gram cartridge $25 for 0.5 full-spectrum soft card for these legal products and dispensaries were brought in to try to eliminate the black market prices like $80 per point 3 gram cartridge I don't think that's gonna work to eliminate the black market I don't know if the recreational market will ever be able to catch up to the black market with prices and products like these the products are 100% inferior to what's available on the black market prior to legalization a product like this would cost you about 35 the pros of this product its legal the oil tastes clean it's a co2 oil so there's no additives or dilute and it's not a ceramic coil blast body which is good oils nice and clear and golden pecans it's expensive I'll go through one of these bow every 2 or 3 days I would never be able to afford to use these it's a cheap generic car super easy to mimic they only have stickers on there nobody wouldn't be able to tell the difference between this and a cart from the black market it's a point three milligram very small I didn't see any one gram cartridges available yet only 1/2 milligrams of 0.3 milligram the only way I would be able to recommend this product to somebody is if they absolutely refuse to purchase off the black mark like an old granny or something like that if they were looking for a vaporizer pen die I could recommend this product to them it's not great but it's not horrible it's not dirty it's actually probably the best product I have tried on the legal market I've tried the pre-rolls I've tried some of the buds and they were horrible this product is actually tolerable I was to give it a rating out of 10 I would give it a 4.5 absolutely underwhelming it's not amazing by any means better than I expected me personally I'll be sticking to what I know but for you guys I'll be continuing to do some reviews on legal cannabis products so stay tuned like share subscribe my name's be green thanks for watching peace", "YSjmQy42BWk": "[Music] what's up youtube this is shabazz and i'm back with another cbd hemp flower review what's up tomorrow can of sewers welcome back to another shabazz short today i'm reviewing something that i know a lot of y'all are going to be excited about it's another delta 8 product and specifically delta 8 vape cartridges by effects delta 8. now effects offers granddaddy perp strawberry cough and cali orange kush or calio they have one gram cartridges and guess what i have one of each cartridge so i'm gonna try each one let you know the flavor profile and by the end of taste testing all of them the effects should be kicking right in i do have a couple concerns right off the bat in the package i didn't get any paper test results and most importantly i didn't get a notice to law enforcement now when you're dealing with cannabis product and even especially with delta eight products because there's such a thin line between legality with delta eight there's such a thin line of legality with delta eight i feel like anything like this needs to have a letter to law enforcement what i did get in the package though is this absolutely massive effects sticker so here is the cartridges themselves one gram each says effects delta eight savage brand you got the granddaddy perp the cali oh and the strawberry cough they do have percentages on them so granddaddy perp has 82 percent d8 the cali o has 48 and the strawberry cough has 65.5 percent so let's start with uh the lightest and going up to the heaviest which works out for me too because of those terpenes so here goes the cali orange really nice packaging by the way i really like the packaging this packaging it's you know this is premium looking packaging it looks professional here we go pull the cartridge out the rubber caps on each no branding on this cartridge i don't know what brand it is i don't know where it comes from there has been a big issue in cannabis community lately with people using off-brand cheap carts that have lead and other things in them i don't know about this but it's always a plus when you're using good trusted name brand cartridges like c cell anyways so this is the calio i'm gonna get the screw right on here remember these carts fit on any 510 battery so any little battery like this if you're a stoner if you're in the cannabis life i'm sure you have a couple of these laying around [Music] i really like the terpenes on that really has that citrusy orange wow this is really citrusy and really orangey yeah 48 percent we'll take a couple hits of each one really smooth i mean it's a vapor it's it's it's it's a smooth i mean it's the smoothest vapor gas [Music] cali oh all right i like that one that was really cool and right here on the top i didn't even notice it says hybrid so this is going to be your hybrid smoke and i guess the hybrid terpene i probably should have started off with the sativa which i think is going to be the strawberry cough but that was cool now here goes the strawberry cough sativa terpene profile 65 d8 same packaging once again no really nice premium packaging okay now this one is a different cartridges this is one of the clear top cartridges i've had these before from a different vendor all right got that strawberry cough on there it tastes like strawberries [Music] very smooth the great thing about things they are super convenient they leave no smell you don't have to burn anything smoke anything pack anything clear anything out carry around a lighter go somewhere because the smell no vaporizers you could literally if you're at work you can literally go in the bathroom hit your vaporizer and walk back out no lingering smell nothing nobody will ever know so if you enjoy cannabis whether that be hemp or high thc flour and you are in the interest of being discreet definitely check out vape carts i think this is a good time to to warn everybody about delta eight delta h is very potent generally it doesn't come with the anxiety and the rush and the racy heartbeat and everything that delta nine thc does but that is only if you use it within reason do not overindulge on delta a because delta 8 is still thc and it will mess you up if you are thc sensitive and you cannot handle a thc high don't go crazy on the delta a it is far better than delta 9 far less anxiety but still it can get you there i got overzealous one day i was doing tiny little droplets of delta 8 distillate you know every 30 40 minutes and i was like uh you know this is nothing so i took a bowl of hemp flour squeezed a big old glob of d8 on there smoked the whole thing 10 minutes later i felt like i was dying if you've ever had cannabis induced panic attack you know what that feeling is you feel like you're gonna have a heart attack you can't stop breathing fast because if you breathe normal you just feel like you're not breathing enough racy thoughts you're worried you're paranoid that whole terrible thing that happened to me granted i did take a huge amount a very potent delta ate this to it but still don't go crazy with the delta eight take baby steps and just be cautious with it delta eight can be a very great time but if you overdo it it can also be a bad time all right let's move on over to the grand daddy perp which is the indica coming at 82 i'm gonna take a little bit more light on this one because i definitely feel the effects coming out from the other two same packaging this cart is actually branded so interestingly each cart for each different flavor is slightly different i actually like that because it's easy to tell them apart all right here goes the granddaddy perp and i'm gonna go easy on this because i'm already feeling crazy oh that's extremely creepy i think they might have overdid it with the terpenes on the granddaddy purp that tastes like purple kool-aid straight up it's good it's smooth but i'm gonna have to end that there all right vape cartridges d8 it's convenient no smell no odor no smoke i mean with this product i'm gonna definitely give it the shabazzle of approval good vape good terpenes my only concerns is no letter to law enforcement and they didn't appear to be name brand cartridges so i noticed while editing this video i got so faded i didn't even talk about the effects i don't know if you could notice if you go back and rewind my eyes got super duper red this is what i mean delta 8 is super strong a tiny bit goes a long way and it is extremely easy to overdo it needless to say the effects on these cartridges are very good they're very potent they're so good that i think i need to warn everybody that just because it's delta eight if you are prone to paranoia or anxiety intrusive thoughts you've got to take it easy but yes effects are very strong the terpenes definitely do make a difference whether it's a sativa hybrid or indica feeling afterwards a couple puffs go a long way so don't overdo it but within reason with the delta eight yeah i actually really like that that's a much more convenient way of getting the delta eight rather than smoking or dabbing distillate anyway so y'all that's the review make sure you go down in the description check out the merch hit me up on ig here here i appreciate everybody watching my videos if

ugly number 4 this one is Sour Diesel this one oh [ __ ] I can't remember what it was it was something else originally smoked at all pop the cap off refilled it with a blueberry old gene from - bacon so the last thing in here was blueberry OG and all I did was I went to a shop in California oh my god this thing is by THC clear this one is a Private Reserve so it's 30 dollars a gram to distillate this is true OG I got a couple other ones and all I do is pop this thing off is unscrewed and then all you do is pop this thing off without squirting it all over the place all right hopefully doesn't look down on me so all I do from here is I slowly squirt this [ __ ] in and you don't really know how hard it is to do until you film and try and do it but hopefully fill in the camera you just got a drip this [ __ ] slow in here not down this tube but down the side of it up the tube is where your vapor goes on these brass knuckles so you don't want to fill that thing up with oil because then you'll just suck a whole bunch over the lots on V plural that is alright so syringe empty true OG and then now I got a field brass knuckle and just stick this thing right back on [Music] you just got to make sure that when you're twisting it that it's everything's flushed sometimes you'll get it fresh out of the container and it's not really flush and some of the liquid will act not like it some of your you know your concentrate will leak out I've gotten a couple with this [ __ ] not really centered and some liquid has escaped not a whole bunch to [ __ ] about but enough to get the concerned about alright so I just filled this bastard up now let's see if she works I mean I know sure were three point seven two point seven max 3.7 if you're going bolts you know for the lowest and then for your highest on Watts it's e if I'm not mistaken it's on the Box use a Chico so I got this [ __ ] at this I usually take about three three four to five second hint and she weeks", "6-pTCOT87Os": "what's happening YouTube it's jaylee thank somebody for to Nana once again guys I got two new flavors to bring you tonight for review this is gonna be off two flavors that asketh Valley just picked up within the last month or so they've been picking up all types of different e-liquids guys so you definitely want to make sure you go over and check them out we're gonna be bringing you tonight the classic cherry slush and the classic blue razz so let's not waste any more time you guys already know the routine let's go ahead and dive into it [Music] [Applause] [Music] so yeah alright guys so both of these flavors worse than ever to me from Andy at Aspen Valley vapes for purpose of review that of course will not change my thoughts or opinions on either of these two liquids so we got the blue rad so for all you blue raspberry slushy lovers like myself stay tuned for this one you may find another one that you'll enjoy for those of you out there like myself who have been in the market for a good sherry ever since you started vaping and have a family one yet stay tuned for the review maybe we'll finally find a decent cherry I don't know about you guys but when it comes to cherry flavors they are most of the time of mists are one of the hardest flavors in my honest opinion to get the unpacked for some reason cherry flavors either come out too artificial to strong taste some like cough medicine called drops frankly they just taste pretty shitty in my opinion so I was really excited but at the same time skeptical about the cherry now when it comes to slush flavors I like vaping out of a tank but considering it specifies on the bottle best for best flavor enjoying a dripper we're gonna go ahead and have a bit out of my favorite RDA the dead rabbit so we're gonna start off with the cherry first now both of these are 60 ml bottles 1899 I'll give you guys 25% off coupon code at the end of the review underneath the description so you can get 25% off of this or any of the other flavors Aspen Valley has to offer and guys they've been bringing in boatloads of new flavors so make sure you go over get on their newsfeed and check out all the flavors they have and it comes in a zero three or a six milligram that can't email I did of course get mine in a three and they also have a watermelon and they have a lime as well which will be bringing you those reviews later on next week all right so let's not waste any more time let's get down to it so here's the bottle right here for the cherry and again we'll start off on this one both of these flavors I literally have not vape Don yet except the cherry I soaked up the cotton but I only took one vapor right before the intro so I haven't had time to really take in the flavor all right so here we go right here so it is a chubby authentic gorilla bottle by the way it's got the cherry on the front says classic slush there it's got 60 ml 3 milligram on the front gives you all the warnings all the ingredients in there on the bottom that's where it says best enjoyed in a in a dripper alright so guys bear with me once again for those of you who've been subscribed to my channel for a while I know you can tell I haven't been doing my reviews from the normal location I'm working my way back there but as of right now I just kind of got to do my reviews for you know in different spots whenever I get a chance so I can keep keep you guys satisfied key humph an amount all right so again gives you all the warnings all that good stuff on the back so it's manufactured by vml out of Branford Connecticut so we're gonna open it up smell let you know what to get from the smell then we're gonna vape on I'm gonna go over to vapor production throat hit flavor on both the in how the exhale I'll let you guys know it's an all-day V for me if of course I recommend it to you why I wonder why I would not go out and buy this and we'll grade each category a being the best FB Norris alright so let's go and take a smell it smells good it smell it smells like it smells like the cherry juice that you would put in a slushie it honestly does so smell I'll go ahead and get the smell a B+ I definitely like the smell doesn't smell like cough syrup doesn't smell like golf drops now on the Aspen value website somebody did do a written review and said that it tastes like a bad cough medicine I'm gonna be honest with you guys if it takes like Kauffman ascent I will tell you I'm not gonna [ __ ] you guys alright so we're already got dripped and ready to go here on a dead rabbit we got a pair of twisted fuse Clapton's 100 watts 0.15 ohms let's go I never babe by the way guys this is a max VG alright so maybe that's why they're recommending best in a dripper so it is a max VG I don't think I touched on that so vapor production as you can see nice and dense they're milky they're lingering around so we're gonna give the vapor reduction in a it's pumping out the vapor guys it's filling up the room so yeah it's definitely putting out plenty of clouds in my opinion throat hit on a scale of minimal to hard very smooth no throat hey easy on the inhale easy on the exhale and even out the nostrils is very pleasant if you guys hear a little barking or a little scratching don't mind that's just a big-ass Rottweiler that's uh decided he's gonna come in and watch me do the review so don't mind him that's just Gus he don't mean any harm all right so we're gonna drip a little bit more in here and then we're gonna start talking about the flavor I'll tell you now I I don't get coffee medicine I don't get a nasty cough drop taste now that is subjective every one is different just because somebody else was tasting that doesn't mean everybody is but so far I'm not getting the nasty artificial uh or just that really nasty strong coffee ah poor COFF medicine thank God because that cherry cough medicine that a lot of cherry vapes have just absolutely are just horrible they're horrendous so what I'm gonna say honestly guys I get more or less like a uh I don't really get so much with cherry cherry slushy I get yeah it's not so much like a like a slushy I get more of like a mild cherry Jolly Rancher that's pretty much what I'm getting from this so if you're like me I love cherry Jolly Ranchers one of my favorite ones and it pretty much tastes like that only dad it tastes a little a little toned down a notch so not as sweet doesn't really have that that tartness to it it's not bad at all I mean I honestly did not really have too high hopes for it even though I was excited I was very skeptical because again that's a cherry eliquid let's go do a couple more but yeah I definitely don't get that nasty cough medicine taste what I'm gonna do at the end of the review I'm gonna actually go ahead and mix a little bit of the blue wrath and the cherry together we're just gonna drip a little bit at the same time and I'm gonna see how that tastes because I'm really interested to know how it would be if you combine the two because these look like they'd be good and mixing liquids all right so uh it's it's decent could i vape could I bake this all day now guys remember this these are just opinions all right as of right now I can vape this all day I honestly can't it's not very sweet at all um I would like it to be a little sweeter I honestly would I would like if it's gonna taste like a UH if it's gonna taste like a like a cherry slushie I definitely would like it to be a little bit sweeter but I'm definitely not getting a slushy aspect at all I'm getting more or less like I said like a like a comp like a Jolly Rancher only without that tartness and without without that uh without all the sweet sweetness of it and without all the sugar it's it's like a mild Jolly Rancher that's exact area Jolly Rancher is the best way I can explain this e-liquid again my opinion let me go into another not bad at all I mean it's definitely uh it's not you know I'm not I'm not taken back by it it's not D I'm not gonna say it's the it's the best cherry flavor in the world I'm still waiting to find one of those I'm still hoping that I find a really good sherry please if you guys have any recommendations on a good cherry e-liquid let me know down below I will absolutely purchase it and give you guys a review on it because I've been really wanting good cherry liquid for a long time not bad though guys I can vape it all day like I said it's very smooth so would I recommend this to you if you guys if you guys were into like the cherry Jolly Ranchers and you're not you're not looking for something that's too sweet and if you're not really uh you know if you're looking for a cherry slushy flavor then no I wouldn't recommend it because in my opinion I don't get that from it but if you if you're looking for a decent cherry flavor that if you don't have any in the rotation and even then search for one I think I would give it a shot I think you guys may enjoy it and you may get the same flavor as I'm getting out of it all right other than that I'm gonna have to go ahead and give the grade on this a b-minus um you know what I'm gonna have to give it a C+ even though it's an all day vape I'm not getting the cherry slushie Flay at all from it I'm more or less get like a like I said just like a mild cherry Jolly Rancher so I'm not taking back at all but I could probably vape this all day I don't see why I couldn't because it's not over family sweet at all but it's definitely not gonna be one that I'm gonna be reaching for on the Shelf constantly that's for sure alright so guys without further ado we're gonna go ahead and move on to the blue slush and I'm gonna let you know my thoughts and opinions on that one all right guys here we are with the slush classic berry I keep wanting to say blue razzmatazz actually labeled berry but no difference with anything guys only difference actually is the flavor profile and the label so here you go you got the blue raspberries all over it there alright and same thing guys this I've yet to really vape on this so except when we came back on that first vape was the first time I even tried this you're gonna get my initial thoughts and opinions right here during this review just like I did with the cherry we're gonna open it up smell let you know what I get from the smell vape on it go over to flavor well first of all go to vapor production throat hit flavor on me and how the exhale I'll let you guys know if then all day vape for me if of course I recommend it to you why I wonder why I would not go out and buy this and we'll grade each category a B and the best F being worse and then we'll wrap it up so let's open it up and again I'm a big fan of blue razz flavor so a lot of times when I have certain blue raspberry flavors I don't think they're all that great because I've had so many that I've really enjoyed and pretty soon I'm gonna let you guys know what my top blue razz play Brizard during a separate review so here we go yeah I'm not digging that at all the I enjoyed the smell from the cherry way more than I'm enjoying it from the blue raspberry and I did shake it up real good it's a I don't know I get that I get the berry I get the blue raspberry whatever the hell you want to call it but um it's not reminding me of a slushie whatsoever and it's just it's not really all that great honestly like you get the berry flavor do you get the berry smell but it's just not you know it's it's not really doing it for me at all so I'm gonna give the smell on this one honestly I'm gonna have to give it a day I'm just not feeling that whatsoever maybe when we vape on it it'll be a lot better sometimes you know things aren't always what they seem you can have something that does not smell good but tastes fantastic so we'll see in a moment but so far I'm just not enjoying that smell whatsoever to Cherry was way better in my opinion where are you gonna trip them ready to go here on the dead rabbit all I did was throw some new cotton in there I'm using from the cotton candy collection if you guys want to check the review out I did on that awesome cotton hardly any breaking time so you guys can go ahead and check that out I'll put that link down below as well alright so here we go 95 watts well we're gonna turn that up actually let's go back to 105 like you did with the cherry alright same build fresh cotton let's have a baby [Applause] alright so vapor production no different from the cherry definitely gets in a nice dense milky clouds throat hit on a scale of minimal to hard I actually get a slight throat hit from the blue res or from the berry I do get a little bit more of a throat hit than I got from the cherry definitely nothing I couldn't handle it's not strong whatsoever so I still think it's a very it's a mild throat hit guys but um the big question is the flavor I'm just not really feeling this one to be honestly yeah it's again taste is always subjective you may like it more than me but I've had I've had a lot better blue rosin and slushie flavors are in blue and very slushy flavors when it comes to that matter it's just not really uh it's just I had high hopes for this one I did because I really thought it was gonna be a good one but it's just not doing it for me guys and I'm only gonna be honest with you like I said everybody's different taste is always subjective but I'm just not a huge fan on this one you get to bury from it you definitely get that berry it still does not remind me of a slushie but if it tastes more like it like the cherry taste it to me like a mild cherry Jolly Rancher if this tastes it like a mild blue raspberry Jolly Rancher I'd be completely content with it but it just has like a like a berry flavor really no slush and it has a very it has an odd aftertaste I don't want to say like a chemically aftertaste or a perfumey aftertaste but it just has an answer taste and I'm just I'm not really agreeing with it all so guys I got it like I said I gotta give the I'm gonna have to get the flavor on this one addi I could invade this all day it's not something that I would go out and buy again in my opinion now the cherry on the other hand am i surprisingly the cherry was are more better than the bluegrass in my opinion all right you guys may enjoy it so what I recommend it to you if you know what no I wouldn't because if I'm if I'm really not enjoying it then I I honestly couldn't recommend it but that does not mean that you may not like it if you guys tried this let me know down below what your thoughts and opinions were okay we're not always gonna agree on the same things this is just one that uh that I'm just not really feeling guys but maybe it's just me again

cocktail first yes [Music] so for this cocktail you're going to need midori sonja a little pineapple juice and a little shaky shaky shake shake shake all right um and then the secret ingredient which is not going to be a secret after this but put some regular ice in your gorgeous martini shaker from gary's and you want to add three ounces of midori this is one ounce per one look at that it looks like a antifreeze that's how much i am coloring outside the lines my first encounters and then we're gonna do equal parts pineapple juice which i'm just gonna one two three that worked shake shake shake shake shake there we go see my skull oh [Applause] so as you can see so right now you got your swampy haunted house new orleans thing this is dry ice [Music] ready do you see that come on jason

like crazy in love beyonce and jay-z bishway bishway oh my god that's really good it's a sweet drink it's good the only thing quite frankly that i would do is i usually don't put sugary stuff in my drinks i would put probably like a little vodka up in this you know what i'm saying two shots of vodka i'm really proud of my concoction well i'm gonna give this one five skulls for sure because it's halloween and i'm feeling festive you can't get better than this i don't there's no boiler room in the other cocktails so five skulls now round two [Music] now we're gonna do a little apple cider white sugar brown sugar rim a little caramel pumpkin butter a little bourbon yeah i know your mouth just watered dip your glass first in your apple cider then this is brown and white sugar just combined together i used like light brown sugar which i usually would like to use dark because then the rim comes out darker okay so but it still looks festive right now you break out the good stuff this is what my grandfather would like so you take your little bourbon and i want to actually mix this up in one of my glasses so we'll do that three ounces of bourbon if you are my kind of people but if you're like a light drinker you just kind of like want to sip on one all night maybe just you can make it it's really two ounces of bourbon and then you want to do two scoops caramel pumpkin butter from william sonoma teaspoons tablespoons it's in between it's not a real measure i'm gonna do a couple shakes of bitters mix it up because you want the butter to obviously blend in and basically you don't even have to strain this right because you need ice in the drink anyway now i like a lot of ice in my drinks so i fill it all the way up you garnish it with a few apple slices look at that and because it's halloween put a little spider in there [Music] nothing says the fall like apple cider and bourbon wow it's actually really good i would say it's a four out of four skulls out of five but

here so today we're doing another disposable like we've done with the Android I'm gonna try to make videos like that where I'm grabbing different disposables and seeing how they work as a former smoker or I know as probably many of you guys know exactly where that line is you know compared to something like this to something that you want a little similar a little mouth to toe long device what would be a good transition first and then yeah I mean then you can go go ham on whatever but this one is the blue vivid vanilla this is a two point four one milliliter cartridge I guess tank cartridge that's what they used to have is those little cartridges you screwed in yeah so we're gonna go down below and we will open her up come back up tap and vape on it or puff on it but it has 400 puffs that's another thing 400 puffs the Android had 300 puffs so they were saying 400 is roughly about a pack and a half to two packs somewhere right around there so we'll go down below and we'll be back guys okay hang on alright guys so here we are we're gonna just kind of give her opening up yes basically what I thought now I used to not get these but whenever they had the blue like the starter packs I used to buy those years ago so this is before the disposables that I can remember at that blue made I got here just pretty much like an instruction sheet ah something and here we go so I'll redeem this coat huh it looks just like the ones that used to buy normal it came in like a pack and you can plug them in or screw into the pack and they would charge you know I could already smell the vanilla coming off this oh there we go still got the blue tip that's kind of cool now here's where the cartridge used to be you used to be able to unscrew this and here was your cartridges you'd use to buy your cartridges screw them on in and then this is your actual battery now it's probably the same this place though the cartridge is play I mean obviously this is the battery so um that's about it man this one was gonna be pretty quick you got here well air hole looks like it's all they did was just pretty much take a disposable now what I do not like about this compared to like the end Roy was this is hard and I actually talked about this in the enjoy I said remember those blues and all this I said they they had a hard like cartridge where the end Roy was a squishy you've like foam type where this obviously is not so alright we'll go back up top we'll give it a couple hufflepuff some Hufflepuff couple of puffs and that'll be about it this one's gonna be pretty short of video all right guys Han all right so we're back up here if you said one complaint I already have is the filter I think they could have done better so especially for 10bux where the other one was I think seven I mean it does give you an extra 100 puffs approximately they say so let's give it a go and they didn't really but I mean improve pretty much anything from the from the old ones I guess a little bit I mean there's a little bit more of a vapor it comes out of here plus there's about five holes where the old ones used to have one uh-huh I don't like it I don't like it mm-hmm ah there's I mean I could smell the vanilla but it tastes like it tastes like tobacco I don't know maybe I'm just spoiled with the young with my custards my vanilla custards but I'm I'm not a big fan god damn it I'd rather buy the Android I mean if you want to buy something like this I mean try it I guess for some of you that's on cigarettes can buy something like this if they want something similar to what their taste is but to me it it tastes like it tastes like donkey dick Oh needs some kind of real [ __ ] vanilla in air still going a weak strong weak on that same bill so other than this ship what do we got coming on we got the famous we're gonna put the stainless steel mesh in here so we'll do a little temperature controlled I guess vape we're gonna try the temperature controlled so all on that I mean that's it this is to me this is garbage this is crap for ten bucks I would rather buy the by the Android and there's there's multiple different ones out there so I am gonna try the different ones but this to me [Applause] you think for how long they've been around Adam I don't like it broken iam teeth on the frickin filter still they could have done better they could have done a lot better well that's it all right peace [Music]", "Lf2ppDdXTbM": "hey everybody and welcome back to my quitting smoking by turning to vaping story and in my last video I talked about picking up on the Joule and I was gonna try try out the jewel to see if I could use that to help me quit smoking and satisfy any cravings I would ever have when I needed to or felt the urge to you know have a cigarette and I'm gonna tell you now why I don't like the Joule and I've switched to another product that I like a lot better but a couple reasons why I don't like the Joule very first thing was a mr. kit that I bought that had all these flavors in it I mean there's a mint there's a mango there's a creme brulee and there's a Virginia tobacco which doesn't even taste like tobacco it tastes more like as I said in the last video it tastes more like Cologne so both starter pack all the flavors they throw at me I'm not interested in you know that that's I'm trying to wean off of cigarettes I'm not trying to to start vaping you know even though that's kind of what I'm doing I'm not doing this so I can have a long career in baking you know or vape for the rest of my life I'm doing it to help curb any cigarette cravings that I have and when I was smoking cigarettes I was smoking tobacco you know I was smoking Reds and lights but when I smoked it tasted like tobacco it didn't taste like creme brulee it didn't taste like mint or didn't taste like strawberry you know I didn't smoke swisher Sweets you know when I was when I was smoking so I have no interest in all of these flavors and you know I know now that jewel has a few tobacco options but my personal experience with the jewel as has pretty much confirmed that I'm not going to ever buy a jewel product again and of course that's one thing is you know the flavors another thing was the fact that they don't offer a 0% nicotine jewel basically makes it pretty clear in their in their marketing and advertising and the products that they offer there you know they want you off a cigarette sure but they want you to be hooked on their product forever you know so they don't offer anything that has no nicotine in it everything they offer is you know 5% or whatever the lower grade is for them 3.6 or whatever but they add I mean they want you to be addicted this and so you stay stuck on their product so that in itself I mean that that's not what I'm out for like I said I'm not trying to you know vape for the rest of my life I'm just trying to curb cigarette cravings for however long it takes being you know a few weeks few months few years you know except quit smoking for well over a year before and still ended up coming back to smoking so I'm always gonna need something I can kind of lean on you know to help me when I have a cigarette craving so the flavors were one thing the fact that they don't offer 0% nicotine is another thing and another thing that I don't like about the Joule is out of the you know two out of the four pods that have you know I got with the starter pack have already failed the the first pod to go was the Virginia tobacco and it just quit hitting all together you know I've tried playing with the little things on the bottom and trying to adjust them and just it just it just won't hit so the things sitting there fooling it doesn't work and this right here is the the cream flavor and the cream was my favorite flavor in there but the problem with it is that I hit it but it has no flavor you know this pot is almost completely full still and it's already lost its flavor so and I definitely don't like the mango I hate the mint it almost makes me gag when I try to try to inhale that one so you know I've had product defects to go along with the other reasons why I don't like the jewel so this jewel I keep it for backup but as far as I'm concerned I'm done with it the product that I went to and there's something I need to tell you about this product afterwards so I mean I'm gonna reveal it to you but don't click away right away because there's something that you need to know about this product if you plan on trying it the product is blue my blue they might have you spend called and that's one of their trade names my blue but the blue I really like this product a lot it hits really good and it's got a really good flavor to it the flavor that came with it I got the starter pack comes with the device itself and it comes with you know your pod but starter kit was a gold leaf is what it came with and that's a 2.4 percent nicotine so it's lower than you know the jewel and so I like the flavor that comes with it I also like the fact that when I got online I saw three other tobacco flavors you know they also have a classic tobacco they have a Carolina tobacco and some other flavor I can't really remember off the top my head but they have products that cater to what I'm looking for which is the flavor of tobacco so that way I really feel like you know I'm putting it to my mouth I'm hitting something to taste like tobacco blow and smoke out so that's that's that's really what I needed and the jewel didn't fit that bill in any way shape or form whatsoever this right here though I think it's gonna work out pretty good now there's a problem with the blue devices if you go to their website they um they they put all their ratings on there you know all the all the reviews that customers is left so I mean there's five star four star there's plenty of one-star reviews too and one of the most common complaints about the the blue device was the pods and they say that the pods leak so you know even though that made me a little not so sure if I wanted to try it because a lot of people complained about pods leakage I went ahead and I am I'm gonna shut my window because my neighborhood just came outside okay now we're back I went ahead and decided I was gonna try it anyway and when I first opened up the box of course it comes with everything that you need you know it came with a came with the cord to charge it came with the device itself and came with the pod so you have everything you need to get started but when I went to open the package for the pod the I noticed that there was some liquid inside the package that was outside of the pod so I bought one that had a pod that was leaking however I've been able to overlook that it's not been that terrible to have a leaking pod maybe I just doesn't leak as bad as what some people have complained about but you probably cannot see it on this video but there's actual a little bit of liquid already on the outside of this this pod right here which I've almost finished off because it tastes just really good but that's a big big issue for some people I'm sure to me like I said I've kind of gotten over it it's not it's not that bad give you a really strong good hit stuff so I like them I believe a lot and I've already ordered some more pods here's something else I want to point out so Jules basically I think they break down to five bucks a pod you know four pack for twenty dollars these right here the the my blue pods they come in two packs for ten dollars so it's basically the same price per pod but something that you don't need to overlook is that you're getting twice the amount here's a jewel pod that will jewel pod has a point 7 milliliters I think in it and then there's this monster pod right here for the blue and it is 1.5 milliliters so it is over twice the size of the module or module of the jewel and it's the same price per pod so you're actually getting twice the amount for the same price so that's another one up that the blue has over over the jewel and another thing that blue offers which I really like they don't offer just you know just the blue stick if that's what you want to call it they also offer disposables that will look like cigarettes I'm gonna open this up for the first time actually I bought it yesterday because this pod was getting low and I didn't want to run out before my replacements got here but um this right here is the disposable and they make not only the disposables that are shaped like cigarettes but also offer a product that shaped like cigarettes but um has tanks that you unscrew and screw in a new tank to replace it but this right here see so you would hold this just like cigarette when you're taking hits off of it which for somebody who is coming off of smoking really needs this is something that tastes like tobacco supposedly I'm about to try it for the first time but I supposedly taste like tobacco and you get to hold it like a cigarette so I don't I think that's all I had to do was just take that plastic piece off we're gonna see whether or not I did it right I did so there's a website blue comm product is blue and that's all right so it's pretty decent that is the Carolina bold 2% nicotine it's not as strong as the 2.4 percent that's hardly much of a difference but I can definitely taste the difference in that gold leaf versus the Carolina bulb this right here as a very tasteless an ultra-light that's that I could probably use something a little bit stronger than that but it's not bad and another thing I forgot to mention is the the gold leaf that's like the best-tasting I mean I haven't tried everything out there but that gold leaf tastes like it tastes like vanilla graham crackers vanilla wafers there's almost what it tastes like with of course a heavy hint of tobacco so that thing's delicious and that's probably why I've pretty much killed that pod after a week I'm sure a lot of people kill pods a lot faster than that but I don't use these all the time I just use it when I feel like I need it we've had to find out if I'm doing this wrong there's a little tiny hole in this and I wonder if I'm supposed to put my finger on that when I go to take a draw remove the blue cigarette take off the rubber cap take a draw from that end okay well maybe not that's all there is to it so let's try this again it's not too bad and like I said this one right here is just disposable but you can buy these for this part it's actually a tank so here's your device you would charge it and everything and then you just don't screw the tank when it's done and put a new tank on so that's a this right here is probably gonna be the product that I go with um probably use that as backup and this will probably be something that I'm gonna stay with because this is just like holding a cigarette I'm actually smoking so I like that a lot better so if you're in the market of quitting smoking not necessarily you know trying to become a like a heavy vapor but I mean if you're just trying to quit smoking jool might not be the way to go because they don't really cater to people that are trying to stop the habit altogether started trying to hook you on their products so like I said they everything they offer has nicotine they don't have anything that doesn't and blue does blue actually comes in I think it's as high as 5% but then it goes as low as 3.6% 2.4% and then even zero so they have a lot more options to help you wean off of the habit so yeah I like I like blue a lot better I like what they stand for that's definitely gonna be my product of choice now if you're trying to quit smoking I recommend that you try it as well you might find that you like it a lot better than any other option because it is the closest to mimicking smoking as you can get as far as I can tell that's real smooth almost too smooth I could use something a little harsher than that but nonetheless it's not bad so the blue the blue and the jewel ah let me hit this again I just can't believe that it has no flavor that's that's ridiculous that pot is almost completely full so maybe I got something defective you know just like you can get one of these that could possibly be defective - like I said remember you might like in one that's got leaking pods you might have to buy some new pods to replace um or whatever but yeah my blue is the way I'm gonna go for now and I'll update you guys in a couple weeks or more and let you know how it's going see if I still like the product or if I've found something better and in the meantime if you're trying to quit smoking and that's why you're watching this video I wish you all the luck in the world and I hope that you can kick the habit I believe I have because I've now I've not smoked since late February and it's early March now so I've done pretty good haven't had a cigarette in that entire time frame and with the help of this hopefully I will never touch a cigarette again so thank you very much guys for tuning in this is just a real quick video pretty short was really boring but at least you know about another product you can try alright thank you I'll see you guys next time", "0vBGk7cNq94": "hi guys under here from e-cigs UK UK thanks for joining us today where we bring you another review this time we'll be looking at a couple of a liquids by blue and these are the blue pro blueberry and strawberry mint the deal wide variety of flavors do blue and as you've probably seen in all the shops and on their website and so we chose blueberry and strawberry mint amongst a few other flavors just because we like them or we like the look of them anyway hopefully we'll like the taste so without further ado let's jump straight in and have a quick look at the bottles before filling a few tanks and giving them a bit test ok so this is how they arrive in the packaging right decent I have a blueberry 0.9% and a strawberry mint at 1.8% nicotine strengths nice bit spot varnishing on there and all the packaging for all their liquids and all the bottles for all the liquids are identical it's just literally the the colors associated with the the flavors they're different so you can see there's blood little colored splashes and things down the bottom and a bit of color off here so that said we'll put one aside and just look one of them as they're all the same saw the blueberry one first thing that struck me these are 10 mill balls by the way first thing that struck me is that they all come with a little instruction booklet because this is classed as blue pro e liquid for the blue pro VIP and that's Lou dip so inside you'll find a little instruction booklet on how to fill the blue pro which pretty much goes for any vaporizer to be fair I did have a blue pro we've reviewed on but it's used it's spent so and I haven't got an extra tank left for it and so I'll be using different their pens to to do the bit test but that's not really an issue so as e-liquid is compatible with pretty much everything so there we go so yeah usual safety features and things but it's nice to see that it comes with a little instruction booklet not just a box and not just a bottle so here's the bottle a bit closer conceal it laughter there we go so as a batch number here she's good it has a bit of a Braille triangle safety indent which is good bit of an ingredients list in she warned in hazards the usual stuff and the safety top which it actually says on here press it onto so we'll do that take this off it always falls off and I'm filling up nice nip I like the end there it's nice and narrow but long enough as well so you can avoid that nasty center part of your tanks when filling up down the side there we go so for this test I'm gonna be using the Apollo own go tank and the aspire Plato and we'll fill one up with the blueberry and one up with the strawberry mint we'll do a quick test so I filled these up earlier and as you can probably see there they are really easy squeezable bottles the nice and sturdy the well-built but they have a bit of flex to the center to the middle part so when you squeeze in you don't have to to break your finger and thumb whilst doing it so it is there are very easy to use bottles so we've got the apollo on goal here filled with this the blue pro strawberry mint this one so here goes let's give it a test see what we think plenty of vapor there it's quite a nice thick consistency liquid tests very nice very strawberry but I can't really test any minute there I was expecting it to be to have quite a mental punch as when something has mint in the title that's normally the conclusion I'd jump to and this doesn't in fact I can't really taste that even though I can taste a lot of strawberry it's it's very syrupy tasty it's very sweet strawberry but it I don't know it's got a bit of an alcohol e-type aftertaste I don't know whether last that the right term to use they're a bit like a strawberry liqueur type test which I very much like I was a bit hesitant about twists in this one with the menthol kick because sometimes that can be really overpowering yeah but for me there's no mint there so I suppose if you're looking for a strawberry mint and maybe this wouldn't be the right one and but if you're looking for a really nice strawberry syrupy tasting liquid then I think it works for that so yeah I'd be reefer that reflow rename in that strawberry syrup or something so that's very nice anyway so onto the blueberry which I've popped into the aspire weight or tank is there you can see the strawberry had like a golden almost like golden syrup style look to it and this has more of a it's got like an orangey looks a bit like I am brew to be fair or blueberry juice but anyway so got these sets of 13 watts fairly low powered and so yeah let's see what the blueberry tea is like so again plenty of vapor there and likewise plenty of flavor that does taste of blueberry it's good to know that does taste a bit tiny bit mentally just to give it a bit more of a kick there I think um but it's not the strongest flavor blue blueberry that I've tasted in an a liquid I have tasted stronger I've altered also tastes a lot weaker so it's it's still fairly decent that has more of a throught it than the the strawberry mint does as well so yeah you can you can taste a bit more of the PG there so it hits the back of your throat as you can probably tell but again still very nice so overall - very nice flavors there by blue I prefer the strawberry to the blueberry personally but like I said if you expecting a strawberry mint then I would probably look elsewhere to be fair so there you go thanks for watching and this has been under a 6 UK dog dot uk' please check back for more reviews coming from us or they're already up there obviously if you haven't already and thanks for watching see you later", "JHuSstnceBE": "do you have a cartridge and you're having a hard time refilling it I'm going to show you how to remove the mouthpiece from these cartridges in a way that they can then be reused or the oil can be recovered from them now the tools that I'm going to be utilizing are simply a common pair of vise grips and these are going to be csail one mil or one gram disposable one-time use ceramic coil cartridges let's take this to the deck okay well here we are once again these are one-time use non removable sea cells as you can see right here this is a sea sell brand we're going to take a pair of vice grips common rice clips and we're going to adjust them so when we apply them we apply them just at the base of that metal see how it's just barely barely at the base of that metal right there and we want to close it so it closed it just a little bit it pinches down just ever so slightly nothing cracks it barely bows and then you rock it back and forth rather firmly now there you have it you will get some flyer marks on the mouthpiece but if you look this caller right here which is what you want to preserve is undamaged completely undamaged okay now well there's the silicone ring right there that will seal around this shaft so you don't worry about that now in this outer sheath you can see that it is also undamaged all right I will show you again on this one here you take the pliers right at the base of the metal hinge it lock it back and forth pulling the cartridge off of the mouthpiece just like that [Applause] very simple easy there you have it", "kDmFFNVaJCU": "hey what is up

not really like in the spirits to make a video but I do want to make a video you know I want to have a video made for you guys tomorrow because I've been keeping it consistent so this is my attempt to making a video on a lazy day well even though it's been productive so into the introduction to the video topic today guys I'll be showing you guys my favorite baddie battery baddie for short [ __ ] and then we're gonna be show it we're gonna be going into higher def of the Alpine live resin cartridges we're gonna be hitting both the gorilla glue number 4 and the true OG it's just gonna be a chill sesh imma be telling you guys what I like about these products and why I choose the stick it was battery over other batteries because as you guys know I have had the opportunity to try so many batteries as of late and they've been great there's been a lot of great ones there's been a lot of bad ones so I want to tell you guys why I choose this one over the other ones that I've tried so far so since it is already gonna be night time I'm gonna go ahead and hit this with the indica first I shot my head with the hybrid first gorilla glue number four and then we're gonna go straight into the true orgy right after we're gonna had a piece of lint in my freaking mouth so right here guys you got the girl the glue number four not sure if that's focused in or not but gorilla glue number four and got the battery fully charged dude so go ahead and screw that on here and man it's kind of hot it's it's spring time already yeah like I think it officially hit spring and it's starting to get hot the worm is starting to kick in man and it's finally not cold which is cool you know even though I enjoyed the cold I definitely didn't enjoy the days that it was so so freezing to the point where I had to be covered in two blankets but if you guys are 18 you know where 21 over make sure you guys are hitting this along with me let me know what you guys are hitting in the comments below man it has been a long day my mind it's kind of like scattered right now like I said I didn't I wasn't going to make a video but here I am for you guys the dedication and consistency so whose battery my resident Alpine gorilla glue number four cheers boys ooh there's so amazing about Alpine vapora has to have by far the best gorilla glue number four in the world dude they nail it to the point to the point and for sure so when taking another hit and then I'm probably gonna [ __ ] do you know I'm probably gonna just turn the air on for a little bit oh sure I just cracked the window it is a beautiful little day-out pledge crack the window a little bit this one too and we're gonna take another hit and I'm gonna tell you guys why I like this battery more than any other battery that I've tried so far so I'm actually packing it closes because there's people playing music and I don't want their music to overlap mine so just gonna have to stick with the air on us can barely hear anyways man that is amazing right already starting to sweat man these summer days these spring and summer days are so amazing it's definitely one of my favorite seasons to smoke in by far I do not enjoy any other season than summer scene the smoking like just being able to enjoy smoking at any place like outside especially dude that was the biggest hurt of the winter and the cold season I was not being able to smoke outside so onto the importance of this battery man so this battery it costed me I think 15 bucks I bought this myself this isn't sponsored at all by use this was a hundred percent me I went to go buy to smoke shop when I was waiting on some other batteries survive and they didn't arrive on time and I had some product knowledge like you know what I dude I'm just even go out and buy a battery because I want to hurry up and try this so I never go into my local smoke shop and they had this battery and it really stood out because I have seen I had seen him around but I thought they were just cheapy batteries and then honestly this was this was the best quality one at that smoke shop and then I was like you know whatever just give it to me give it to me 15 bucks isn't too bad so I bought it and when I opened yeah I was like I was like oh wow like it wasn't as cheap as I thought it was gonna be so I looked in like I got it looked into it and then the material is very very nice the finish is the kind of has like a matte finish they have different colors obviously I just chose the green because it was the best one that they had and one thing that I like about this the first thing that really caught my attention was the variable wattage is on the bottom the turn knob so for $15 the fact that you're getting variable wattage with a turn knob is amazing dude bad batteries out here charging literally 25 to 30 dollars for something like this and they're ugly they're fat batteries and this one is just so thin and so like clean looking and nice and it goes up um it's from 3.3 volts all the way up to four point eight so that's pretty nice who is you really did a good job man they have the little holes right here that you could put any cartridge on this no air flow airflow restriction will be added on so like I said man this this is a very very nice battery and this is why I like it over other ones because you could fit anyone it's stealthy light not like the other ones you know it's nice having it's nice having the other batteries that you can do cool stuff like the preheat function but when do you honestly need a pre heat engine if you're using a cartridge you should always have it upside upside no matter what or else you are already like not taking care of your cartridges because you as if you do know you're not supposed to be having them upside down because you're losing oil so girl Lagoon report amazing dude it gives you such a heavy and nice high actually not even heavy just such a nice high the the notes on it is very very piney very very like a little bit hint of citrusy but more of the piney scent and it's very amazing if you guys don't know gorilla glue number four is my favorite strain by far so we're hopping into the true OG a heavy indica right here oh gee for sure so slapping on the battery and then the for the Alpine you're supposed to be hitting them at 3.7 I'm hitting at this one a 3.8 even because that's where the little dot is that and we're going to turn off the air and then when they see what kind of how massive hits we get at this so true oh gee live resin here we go boys Cheers Oh yup I don't know about you guys but obviously every og is an OG for a reason right so but I don't know if this is just me but or if you guys can tell me but I taste in every og I taste this kind of a similarity which is weird because I've tried strains that are like have the same strain specific strain in it and it tastes different you know you can barely or you can barely even taste it so the fact that they can consistently get this flavor across although g-strings for me personally is pretty crazy but true OG definitely a heavy hitter man whoa just those little hits right there you got me free a super hit highs right off the bat it's a little bit more of a dirty or high for me I like the girl igloo number four it's perfect for me true og is definitely like yeah an indica a nighttime because I'm already feeling down luckily I'm not gonna drive after this I'm just be chillin at the skate park right now for a couple hours go to and then after that just go to Target get some waters go home get ready for work tomorrow continue the grind that continuous grind guys actually have homework to do tonight so we're gonna be doing that also so grind it all the time so cheers boys this is for the people out there working hard every day to make [ __ ] happen I got the water man stay hydrated all the time I've really been taking health until like into more of like way bigger dude way bigger I've been enjoying it a lot more I've even thought about getting into bodybuilding because I've kind of been getting bored of just going and lifting weights just to look good you know I kind of want to challenge myself and do something so I might be getting into bodybuilding I'll see what the world like how hard it is because I already have a hard lifestyle as it is so but that would be pretty fun I mean I'm six foot one six foot two whatever I don't know double check that but six foot two I currently weigh 210 and I want to be honestly at a solid 190 so but just really lean muscle so we're almost there I've definitely definitely been seeing the results like coming in and it makes me happy no consistency is key guys so we're going to take this last hit and we're gonna finish the video because I'm already faded off my ass and then so cheers boys hi I'm not gonna let it go I'm gonna talk over it so I hope you guys enjoyed the video I hope you guys make sure to leave a like comment a sub don't forget to share with your friends do all that good jazz you know we keeping the positivity keeping the content coming the consistency every three days is kind of my schedule that I'm coming on right now which kind of works for me we got some big things coming up steezy big battery coming soon video moon rock coming video coming soon so imma ending here guys I'm faded I gotta go I hope you guys have an amazing day like I said again go make sure I hit that sub button if you're new here and have an amazing day lates", "mUvrLxaSolc": "there's almost no way you can hear the word tequila and not think about colorful Mexico the town of tequila is the birthplace of Mexico's national drink it's a magical town filled with colorful buildings cobblestone streets which are surrounded by hills wine was filled to blue agave plants the mod fragrance of the agave escapes from the furnaces spreading to the town which feels my curiosity to learn more about how the spirit is distilled and who better to learn from than one of a handful women in leadership within the tequila industry and the individuals working at Casa San Mateo's we don't taste factory made but rather a family made tequila with an extraordinary experience [Music] [Applause] I'm Jeff I just retired from the military sold everything I own and now I'm expelling around the world to learn from it news wine makers distillers and tell their story this is my journey a beer wine and spirits [Applause] I took over the company 22 years ago that's was in 1997 and my goal and my passion has been working with the team and become a family with them I really enjoy every day of my life working in san matias and we have created like you know wonderful tequila's for everybody in the world [Music] or agaves are from the highlands of Jalisco Casa Matias and Korres owns tequila's are only made from a Galvez from this region one of the main reasons is because it's part of our DNA of the company and also because we can find here the red soil this soil gives a lot of minerals to the profile of the tequila at the end the guys from this region are really fruity as well that way you can taste the sweetness the main character there is a Jimador que harvest 100 pi\u00f1as birthday or 100 Agatha's birthday which sounds easy but is not easy is really hard [Music] school is this session I'm about to Kio I won't tell you how we got his nickname but if you look at his eyes you understand why so he rose you can find penis from seven years to nine years that is like the common or the average that we use for tequila's so you can have an idea from 60 kilos we can get eight liters of tequila so it's not as much and we need so many and so this balance part of the deal of having a good product at the end in your hand it's part of the process we take it to the distillery and we have an agave patio we call it and we have a patio there and we cut it in half [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] we put it inside a brick oven we just whose recurrence for our process for 48 hours put down as well [Music] [Applause] [Music] and we have to process in our facility one for Honus a modesta hona that is a 100% artisanal process you met pepper yeah we're animal friendly company here so we we created Pepe he's helping us to pleasure degrees on the town we have pine woods or fermentation and a copper steel for destination there so that makes a whole process the old-fashioned way to take unilateral base [Music] and we also have the roller mirror that is the common way to extract the juices from the agave from all the rest of the permits that we have under our portfolio [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so after we crushed the Jews who extract the Jews from from the roller Miller we take it to the bats steel bats for the fermentation that last 72 hours there we have different kind of objects that we use for each brand [Music] [Applause] [Music] and after that we do to this relations in our products their first distillation we've got the tails and heart from the product and after that within the final destination that you were lucky to try a 110 Blanco is right away and we just take it to the proof that we need it for each market and the Reposado and your own extra a\u00f1ejo this is like the room for them we use French oak and we use American oak as well someone previously used in some one of the brands they use new barrels new American oak barrels or new French oak barrels as well we have that a lot of times in our products the highest one that is very soul that we have it with six years in French oak barrels so it depends of the brand that we take care of there they're aging here in this facility right now we have two lines one line is for the artisanal products there are really complex barrels that we use for the barrels per hour we can borrow a thousand bottles but in the first line that is that complete we can put the cork on it we can put the label on it we can feel the juice on the bottle we can do 12,000 per hour there what I loved about this this whole experience today was that I get a sense of family and we talked about with Carmen the owner I mean you today just everybody just made us feel warm and inviting here and I see that replicated when I try that brand too as well I can't thank you enough for allowing us to come show us how tequila is made and again I appreciate it man thank you so much [Music]", "V8IS6MQp1Kg": "[Music] hey guys it's shoes that here to talk to you about Tahoe blue vodka as you know you can see my recipes at Radio Alice calm and I have a new one for you this is very simple and it's so delicious of course we need our Tahoe blue vodka you could pour in 1.5 ounces a little bit more I know the recipe ingredient list is on your screen and coz I love my Tahoe blue vodka so much whoo maybe too much want to put that in there and then it just requires two more ingredients now we're gonna stir it up pineapple juice as much as you like but that it's good enough for me and then I'm gonna top it off with just some club soda simple as that and I feel like this drink is really healthy so you could drink more because it's so healthy that isn't my friends three ingredients Tahoe blue vodka this is called the Tahoe blue vodka pineapple express it's perfect check out more recipes radio alice calm", "UhTTHHuJ0m4": "how's it going everyone dang flippy here and we're gonna be trying some blue products right now we got more votes to try the vanilla and give away the cherry crush and so let's open this [ __ ] up and try it I've never tried one of these but they have a 2.4% Nick that's not much so this shouldn't be too bad I like the packaging it's a [ __ ] joke two point for Nick and it's only got one milliliter I personally don't like disposable just because I can't reuse them obviously but let's try it out now that does taste like vanilla actually I'm pretty surprised about that it's the draw is it kind of reminds me of the caboose I'm Tomas because it's not a lot of airflow but if you get them out the production is actually pretty good let's try to do a blanket on these I'm pretty sure [Music] whoa-ho-ho you said I can do it it started slowing down though oh that was rough they got like really hot towards the end I don't know I didn't see a blink I could usually do blinker hits on on this one I couldn't though but um that's this one we're gonna be giving out uh this cherry crush later on this week I'll probably do like spin the wheel or something like share my videos yeah those are vanilla review overall not bad actually I don't know if I'd read by these just because I'm gonna be trying other ones too in other videos and giving away but I'll probably keep this for the week we're just shooting with a pelican but either way goes it was pretty good I'd recommend it for eight books I think it was not bad alright you [Music]", "dhbFau7l_ZA": "hi everybody and welcome back so today we've got another e-liquid review and this one is going to be on the ice monster line this is the straw melon apple and this one has a really really unique description this one is a straw melon apple is a satisfying fusion of fruits and refreshing menthol so this does have menthol in it if you like that you're really gonna probably like this type of flavor don't feel like you're on a tropical beach as hints of strawberry watermelon apple and mint flavors take turns exciting your taste buds as you inhale straw melon apple vape juice strawberry flavors tingle on your taste buds as its sweet taste sends you off to paradise then a sweet watermelon flavor and a complimentary crisp apple taste quenches your thirst as you exhale an ice cold menthol stream cools you down this does come in 75 vg 25 pg so let's go ahead and try this i do have mine in three milligrams of nicotine you can find this on brad's vapor if you go there you can actually use the coupon code wendy vapes 10 gets you 10 off of anything on the website and i do have a fresh wig right here i smelled it like when i put it down the watermelon is coming through really really nice so let's see what happens i mean okay so i'm gonna go ahead and wet the cotton and the coil i love watermelon vapes i don't know about you but i really do and i'm not i'm not opposed to um menthol flavors i sometimes i think that it needs it um in the different types of flavors like drinks and things like that or ice creams i don't mind a little bit of menthol because it like makes it more realistic to me so there we go i'm smelling that watermelon like crazy smelling it okay so we have it all ready and again this is the straw melon apple let's have a vape oh my god okay so it's not too mentholy which is really great so you're not gonna be like going like that so it's not too mentholy but it's really really good on the inhale you're getting the strawberry and on the exhale you are getting the watermelon in the apple the mince i think ties in with that coolness i don't really taste like a mint mint but it really ties it all together it definitely feels like it's a tropical drink um definitely in in my opinion this i would say like it would work perfectly and i like flavors like this in like pods and pod mods things like that that are a little bit more restrictive i think that because it tones down the um the menthol i think you'll probably like it that way these flavors really really come across and thrive in pod mods i find and i absolutely love them now in regular i love it as well on rdas rtas and everything else but i mainly use it for that so if you're thinking about something like that that might be you know or you're hesitant about the menthol that might be something for you to think about but honestly there's not a lot of menthol it's not like over cooling it mixes with those flavors and it kind of brings them out a little bit more in my personal opinion i'm absolutely loving this i love the strawberry with the watermelon and that apple i didn't know how that would tie in but it's really really nice and crisp you've got that nice sweet watermelon and i'm talking about it's super sweet watermelon it is so good i i would definitely bake this all day like for sure all day this would this would be definitely in my line if you like strawberry you like watermelon you like apple which you really don't get like an in-your-face apple but if you like any of those flavors or you like them mixed together you definitely want to look into this again this is the ice monster line but you can use them like in pots and stuff and it doesn't come through as too icy if that's what you're worried about so i really really like this even in an rta i will i'll be rocking this this is really really great flavor and when you're smelling it because i can smell it when i'm good to take a vape i'm smelling pure fresh watermelon like a juicy juicy watermelon it's if you know what it reminds me of it reminds me of watermelon now and layers that's what the vibe i'm getting from it really really nice and juicy yep that's good so if you want to head over to brad's paper again he does have this in stock and it does come in zero three and six milligrams of nicotine and you can use the coupon code wendy vapes tend to get you ten percent off of everything on the website

"NxEAgqkpn1k": "if you could buy the packaging online then you don't know what is in it but this could have been cup of vitamin e caught with something else kind of sauce you know i got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign", "DzMWwTY0XwI": "hey y'all doing it the smoke here come another view today this one's gonna be a little bit different I'm gonna be reviewing another very product this is going to be the my blue so blue east cigarettes been a while around for a while United States they got really popular I think kind of when they started coming out with the disposables many years ago they've obviously moved on to bigger better technology now and this my blue is actually the next best thing they got to offer I'm pretty first thing I noticed there used to be a vape on the market called Obon Earl I'm not sure if they still make that but I'm pretty sure this company that bought that design or they bought that company that makes mine are old and yeah this is the my blue e-cigarette so yeah this is the starter kit I'm gonna be reviewing the actual device and then the flavor that comes with it so this comes with the flavor golden leaf which is that kind of a tobacco flavor I believe that's there that's a regular tobacco flavor so what comes inside the box what opens up like that the pot is inside of here and then a nice little box presentation register your device at that blue website Mike here yeah yeah so nice little packaging for that so what you get you get the my mood device right here this is kind of how it looks right there so this is the pod pods are pretty cool I believe they got a pretty pretty decent size pods to the 1b ah so 1.5 million your pods so you're talking double the size of jewell pods 2.4% is the nicotine level on the on the flavors from not mistaken so you got pod goes in like such I'm snaps in like that and yeah and then it's ready to go charging port on the bottom it does take a regular like a Samsung charger design so you get the little box right here with that - I'll pull off the charger just to show you all guys what comes in this box yeah and it's just a little my blue USB - whatever that is charger right there so yeah that's good you also get little user manual in the box and then you also get a like redemption code thing for ma to join blue nation so yeah so take a look at the actual device itself it's it's pretty nice it's compact um it's still a little bit bigger in the jewel but um me as a cigarette smoker and stuff like that I kind of like having these lighter little device like this because I kind of like holy install it kind of like a regular cigarette I don't like sometimes I hold vapes like that but a lot of the time I like to kind of hold it like a regular cigarette to keep that to have that similar feel and it is light enough for that so it's yeah it's got a good feel on that device is kind of rounded it's got like a cool oh it's got a cool it's got a little bit of a different design but yeah mouthpiece is right there without further ado skip the my blue shop well as you can see when you're getting it that light does light up on there I think I'm not mistaken I think when the battery's low that my turn to read I'm not mistake though there are something like dang so one thing I'm noticing apparently this is 2.4 percent nicotine but it's it's hitting like twice as hard to the Joule doesn't the jiggles fight for Sun oh wow that's got a that's got a big kick to it yeah that's kinda that's got a lot of let's have a lot of kick 42.4% alright well the device pretty much so far I don't have complaints on it it's it's a little bit bigger than a Joule it's not that bigger I've gotten used to that Joule having that magnetic little charging things so to me these like I don't like I really don't that Joule magnetic charger things really cool um but yeah I mean the only downside with the dual thing is that you know if you got a charge it sideways or upside down you know there's limitation of doing that you know this charger is nice because you can just plug it in any outlet and just run the cable out and have this blue sitting anywhere um just but it's you know it's another cable you got to have you know but then again you know everyone's got their designs for stuff I don't know I'm thinking that a lot um especially a tobacco flavor that gold leaf um that's it's really good I'm surprised how strong it's hitting um like it's hitting strong and I don't know how because it's 2.4% like jewel-box uh that's 5% this is 2.4 and it hits like a train home it's literally like hitting twice as hard when the jewel does which is great it's a pretty decent tobacco flavor it is pretty different like I said when it comes to the vape stuff everyone's got their own you know all these juice companies and stuff place that make you know they make this tobacco flavors it's very hard to emulate a good tobacco flavor and pretty much everyone has their own way of making the tobacco flavor it's not all cut and dry and how they do the mixing for the flavors and stuff laver ings and stuff like that everyone I kind of all have a different taste to him this one definitely does it's sweet kind of bold kind of bold on the flavor a little bit [Music] but the the key thing with this I believe is how hard this hits especially me as a cigarette smoker this is like that's actually like pretty pretty satisfying I I said I I love the jewel I use the jewel religiously but this thing like I don't like Julie I guess you get used to it after a while and stuff like that but for me yeah like sometimes the jewel pots hit good sometimes they don't so far this start this starter kit pod is like hitting really really good with this my blue yeah I know I'm new yeah I'll do a body check on her as you can see it does produce pretty dang good vapor I mean it's really good the draw is very easy on here yeah I'll just think I'll take a small bowl and even that small little pole I can still feel that and I'm you know taking a bigger one obviously see not bad that's it's really good that tobacco flavor is actually pretty good too oh and the thing with me is that like because I like these tobacco flavors oh that tobacco like the nicotine has to be a certain it has to be a certain strength to really hit home especially if it's someone who's like a cigarette smoker we trying to switch to a product like these that strength is really going to dictate whether or not someone's like a cigarette smoker is going to try and actually stay on this product not to mention to find a good flavor and have a consistent flavor I like this tobacco a lot this is a it's pretty it's pretty good literally no complaints with that some to some people I think that this might be a little bit strong for them just away this hits but it does hit really good it smacks so I'm very impressed with that very impressed yeah it's nice I might even I'm probably gonna start using this a little bit more definitely um yeah I mean I really don't have much more to say on this blue product but um it's pretty good um like I said I I smoke cigarettes but I started kind of getting into these little salt and make small you know base pod devices and stuff like that which are really popular in the market right now and the jewel did you will won me over but this my blue is actually pretty good and if I said if I'm not mistaken this looks like a Bond girl there used to be a vape call of honor all that was out and that was kind of getting a little bit popular I if I'm not mistaken I think this I think blue e-cigarette actually bought this company if I'm not mistaken because this is like the exact same design it just says my blue on it it just is blue pretty much so yeah bonner all had a lot of different flavors of stuff like that I think the pot I think they sell the pods for these things and packs of two if I'm not mistaken it mind you I think they might think the pot de creville in Rob I think a pack of 2 pots for these devices I think it retails for $9.99 in stores and that's pretty good considering that they are double the size so and technicality you're getting for jewel pods for $10 and then if you buy four pods of these you're like you're double so it's I think it's a pretty good deal especially price-wise and with how good this tobacco taste I mean I like this I mean I'm very picky when it comes to some of these tobacco flavors this one and I really like the Virginia jewel to Becca Virginia tobacco the jewel pod flavor that's my favorite this one I think isn't as sweet is it but it's still like it's good enough you know especially for cigarette smokers who are looking for like a nice flavor tobacco flavor who don't like all the fruity stuff and stuff like that it's hard to come by vape flavor you know tobacco vape flavors and sometimes people just mess it up really bad sometimes they kind of make it taste too sweet it's deserty kind of tasting you want to have a nice kind of balance with it especially I think if people want to switch from cigarettes to play devices like these and they want to stand that tobacco flavor it needs to be consistent and it just needs to have certain characteristics then you know cuz I've watched you a lot a lot of people who smoke for a while they try to get on these these vapors and stuff like that and people sell them the wrong products they go to vape stores and stuff like Daddy you know they sell them the wrong stuff and it's stuff that cigarette smoke because I want to move it cigarette smokers don't really want to start changing out coils and pouring juice and tanks and stuff like that a lot of people they want to keep that same routine going you know if they go to the store buy cigarettes once a I'm gonna go to a store buy my checkup eyes put in my baby you know but these pot these pot device are very nice and is my blue I'm actually very surprised it's very good it's very good but yeah um here yeah but guys I got I really got much for sake um the my blue I'm probably gonna have to rate this thing honestly I'm gonna give this I'm gonna give this in the hand out of town I really like it a lot oh it's compact it's got a really nice kick to it nicotine wise it's got a good flavor for that tobacco um I definitely think I'm gonna review a little bit more of these flavors and stuff like that in the future so yeah but there you have it guys my blue so there you all have it my blue e-cigarette if you've ate definitely give it a shot if you haven't already tried it definitely this is a quality product from

"OcfNmhQxc9Y": "hello friends it's karina from eight vape welcome back to our channel today we are doing another taste test video with cloud nerds this is scraped strawberry strawberry grape grape something open it fill it vape it thanks for the instructions cloud nerds would have never known so strawberry grape i'm guessing it's gonna be strawberry and grape uh let's see if that's what this tastes like definitely tastes like really sugary very very sweet like if you are into like high intensity um like like the power of just like nerds like nerds candy then this will be the one for you it has a really strong um strawberry flavor the grape is a little bit on the subtle side but um overall the flavors do really go well together it's kind of like a pixie stick kind of like nerds it's very very candified so if that's what you're into then you're going to be very pleased with this one hmm would this be a great all day vape i don't know i can already kind of feel like i'm getting a little dehydrated um just because it's so sweet but uh i could definitely see this if you're like a salt nick user if you get this in a salt and put it in a little portable device and take it with you on the go then i think that's the perfect way to experience this because a full tank of this will probably wear you out a little bit it's very intense very in your face so yeah i would recommend it for lighter usage um on the go type stuff or just you know the one that you keep you like in your purse or your car you know one of those things for like your backup i don't know if it would be like my go-to every day unless you're super into like a lot of sugary sweetness and i know a lot of people out there are i used to be more on the extreme sweet side but now i'm finding myself just like have little hints of um sweetness added to certain flavors um yeah yeah i'm more into like fruits and stuff less into the candies these days but if some of you are like fully in the candy zone whatever you want to call it um definitely worth picking this one up cloud nerds grape strawberry i'm gonna give you a seven because you do taste good but you taste almost a little too good and that scares me so you can pick up a little bottle of grape strawberry from cloud nerds on eightvape.com right now the link will be in the description and you can also find in the description links to us on

a cannabis vaporizer alright so with these products it's really nice you don't put a lot of soot or anything like that into your lungs it's much lighter feeling than if you're smoking it all the time and a lot of people don't know how to use these they're very simple so when you go to the store you're looking to spend about you know thirty to fifty eighty dollars always what we call a base of your vaporizer unit they're going to come packaged like this alright so depending on what brand you buy they all look a little different but from the same function you get your base and a charger in the box you're going to screw your charger into the base just like that and these Chargers just slide into simple USB ports you could charge them on your computer you can charge them to where you would plug your you know your phone cable right in there and then this this adapter will just go right into the wall then your vapor ends charging or you plug this right into your computer and now the base is charging okay so very very simple and the charges will last you you know weeks or more so once you get a cartridge once you get a base you're also going to need a vape cartridge which is a extract of cannabis oil and you can again get these in sativa indica hybrid or all CBD oils for example this is all CBD and this is a sativa product so again very simple simply screw the vape cartridge right into your base alright just like that and you're literally ready to go alright so then to use this product you simply depress the button hold it there inhale on the device take one puff see how you feel about five or ten minutes later and then repeat until you are at the level of Medicaid you've reached the level of medication that you wanted to consume and are feeling comfortable just don't use it before you drive besides that that's really how the vaporizers work it couldn't be simpler again if you want to detach this you can detach it be careful to not let the oil leak out if you're going to just rely on this allow around I usually try and set it upright or put the kite of the cap back on and that's really truly it with the vaporizers we that they're incredibly efficient and convenient way to medicate", "dOwyRDIo1Do": "oh my god it smells so good hmm now he's a bath bomb CBD bath bomb wow that's all smells like laundry detergent oh this is so good we got some gummies blue raspberry rings 500 milligrams each when I walk my load hold the bag oh nice okay so this is just the CBD oil I wonder what thing it cuz that was just like oh and honey okay sweet oh I should know it's got like a little honey of yours I'm actually like most excited for this because I've never tried the actual oil that you just drip I think it's a new tongue right whatever I'll read it in a second but I've never tried this before and I'm excited oh you put it on your phone oh whoa I actually you know what I would actually use the out of this with my ID in my debit card in there nice okay we got some pain cream here 100 milligrams last but certainly not least a nice little rolling tray thank you guys you know I smoke weed a biodegradable rolling tray that's cool nice feels really weird because it's my first sponsored video so I just want to start off by saying I actually do really like CBD and I've been using it for a while the last time you guys see me talk about CBD it was actually a funny story I had my mom bring me like a little gummy bears and then a pain cream that was CBD to the hospital and I was doing daily vlogs back when I was just in the hospital blogging and um and I blogged about it and I don't know who in that hospital was stocking my but they saw that I had CBD and they're like well that's a drug and we need to search the rest of your things to make sure that you're not hiding any other drugs and I was like bro it's not like um in here shooting up meth or known smoke man showed us how much I know about drugs like I'm in here eating a CBD gummy bear and now you guys are gonna go like literally search my entire hospital room and they did and they didn't find anything go figure okay anyways moving on but this is my first sponsored video it's sponsored by just CBD I really like them I had them send me a couple of things to try out before I made a video just because I wanted to make sure I actually liked it before it's like hey guys go spend your money on this and it's something that I have never tried I wouldn't like that if somebody did that to me so I'm not going to do that to you guys so they sent me the gummies which I'm on my last one so I'm really happy that things like me more and I did it just empty it I actually take these like every day and then they also sent me like a roll on roll on fries pain relief this okay this Sun is gonna start coming in take this for the eared it's half of my face wow that's really great oh nice thank you cloud anyways like I was saying the blue line my son's that I've asked blue eyes are like sorry I'm gonna be squinting probably the rest of stuff yeah all right so I did try this and I'm actually gonna use this right now because it's been a long day for me and my shoulders are hurting but this the best way to describe this is if you've ever used Biofreeze it reminds me of that but it has CBD in it so it's like Biofreeze on steroids it's just better than Biofreeze because it has the CBD in it and I feel like it feel like it is colder than Biofreeze to and I love that it's a Rollie so you can get hard-to-reach spots see I'm citizens okay okay so the freeze is 350 milligrams and the cream is 100 milligrams just want to give you guys some milligrams cuz that actually matters and let me just yeah I'm really excited about this but I don't take baths because getting in another about tub in a wheelchair I've seen people do it online but I'm just not ballsy enough to try it but common-sense water body that will still work in the shower so I'm actually really excited to try this it really smells like laundry detergent and everybody knows there's no better smell in the world the motion detection I'm excited too like a picture it's really good it's hard to keep one it's actually they taste like candy mmm zero fat zero cholesterol two grams of carbs one gram of sugar is not bad at all well it's got like nothing in a festive eating exam many calories 5 colors nice and then there's 24 and each container just giving you guys the facts you know you know what I'm going to do because mmm because this is only 100 milligrams I'm gonna mix it with the roll-on it should make a difference so it's got a little pump I'll show you this if you like a real youtuber one I guess it's not really thick it's like in between being sick and wiry it's really nice consistency doesn't like anything it's unscented which is nice not only because that's like extra chemicals but I have really sensitive skin so when stuff has fragrance it makes me break out a lot of times okay so I take these dummies everyday and at first I was using them to help fall asleep at night but I already take I have insomnia and I have medication that I take a night telling me sleep so I don't know how much of it was the gummies or how much medicine so I took it during the day the next day and it does make you a little tired almost like the equivalent of smoking weed like you get a little tired from it but it's not something that you wouldn't be able to take during the day because it's gonna make you too tired so the best way to describe how they make you feel is I live in the city I live in Chicago if you don't know this so there's a ton of people there's a ton of tourists and a lot of the times when I go out little things that people do that shouldn't your take me because it's just it's not a big deal they do irritate me like if I hold the door for somebody and they don't say thank you I'm literally that person that goes yeah you're welcome like if you think I'm such a blunt  sometimes but these the easiest way to describe it is it makes you just not care if that person doesn't say think holding the door for them it's just like it makes putting up with idiots easier mmm like it sounds bad but there's a lot of them in this world and we can use something to help us deal with that and this so if you don't want to smoke weed and you want the same like not giving a feeling CBD it actually does do exactly what I just said so I'm gonna assume that five hundred fifty milligrams famous the chewy it's nice okay I'm gonna assume that the oil does the same thing but since I just took one of the gummies I don't want to take the oil because I'm not gonna know which one is the oil would be able to give you like full it should have thought about that before I just got too excited in any one you know what I'll take this in a little bit once this wears off and then I'll try this and I'll do it on camera just so that you guys can see because I I feel like I'm doubling everything right now like I just put on the fries and I'm the cream which I'm not gonna lie to you I have really done that pain ever since you know I broke my neck so ever since that I deal with really bad chronic constant chronic pain and I don't take any pain killers for it I don't get any cortisone shots I used to and I'm gonna start again actually but at the moment I don't so it's really nice to have like an option where I don't have to smoke weed like if I'm going to meeting and my modeling agency I can just use something like this instead of having to smoke weed before something important like that you won't have to suffer through the pain because I'm not gonna smoke weed before important meetings like that so I just suffered through the pain when it comes to that so it's nice to have something that I could use during the day and you know professionals that nice and but I'm not gonna lie my neck actually feels really good right I think the mixture of the roll-on fries the cream and the gummy is making my pain a lot better right now Wow I've been up since 6:00 a.m. I had to go to an appointment so I've been up and about and in my chair for what times you know like five so I've been up for 11 hours in my chair now so my neck usually starts to hurt after like three hours but now I don't really I'm not even just saying this but you guys - it really does feel good like this that hurt but like I have full range of motion right now and I'm not wincing usually I'm like if I do what I just did Wow guys I remember saying this the first time I ever tried CBD I was like wow I wasn't expecting anything but that just really impressed me put this thing on my phone yeah tonight what I'll do is when all of this wears off I'll try this because the thing that I was most excited to try and then it was just the bottom of the box so now I'm like I really want to try this so imma try this tonight and we're gonna see how it works but in the meantime let's put this cute little wooden we call it mobile pouch my phone but just stuff in there nice I went it's a rubber to it like that [Music] can represent everywhere echo Mini's and then Milo they were thinking about you - yeah you got your football bags I wonder if you get to offset the oil I mean I see people getting their dogs CBD treats what's difference right it's just funny make a good dog for me should I or shouldn't I maybe I should just wait until I get dog shits out become dog CPD treats will get you some CBD too so you don't feel like you're losing out okay I can't really show you guys that's what I'm gonna do I was just gonna say I can't show you guys you know me testing out the bath bomb but tonight when I take a shower I'm gonna use this and then I'm gonna take some of the oil you know take some oil that way I'll have tried everything and can give you a full review right all right well that's everything until then I'm gonna go make use of mine biodegradable roaming trick okay I'll see you guys tonight okay so I just got out of the shower and I used the bath bomb oh my god I mean no I'm smelling bath bomb if I could just smell myself I smell good see I've never used a bath bomb because I don't take baths so I never understood the whole thing but my skin is so soft and I smell so good oh my god now I see why everybody's so obsessed literally smells like laundry detergent no I smell like longitude it hurt oh I love it okay so I have the drops right here and I'm going to go take one to two times and hold under your tongue for 30 to 60 seconds okay this is to shake it really good someone may shake it says to hold under tongue for 30 seconds so be like what are you doing good I should put down in my tea wow they taste really good well it's hard to like not take more because it tastes really good okay well I'm gonna go wal kay Milo hmm I don't want to say it um I'm gonna go do that and then by the time I get back this should all kick in these drops I do feel relaxed but I mean I did take a lot of CBD today I mean I put the roll on the cream and I took a 500 milligram gummy and then I just bathed myself in CBD and now I just took some CBD honey so I'm probably gonna sleep like the best I've ever slept in okay well I just got inside and I am ready for bad I don't know if you can tell by my voice but I'm so tired I don't know if it's all of this CBD that my body has consumed today but I'm like oh I'm just ready for bed so yeah today was fun I actually really enjoyed doing this whole unboxing try it out for the first time I've never done anything like this so it was pretty cool um it really helps that I like CBD so I knew I would most likely like these products but I really liked the bath bomb and I know you're probably thinking your hair is and wet like you didn't take a shower but I just washed my hair this morning so I didn't wash it again cuz I'm gonna have to restrain it and whatever but that bath balm I just went in the elevator when I was walking my low to go walk my low I'm sorry I'm like really out of it I don't know if it's like the oil or what but I'm like really tired all of a sudden I think it's that oil cuz I'm like feeling stupidly tired but um I got an elevator and Cindy was like oh my god he smells so good and I was like think it sounds like it's this bath bomb I didn't say it like that um that it more casually but it's like yeah it's this new bath bomb that I got and even they said they're like you smell like um fabric softener I was like bro that's what I it smells like tied it smells so good anyways I really enjoyed today I really enjoyed trying out these products for you guys you guys should definitely go check them out I will link all of their stuff in the description box thank you to just see BD first sponsoring this video and I will see you guys next time good night", "Xa9to9SOz3U": "don't bother asking me to trade you this one hey aficionados sean here with another beer from magnify and it's another one of their trade proof beers this one is with mango guava cherry and strawberry it is 4.5 abv it's a fruited goza previously i reviewed another variant it was more of a berry based variant i don't remember the exact ingredients i really liked it i was kind of just like blown away by how like it literally just kind of drinks like a like a fruit smoothie it's so it was so like thick and had literal pulp in the beer pretty insane to be honest i really liked it but the longer that i drank it i don't know the thickness the the novelty of it kind of like began to like wear on me it does not drink like a beer really at all and from pouring this one out and from like seeing the way it sticks to the glass this one is just gonna be as thick and as pulpy but again the flavor of the first one was off the charts so looking forward to digging into this one too yeah so the aroma it smells like you're smelling a smoothie it does not smell like you're you're like smelling a beer at all it just smells like pureed mango it smells like pureed strawberry a little bit of like a cherry kind of sweetness and uh that guava mango again the guava mango tropical character with a little bit of like pureed like fresh strawberry and just a hint of cherry like a hint of a cherry sweetness maybe it's my mind playing tricks on me even but like i almost feel like i get like the aroma of like yogurt or something like that like it smells like like one of those flip top yogurts with like like it was like a mango like strawberry version pretty insane let's get the taste just yeah i mean same thing as the first time around with the first trade proof this is like thick with like five c's chewy for days pulp for days cd like you're getting like the strawberry seeds and you're like your teeth even this does not drink like a beer it drinks like a smoothie like a fruit smoothie like it tastes like you took mango and strawberry and maybe some cherries and some guava put it in a blender and called it beer it is just fresh pureed mango for days fresh strawberry for days little hints of cherry it's not too cherry forward and i'm kind of glad because i feel like i feel like the cherry might be it might have been a little bit too much if it was like one of the stronger notes it's just in there providing a little bit of sweetness like i kind of get on the tail end a little bit to me it's more about the guava big time guava mango with a little bit of the strawberry playing in and like a hint of the cherry and again mine playing tricks on me it it makes me think of like smoothies it makes me think of like those flip top yogurts like i mentioned already very thick very chewy and filling that was one of my issues with the original one the longer that i drank it off-screen it they're filling beers for 4.5 percent the mouth feels off the charts like this is like full body plus plus like this thing is thicker than most imperial stouts that i drink um it's not gonna be for everyone that's for sure pretty sweet but it's got a tartness to it that balances out the sweetness and i think because like the sweetness the fruitiness feels so fresh and so real it doesn't really come off as cloying like it feels like real fruits you know um it doesn't feel artificial at all the longer you sit with it the more you do start to notice that sour character coming through the tartness coming through again it's like this tart strawberry like tart mango and guava it blends the tartness blends with the fruits that are in this one alright so my final thoughts on trade proof with mango guava cherry strawberry this one's gonna get an a plus for me this beer is not for everyone though again the mouthfeel it's insane like it's it's thick it's chewy it's it's got pulp it's got seeds it does not really drink like a beer necessarily it drinks a lot like a smoothie but the flavors in this are off the charts like fresh fruits for days and i really like the blend of fruits that are in this one even more so than the last one and just the uniqueness you can't deny the uniqueness in these beers at all they're worth seeking out even just for the novelty but if you like fruited beers you're gonna enjoy this one like it it's hard to to not enjoy if you can get over the thickness the mouth feel the chew the the pulp that's in this have any of you tried this variant of trade proof have you had any other variants of trade proof what do you think of this series is it off-putting to you do you enjoy this series do you think it even should even really be considered beer let me know your thoughts in the comments below until next time drink responsibly and passionately thanks for watching", "XBB1JvdcD8Y": "[Music] what up YouTube mature man Sam back in the building [ __ ] today another

today I want to talk about the blue six starter kit now this is the kit that helped me quit smoking cigarettes now originally I'd gone out and bought a few of these which are their disposables and they're excellent however I'm holding about 20 bucks in my hand so definitely not a long-term solution first step recommendation though after trying those I knew I was good on cigarettes so what's going to smoke anymore so I went out and got the blue six starter kit and for me that was the game changer so that being said let's go ahead and check out the kit first of all comes on a nice 30 bucks it also has a nice magnetic flap up front that holds a box shut and if we open up the box see that has a nice three step instruction diagram some flavor cartridges accessories on the bottom and a charging pack all right well let me go ahead and open up the rest this box and show you some more details of the blue sake starter kit all right now that I've opened up the box let's go through the list of what the kit includes first it comes with a mini brochure and operators manual two batteries a variety pack of five flavor cartridges which include two classic tobacco one cherry crush one magnificent menthol and one Java jolt a wall charger a USB charger and the charging pack with a USB cable to charge the back alright let's go ahead and dive into the close-up details of the blue six starter kit all right now that you've seen the product demonstration let me tell you what I thought of the original blue six starter kit some pros are this is the kit that I quit smoking cigarettes on so I can say it worked for me local availability was also a huge plus I liked that I could go pick up a kit in town instead of waiting for an online order to be shipped to me the cartomizers connected with the batteries are the same size as a cigarette just slightly heavier the portable charging case is designed to look like a pack of smokes which i think is really cool so those are some pros some cons our battery life is extremely poor I had to buy two extra batteries to keep out with my vaping habits and the nicotine levels are also low so I was blazing through these cartomizers which are expensive five cartomizers come in a pack for 16 bucks so I was smoking about two cartomizers a day it's still cheaper than my smoking habit but not by much so I think for it to work you had to smoke the Blues sparingly but I almost guarantee you that you're going to vape at least twice as much as you smoke cigarettes so if you're like smoker this might be perfect for you but at this point I think I recommend this kit and most analogue style kits more as a stepping stone at first I didn't like the way ego batteries with the clearomizer look so that's why I bought this kit but a week later I bought an ego battery starter kit with clearomizers so you know I definitely regret it and it was worth the 60 bucks to quit smoking cigarettes but it's whatever works for you currently you know I love vaping and all the cool products that go with it not just analogue style kits and I use this kit for about a month off and on until all my smoking urges were gone so vaping really does help make that transition by providing all the cool stuff that you love about smoking cigarettes just without the cancer carcinogens so you can save a few bucks by getting you a an ego battery starter kit or an analog starter kit that's what you need because I did but I still enjoy baking these just more for fun and convenience rather than a necessity so with that being said I wish you the very best on your journey to quit smoking cigarettes I'll put a direct link and a coupon linked to the blue cigs website below if you want to get started as always thanks for watching please connect with me on my social sites have an excellent day and see you next time we would be honored you", "G7GklIFSSAU": "Delta time THC there's now a huge thread regarding that and don't live when we had a fun little for it for take a little for a layman's background so so depending it specifically yeah everybody's different and I'll all have their own special ways of a festival but depending on where or how the different pieces of the molecule are laid out you you know the difference between THC delta 9 and T and C a is th EA has a carbolic acid molecule in its tail and no boxer group carboxyl group and in another thing there's Delta 88 C which has gotten really popular with the water clear trend and people would you know they would throw a bunch of carbon and some acids and stuff into their boiling flask and then they'd start distilling it and it's coming out beautiful water clear they sent test results or they'd sent testing labs and then it's yeah like very low percentage of Delta 9 THC eventually we started they got standards for Delta 88 C then started quantifying that there's more THC in us that there is but then there's still a little missing piece that like you'd see you know 60 to 70 80 percent cannabinoids and this water clear stuff that you know it's all cannabinoids and there's plenty of isomers and stereo isomers of THC and these are things that happen through different reaction their reactions that happen through heating and the presence of acids and bases and given the different environmental things or what was sprayed on those so that that can actually be a big indicator what's happening into the reactions as well so so good all that distillation method we're like you put stuff in a pot it boils at different temperatures and all that well throw catalyst in that pot that you don't know is there like you know people spray put sulfur on their plants or people you know certain things get sprayed on plants and when you concentrate that thing in a hot flask under vacuum where fires and fire attack there's a whole bunch of ways you could do that but to go back to Delta 10 Delta 10 is simply an unknown type of THC that until recently was it is yes in different income in different ways they affect all three of those can affect a single person completely different no they've been discovered but they're only being mass-produced yeah they yeah macula vanilla and knows about him and he has and we are just now mass producing them because we have the freedom of the market to start and start playing and then we also have the competition in the market to try to make the clearest most beautiful looking oil which you know well it used to be Delta 8 th DW I mean I we can I know use I'm saying historically historically when they first started getting this perfectly clear bottle of oil it was Delta eight and they would do this refluxing carbon acids and but but but yeah and that was it then they would use a catalyst in the flask that they were boiling in one we're talking about people who appreciate the clarity that clear net the secret is that the consumer is that an expert consumers okay and what's your opinion on consumers have been led to believe that the clear the oil is well and and and that clear could come from a lot of different things it can be cut with another clear oil that it makes you know just diffuses what color is in there there's a lot of things that can clarity is definitely an indicator of purity though it was an indicator but the a slight yellow amber tint the these are little little atomic level refractions that are happening with chromophores that hold into the the tail end of the molecule these these are what a chromophore is uncle mela these they're they're basically like atomically small things that will refract light at a different color so you have so by breaking that bond you you like that's when people distill with certain things on the flask you can break that at that chromophore bond and it you can also break that bond by through chromatography as well which people eventually developed a method for Delta 9 THC does anyone clear water clear yeah and it that was just a method of taking a single pass distillate and then passing it through a series of usually magnesium silicate or floor so actually and then but different color remediating adsorbents that were also being used to remediate past asides and they still are used to remediate pesticides and it just happened that you make water clear delta 9 after remediating pesticides properly as sometimes depending on the oil and what kind of colors and that the condition THC 8 and 10 have been known for and their-their prevalent in the same way that THC is in Canada like there is it kind of like a is it a totally different cannabinoid that is in very low percentages in well zombie health of ours not so much on the cultivar it's a reaction through processing so you're not gonna have those you're not gonna have a bunch of Delta eight or delta10 any in your flowers you're gonna have it in a kind of a crazy their isomers correct and it was the one thing everything we're talking about is like the ability to narrow the bands of what you're capturing well if you cuz you're right it's it's these little slices but the only way that's possible is that we've now created these massive machine that will process a lot so we get bigger trends you know we we see information come out of plant material from farms all over California grown differently going different ways different yields different strengths different compounds or the makeup of the cannabinoids in that specific strain like it's really interesting we get to see a lot of those so at the same time as we're narrowing the focus and really like getting to chop down into you know now we're we just picked up a machine that will separate out individual cannabinoids so you can collect them individually it's a centrifugal partitioning chromatography this company called rodeo cron they catch it you guys okay yeah sorry THC eight and ten are kind of like mine or like other cannabinoids that we've known about it but haven't been able to isolate so on the market are we gonna eventually see like THC eight tinctures and THC ten tinctures in the same way that we see other kind of my hair cannabinoid totally and we've been seeing mostly we've been seeing a lot of THC eight cart hay in cartridges and there is subsequently a decent amount of Delta ten THC that's in there well no they're just calling it if you're buying a card off the traditional market you they're saying it's one thing but who knows what really is in that cartridge right so but because you can take garbage oil and by attorney by doing this process to convert it to Delta eight clean it up to make it look clear a lot of guys do that ii buy a really cheap oil get a little bit of a fraction of that off and this really nice-looking oil and then it's just cheaper the way that that's produced then I like water clear Delta nine it takes extremely expensive absorbance and a process to do it with the Delta eight you throw some activated carbon in their flask and if you distill right here you can get water clear I mean there's a few other a few other parameters to change but you just dump a bunch of garbage in your flask and then just mix it with your oil and your oil is coming out nicely that was what a bunch of people were doing to fix their dark oil especially in the early day when people really weren't distilling very well", "evvF6jFQWXI": "hey guys welcome to hotbox

describe just a rich vanilla cake sweet buttercream with fresh blueberries drizzled with sweet sugar glaze so I'm gonna go ahead and I won't lie I've already tasted it this is like probably the only bottle I've ever done that with but they told me to try it so I did and I'm gonna put it down so we're gonna go ahead and put this on my I n 24 RDA which is actually what I tried it on and it was

this I love love love this flavor you get the natural fresh and I'm talking French like fresh you can't get any fresher blueberries fresh blueberries on the inhale and on the exhale you get the buttercream with the cake and then that buttercream it lingers with the glaze it's so this is phenomenal this is like eating a real blueberry cake I've never even had a blueberry cake and I want it

to finish vaping this and I'll see you on the next clip", "UcCyGRkODX4": "the basic series blueberry cake from glass paper so glass paper reached out to me to review their basics line and this is blueberry cake and according to the box which got has a ton of information on it this has the flavor notes of vanilla blueberry cream and cake it has a 5 out of 5 vapor production 4 out of 5 flavor strengths and 1 out of 5 throat hit so shouldn't have much throat hit at all and this is a 70/30 VG PG e-juice by the way all that information is also on the bottle so they say that this won the Best in Show for desserts at the 2017 vapor expo UK so it must be good has rich vanilla cake sweet buttercream and fresh blueberries drizzled in a sweet sugar glaze you can get it in 60 ml bottles for 1695 and nicotine strengths of 0 3 & 6 it smells like a blueberry cake but like an artificial blueberry cake not a real one I can smell both the blueberry and cake flavors I can't really smell the cream or vanilla flavors but really that that blueberry smell comes through I let my wife smell this one too and she thought it smelled kind of musty so which makes me think that they're using bilberry here because you hear that a lot from DIY mixers who try bill berry I'm not one of those people who can get that smell though so I'm vaping this on the smoke Pro color at 97 watts with the goon 1.5 RDA on top and built at point 27 ohms this one is really smooth practically no throw hit at all the flavor definitely tastes like blueberry to me but it's not strong as a unique mild taste to it too this one is unique I'm having a hard time identifying the flavors I get a little bit of that cake and cream in there and it's also pretty sweet but it has a slight hint of something that sort of reminds me of black licorice on the exhale and that black licorice flavor to me is really light and I can barely taste it but that's what it tastes like to me I really don't mind it though I think it's a pretty good blueberry cake a juice with a really unique twist to it and I've seen a lot of reviews of this and I haven't seen anyone else say that it tastes like black licorice so don't let that you know ruin it for you it's got a lot of really good reviews so if it's something that you're interested in go check it out at glass vapor calm", "LTYza0TGrIc": "[Music] mr. Shah we're here to do another quick ela car review this time we're gonna be taking a look at another flavor from the basics line by glass this is a buttercream blueberry cake I actually use this to set up my Athena squonk kit I just did post a review on that so if your just to check that out I'm not sure if it's gonna be before after you never know but I have been truly loving it this thing rocks on an RDA so let me just go ahead and give it a vape and I'll let you guys know it I'm tasting this thing is buttercream on the forefront to me you get that nice rich buttercream on the forefront and the and the blueberry cake is on the back end it's very very subtle which i think is nice because for me I'm a huge buttercream fan so the fact that the blueberry is kind of in the background works for me I really really like it I think it's amazing on an RDA especially at higher wattages you're getting all those notes this does come in a 60 ml bottle I have it three milligrams and they katene it all the links you need to know where you can find it will be down below but this one definitely gets two thumbs up for me so if you're looking for something to kind of satisfy that sweet tooth but not be overly sickening sweet I just say give us one ago so I hope you liked this quick eliquid review if you did please give it a thumbs up if any questions or comments you have down below and as always I hope you have an amazing day or night whenever you're watching this stay tuned to the next video and until then beep on [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "Jg2Az55h9CI": "hey this is Dan welcome back to real vape review and today I'm gonna review an electronic cigarette that has been highly requested but I put off until now a friend of mine actually borrowed this to me really fly anyway a friend of mine actually borrowed this to me for the review I wasn't gonna spend my money on it just because I don't really support what blue has done in the past as far as their guerrilla marketing and the way that they treat different like store chains and stuff it's been documented that Blue has gone into places like 7-eleven the circle K's some of the some of the bigger chains across the country and told them that if they don't support blue and carry their product put signage up and promote their product that they're gonna pull all their tobacco products out and honestly don't remember which one blue is you know whether it's I know it's not r.j. Reynolds but whichever one it is lower large or you know well anyway whichever one it is anyway they threatened to pull their tobacco out if they don't put signage up and everything which blocks everybody else and they can't they're not allowed to put up anybody else except for enjoy and views and stuff like that but they just their tactics on way as ways of going about it I don't really agree with plus Big Tobacco needs to stay at Big Tobacco and electronic cigarettes need to do their own thing and by Big Tobacco getting involved with electronic cigarettes now it's putting more of put more of a bad lighting on electronic cigarettes and it's getting looked at now is a little bit you know not what it actually is it is definitely a safer way to go a safer way to do things enough of my rant so yeah this will probably be a little bit biased on this review but I will be as honest as I can on the flavors and everything else as far as the blue now this is the Blu Blu rechargeable kit that gets sold and I think this is my friend paid $40 for this this and first of all it comes with a little car cigarette lighter charger anyway it's got blue written on the end of it right here it's got blue written on there and basically it's just a USB charger you plug into your into your car and yeah it's kind of a neat little look and everything it's got the blue wrapped around there and it also comes with this little recharging cord recharging cord is actually to charge this case and it's got the small USB plug on this and your regular USB plug on this in but one thing I've noticed about this is very very thin it's a very thin and almost fragile looking little wire I'm used to most rechargers having a nice big thick heavy wire this one this blue has a really thin small wire kind of makes me nervous so if you get this you want to be really careful with this cord not to pinch it kink it you know catch it in anything because that is really really soft it's really pliable you know you don't want to break it anyway so they because imagine that they're gonna charge you an arm and a leg get a new replacement cord so anyway the way this works of this rechargeable case is this guy actually has a USB plug right here on the bottom of it you know you can see a USB plug right there on the bottom of it then on this side here it's got two different lights on there so you get to focus the bottom light says that the battery pack is actually charging and the next one says your actual battery on the inside is charging and when you plug it in if the bay it's all fully charged right now but that red one would light up and the that's charging the case when the red light goes off the chases case is charged and when you put a cigarette on the inside of it here and a battery on the inside it will actually charge that battery now this is the actual battery right here do you see it's a little bit spring-loaded and anyway right down inside of there is actually where it's going to charge this battery you don't have to screw it in you just drop it in and then when you close lid it puts a little bit pressure on it and creates that connection to charge that battery up pretty decent idea one problem I've found with the blue that I'm not really a big fan of is it's not interchangeable with the common 9:09 threading they have their own type of threading and I know there's some ecig manufacturers out there that create that make cartridges and stuff that fit the blue batteries and that the blue you know they're vice versa but not very many of them but you take like this that 909 threading on DC smokes it's pretty pretty common and interchangeable blue didn't make it where anybody else could really interchange with their product whatever yeah so that's how you charge a case up and that's how you charge battery up and this is what the actual battery looks like it says blue right on battery decent-looking battery it's a nice really shiny black on there and the typical is gonna light up blue it's definitely a nice-looking little battery for sure but one thing is kind of off to the eye let's pull out this cartridge here just not real appealing to the eye is when you actually put a cartridge on there the cartridge is a flat black and kind of a dull black and then the actual battery is really shiny black so it's a little bit not eye catching you know right off the bat the first flavor I'm going to go ahead and try is going to be a menthol it's got two little leaves there an H for a high nicotine level so I'm going to assume it's an eighteen milligram or twenty four milligram not really positive but yeah it's a menthol but like I say it's a good looking I like black on black if they would have made this shiny or this dull it would have been a lot better but having that shiny battery with a dull flat black on the cartridges it looks a little bit off but it is personal personal preference on what it looks like right this is the menthol now if you guys remember I did a blue disposable menthol sitting right there anyway and it tasted like puppy breath it was god-awful I know that that was a bad cartridge because I couldn't taste any menthol at all this one however is a new cartridge and it's fresh and anyway I've tried all these and I've tested them all out anyway I know it's a fresh new cartridge so let's go ahead and check it out get that fan off me just a little miss you can see the body over here pretty weak body not allowed not a lot of strength to it now the flavor of menthol it's definitely a menthol flavour it's not a good menthol flavour I taste puppy breath still now I went through four different mental cartridges trying to see if you know and two of them are two of them from one pack and to them from or another pack and anyway to see if it was just maybe one of the sides packs whatever I tried four of them out all four of them had that exact same case to it so that is just the flavor that they have I taste the menthol it's got a decent aftertaste well no vice versa it's got a almost decent taste but the aftertaste taste like puppy breath it's kind of got that really bitter aftertaste really sticky not real great so let's go ahead and try this one more time you see baby production is pretty weak on it doesn't have a lot of vapor production but the flavor like I said I can taste the menthol going in as soon as it comes out I get puppy breath flavor big-time it's got a really bitter aftertaste not a good flavor at all like I said I've tried for different menthol ones plus that one up there it's all I get is puppy breath and I was trying I really wanted I really wanted to like the menthol on blue because I've heard some good things about it mostly negative but I've heard some good things about the menthol I wanted to like it I don't I'm gonna give the menthol flavour a three out of ten it's not a great flavor all right next we're gonna go ahead and try is going to be pipe tobacco or just a regular tobacco flavor I'll show it to you here it says blue on there and it's got a little picture of a pipe and smoking us as H on there for high nicotine content now this one has a better vapor production but the flavor not great puppy breath definitely a lot better vapor production on that one still going in I get the taste of what should be a tobacco flavor it's still not a great tobacco flavor I'm gonna set this one aside real quick and I go ahead and pull out this edit aback Oh flavor I have and it's the same type of cartridge but it's out of a different pack when I go ahead and put in on there and just test it out and see if there's a difference at all same I really get that puppy breath flavor it's just really a bitter aftertaste and I'm really trying guys I'm trying to give them the benefit of the doubt and as much money as they put into it you'd think that they would be a little bit better of a product I'm not feeling that product I'm not getting it putting all my biased crap aside the flavors are not that great except for the next one the next one is a good flavor but this one the menthol and the tobacco they're not great flavors the menthol not bad going in puppy breath coming out horrible bitter aftertaste the tobacco flavor it's kind of sharp and bitter going in and puppy breath and sticky coming back out and not a great flavor at all I'll give the vapor production on this one a 7 out of 10 I'm the tobacco one it's definitely got a better better vapor production than the menthol its menthol really weak vapor production and flavor tasting aroma on the tobacco one I'm gonna give it a four I want to like it I wanted it to be better it's just it's not hitting a spot now this one is a good flavor this one I do like and I'll show it to you right now this one is actually a cherry flavor now the cherry to me tastes like we get the the cherry pie filling and you're making a cherry pie or cherry Colburn to use that cherry pie filling it tastes like the cherries that are in that kind like a cordial cherry and a heavy like a heavy sauce a heavy like like sugar sauce or sauce it's not sauce is it a sauce maybe it's a sauce it's got a good flavor and good vapor production as well the cherry I do like the cherry so if you're gonna get a blue and you want to get a blue and I'm not discouraging you from doing it I'm just saying the flavors are just not not that great there are so many mother other so many other better options out there easy smokes there's play vapor there's vapor lights I mean god there's so many you know Green Smoke there's so many different better alternatives to blue but if you're gonna do get a blue because because the convenience they're easy to get they're freaking everywhere every convenience store every grocery store of a gas station I've been to has blue so you can get blue anywhere they are expensive but get cherry avoid the menthol avoid the tobacco flavors just go with the cherry flavor and the cherry flavor it's good but I'm still only gonna give it a 7 out of 10 I've had better flavors ICI smokes has Cherry Bomb much better flavor than this cherry I had this one it's just I'm trying to put all my biases I guys I really am it's just it's just the flavors are just honestly not that good they're not a good flavor if it was good I would tell you it's good the cherry is is decent it's good it's not great it doesn't blow me away it's not $40 good it's not when you can go get a smoke starter kit for 24 bucks versus 40 bucks for this and you get the same stuff and ICI smokes instead there other companies have products like this out there which is really really handy as well because I can actually take a unit like this and I can chart do the same thing I charge up the case and then I put my screw my e-cig into the battery into this close it back up closed up I can charge my battery on the go same principle as this and half the price you can get one of these for what 15 bucks plus a cartridge so you're looking at 35 bucks you say five bucks and you have a better looking case that is a solid little case perfect versus this which another problem you know especially when you load it up you get three different cartridges in there and they put a few cartridges back in here let me show you this rattles like crazy none anyway like I said it's it's alright it's a decent product they're everywhere they're available you know a lot of places where you don't have access or you can't order them online you can pick up blue you can pick up enjoy I've heard a lot better things about enjoy then I have blue views I've tried one yeah it was bad news it was not good at all but I've only tried the one who was a very high very high nicotine content it was horrible anyway blue starter kit with other stuff be careful with the court if you get one it feels really fragile I can feel like I can just do that and pull it apart it just feels really really fragile um the kid it's alright it's a decent kit two rechargeable pack you know I've seen them if yours has one like that I think I don't know there's a couple other places that have rechargeable kits like this radda radda radda I hate that my pocket arse into my cup holder rattling all day anyway um yeah so blue the overall kit five and a half out of ten six out of ten the rechargeable case is kind of cool I don't think it's all it's cracked up to be there are so many other better options out there than blue so that's my personal opinion take it with you how you will but yeah I can't get past the puppy breath flavor and that bitter aftertaste even the cherry flavor has a little aftertaste that kind of has that little similar and I don't know if they're using dye settle in their stuff that kids that aftertaste like that or not or what the chemical is it's not a great flavor so anyway my honest opinion that's all I know so check out all my other links are not going on down below if you want a good starter kit go with easy smokes guys if you wanna play vapors got some really nice ones there's a lot of good vendors out there that you know that are that have good quality merchandise avoid blue avoid views and avoid enjoy go with the real deal get the real ones and support the smaller smaller ecig companies and help them out versus these guys don't help them out I help them out I help those guys out enough on this end I don't need to help them out on this end as well so alright guys check out all my other links catch you guys on the next review stay charged and Bape on", "JgpxHd5ZY2Y": "hey it's Katie I just wanted to do another quick video on v2 cigs red flavor this is one of the most popular tobacco flavor for ecigs and I can see why I've been vaping almost two years and I tend to stick with like dessert or mint flavors but for a straight-up tobacco v2 red has to be in one of my top favorites for those of you who smoke Marlboro Reds this is pretty much identical I think v2 does offer it in prefilled cartomizers or a liquid and these have a hard plastic tip on them which you can pop off actually when I grab my paper clip and also a little like plastic doughnut in there but there you go there's your cotton filter which you can refill let me show you one thing I like about v2 red as well is this bottle how many it's 25 milliliters but it's like really nice quality it's got a childproof cap so you got to push down on it to open but also look at like this eyedropper it's really cool and it's angled to fit right in your cartomizer refilling could not be easier with v2 so just make sure I don't drip this anywhere else so you just like one drip this is how I usually do it maybe another and then three just so you don't want to over soak that a cartomizer filter but just enough so it doesn't look drying anymore you can always add more then you just pop this back in and you're ready to go let's give it a try it's very very good very smooth and really it tastes just like my were red", "m2pBeEVWVrc": "hey you what's going on everybody it's me tan box from blood back for another review today we have a juice to review for you guys before we get into that a few videos back like pretty far back I think was like my french dude review or something I give a shout out to my friend skull Lord of apes a little while ago he moved to a new channel I believe he recently found out that he is about to have a child so that's pretty awesome so he moved to a new channel and now uses the screen name crazy clown babes so make sure you guys make him feel welcome he doesn't have a whole lot of videos up there yet but I expect a few more videos to come especially with all the stuff happening right now how he doesn't have a lot of time to make some videos but I'm sure he will soon so go ahead I will put a link to the in the description to his new channel make sure you check them out subscribe to him and tell him congratulations cuz he's having a kid so shout out to you crazy clown babes now let's get into the review the juice that we're viewing today is by glass glass is a pretty popular company that I've not reviewed any of their juices yet but today I'll be reviewing their blueberry cake flavor so first thing that you guys noticed there is a lot going on on this box it's a little hard to look at but when you look at it I kind of like it I like because it tells you everything you need to know it tells you your profile right here so this is vanilla blueberry cream cake and then it says it right there without pictures made in the USA it's yes it's a unicorn bottle three milligrams nicotine 60 mils 70/30 PG VG ratio flavor flavor profiles over here and then you have vapor production you have flavor strengths and then you have a throat hit so it tells you everything you need to know this is off their basics line if you look up top it says all this stuff and then basic spyglass I don't know why it says buttercream I don't know why it says sugar glaze but it sounds like dessert fruit that kind of makes sense so that's pretty cool and this is a 60 milliliter bottle cost me $16 that's pretty awesome I get 30 mils more expensive than that so $16 for a 60 mil is super cool so let's let's give it a try I have already been baking it I got it yesterday so I've been vaping it for less than 24 hours got it loaded up and I'll do all that so you open up the box bottle sitting right here one thing I don't really like is that it's a little difficult to get out at first I of course managed to get it out already it has pretty much the same exact thing on the bottle I think it again it I think it looks pretty cool to other people it might be just a lot going on and it is but I like it I like the way that this looks gives you all your information in case for some reason you ever forget man it's got your batch number up there your expiration date for some reason and yeah let's let's get into it let's take small strong notes of blueberry definitely definitely kind of like a cake or a pastry definitely not like a super fresh blueberry for like a fresh-baked blueberry no vanilla yet let's do a finger test sweet tasty definitely very good blueberry again it's not not like a super fresh blueberry but it's a like a bakery blueberry um small hint of vanilla I'm tasting the small hint of vanilla in the back part of my throat not so much creaminess but definitely more of a vanilla vanilla and regular cream kinda tastes similar to me in my opinion yeah let's uh let's take a bait so today we have this loaded up in the Medusa our TTA I've had this for a few months I'm loving it still as you can see I put an 8/10 rip I put in my copies can 810 drip tip on there it's not supposed to fit cuz the Medusa is 710 but it just barely barely fits I left the 710 in my car and I don't feel like I'm going to get it so I made do with this it's not gonna affect the flavor or anything it's fitting pretty well on there right now freshly cleaned coils regular clapton coils reading a point one six we're gonna refill this this is what the cotton looks like I did not put that looking back now I didn't put a whole lot of cotton in it so it's kind of darkening up pretty quick but trust me it's not really gunking it up I have I've had no signs of gunking yet I hear these are not supposed to really go cup your coils that much everything looks nice and saturated nothing sticky your gunky flavor is still fantastic so if that changes at all that you know but besides a little bit of darkening in the cotton we're we're pretty good alright so we're gonna start point one six seventy seven and a half watts let's see how it vapes blueberry cake white glass ah that spit right onto my arm wow that was painful little harsh in the back your throat which is weird is the flavor the sorry the throat his as a 1-star if I had to read it myself I'd personally say to like two and a half stars maybe three it's not like a nicotine kick in the back your throat it's not like a flavor harshness in the back of your throat I think I flooded it still getting of course from getting blueberry obviously it's a sweet blueberry I'm getting butteriness of cake not like butteriness of any kind of butter but butteriness of a cake like a fresh cake it doesn't taste so much like a blueberry cake as it does blueberry and then cake separate notes separate notes but together but now what is super mild but I am tasting it right in the middle part of my tongue I guess I get a little bit of cream a little bit of cream I'm gonna back most part of my tongue so far it's super enjoyable let's do retrouvaille now I must say super clean super flavorful super smooth um but yeah it's uh definitely sweet leaving a good sweetness on your tongue enough sweetness lingers around for a little bit yeah super good let's just let's just move on the ratings let's write the body which thick bottle has already said it's supposed to be a 5 star vapor production so let's test it seventy seven and a half watts 0.16 they are correct I wouldn't say it's a five star body but the body is great the body is great huge blooming white perfect I mean I don't have a very good lung capacity but um for what it is it's a very good body amazing nine and a half at a time buddy we'll definitely get a ten out of ten for what it is let's check the retro he'll go okay the travail is super super clean delicious I'm tasting mostly blueberries and cream on the retro hill and the fact that I'm tasting it is awesome it's a huge plus I'm tasting it a lot super tasty aren't you hey I bet your Hill is gonna get a 9 and a half just because I'm not tasting all the notes but great great flavor on there at your hey let's do overall flavor around the review my thoughts on this juice um looking back it does taste a little bit like blueberry lemon cake it's got those two main notes of blueberry and cake similar tasting blueberry similar tasting cake obviously no lemon in this one instead of two places vanilla and cream and besides them being quite quite quite similar this flavor does could definitely stay on its own the vanilla the blueberry the cream the cake are also delicious if they came out with one cleaver for each like a blueberry flavor of vanilla flavor cream flavor cake flavor I would try each one of those Nate I'm betting they would all be absolutely delicious as is this juice they are fantastic together and this juice is definitely a huge win I am super disappointed that I never have not tried any flavors by a glass before I mean I'm sure I've sampled some but I've never bought a flavor by glass before and I'm definitely I have to start buying more than because the flavor knocks it right out of the park it's fantastic I'm gonna go ahead and give glasses blueberry cake flavor a solid nine and a half out of ten again the only reason I'm very very very picky with giving juices at you 10/10 I believe that all the views I've done I've given maybe one possibly two flavors of ten out of ten this flavor is delicious it is fantastic I just wish I taste it's a more a little bit more vanilla I mean I don't want it to be overpowering because vanilla by itself is normally very overpowering but I will it to taste a little bit more creamy blueberry like berries and cream are my favorite flavors I love lure I love I love them starting to love cake flavors - I do wish there was a little bit more of a cream flavor in this but the stooge is definitely great enough by itself to receive in that and a half at a time alright
