date any time I upload a video if not welcome on back in this video today as you can see by the title I am going to be smoking my very first pre-roll now don't get me wrong these are the pre rolls that I have don't get me wrong I have something pretty well before but I personally have never owned one like I've never hey let me go get a pre-roll let me go cough a pre-roll you got rules no I'm not doing that I've always had trust issues with pre rules but I don't know what's really inside of it and I don't know who ruled it yeah so I got my two free pre-rolls last night at I aim weed pop-up shop if anybody doesn't know or if anybody lives in New York hit me up cuz homegirl got connections they're always underground we'd pop-up events that happen and it's basically a party where you could just go shop for [ __ ] weed you know you get all the exotic things that you've never heard for and never like really get around your neighborhood things of that nature you get to get that you get to get edibles food good music like accessories things of that nature like I got this rolling train oh it's all dirty I had this rolling train from one of the events that I did go to so yeah so I have to here I got this from the entry as you can see it's a little loose they were kind of being whatever and then I got this with the purchase of the bud that I've got from a table so I've already smoked the bud that it's already enrolled in this one and this is a mystery weed so hopefully all those will lighten refocus let's party let's party let's party my god I'm so yellow okay there we go a spark joy oh this is cute they even did a little a perfect em can we get that and focus I can't I can't get it in focus there's a perfect um there's a little piece of weed at the bottom but I like who did this voltar [Music] okay this is smoking good this is tasting good so far is good but um last night I'm at a good time going to the event kind of sad that I should go by myself actually a couple my friends my friends like mean I don't want to go me I'm me I'm like [ __ ] I'm going so I went I got me a couple Apes as I told you or we got me two free pre rolls and I got edibles so I'm going to edible first these are there you like these are the thickest edibles I've seen like and I got three for 25 I ate half of one last night yeah quick story so when I went to go buy the edibles last night at the table the couple that was there was nice enough to let me try their THC infused food so they had rice and like a car you chicken I'm not going to pass up free food so I thank you very much so that [ __ ] was my hit spot I'm gonna just say that it is by tasting wise it didn't taste that great but it sure enough got me smacked I give him that so moving on to the fuzz they don't die I got three different bugs as you can see I got two from the same table present both wicked green and then one from a different table boom so I got sugar cookie purple pie and apple fritters I'm gonna insert a video clip of it Oh sugar cookie was definitely a fan favorite of the ladies last night so that's why the vendor recommended it to me and that's what's in the second panel oh yeah it's really sweet smelling like it smells legit like sugar like candy and then we have purple piper if I definitely cooked my I personally pissed I like her I don't know why it's just so pretty so you got the purple part yeah then we got the apple fritter the apple fritter smells the best the best so sugar cookie was definitely a fan favorite profile looks the best and Apple Twitter smells all of them so also the positive thing that happened to me last night at this event was when I went to get the sugar cookie and purple I was only gonna get one I was only gonna get the purple pie but then the guy told me about shooting you something since you mentioned before I deal at your table was like two for something why they bother he's like I can't do two 460 I'm like okay cool so I got an eighth for $10 less just to get another one with a free I feel like a good deal because rather than spend 80 for two days I got anymore and a free pre-roll whoa sounds have you with that kind of made up for the fact that I went by myself but I did the most novice mood ever I didn't have any problem when I waited I don't know what happened like I swear to fall I had papers in my bag or whatever but I had nothing I didn't have papers I had fun so I didn't have a rep I didn't have nothing so as soon as your girl got there you already know I went scavenger mole I would like so where is the photo they pointed me to a table phantom blow me some paan so I kept it push it I found somebody I was rolling up I'm like I gotta look for somebody smoking not finishing like just starting to smoke or like rolling up at this moment so I was just looking around scavenger room and I found somebody I was like [Music] - oh so I got some papers I like I bet got my phone so got my papers I started to check my pocket no lighter mind you I went to this event right after work so I was so eager to smoke you didn't even know how to smoke I was I was like I've got this I'm on it I'm about to smoke about to have some good weed in my system I ain't never had before oh boo boo nah nothing so I'm so glad I'm part of the stoner community as we're stoners are very nice I asked the couple even though I've kind of felt bad that I was kind of like raining on their blue loving parades this is it we're definitely going back on and I had to ask them for you know a lighter they sure know tells me and homegirl huh huh and then we'll make up [Music] yes I did all in all I could have a good time and I wasn't upset about going by myself after the fact that I walked in the door I was mad walking there I was like oh yeah I'd make a stun pull my friends suck I went on with friends yeah it's like um I always want to blow me off of whatever [ __ ] them well no not [ __ ] them but bump them forget about them they want to have fun let them have fun and let me have my fun too but yeah yeah hope you guys didn't write this whole video about me going to the Vida vent last night and seeing some brand new bud that I got going on and I definitely enjoy this pre-roll because I [Music] have no idea what kind of but it is it was cute it was cute if you like this video thumbs it up if you really liked it comment down below other than that peace and love say hi you guys [Music]", "FYfewG91Bos": "i'm gonna be making a video on the one gram jeter p rule the strain is gonna be blue skittles let's get straight to it mate um we out here in my pad man i think it's my first time maybe not my first time whoa [ __ ] maybe not my first time but like one of my only videos out here in the backyard um in the day um i'm always making my videos at night because uh [ __ ] just because um i don't film it for my parents you feel me or not just like my parents with my fam i don't like filming it from i don't like filming in front of them it just feels weird [ __ ] there's too much light over here so yeah man like i said we're going to be smoking on the blue skittles by jeter i've had these periods before if you guys have not seen my 2 gram jeter video make sure to go check it out posted it maybe three months ago if you're watching this video where i wanted to upload it but this is the one grammar this is gonna be my first time facing uh the one gram jeter i've never smoked one to the face every time i smoked the jeter i split it with somebody the two gram i split it with my homie lorenzo and then i remember my homie bliss me out with one of these the one gram they actually had me lit two and today sunday friday uh we bought a two grand pre-roll and we split it between three of us still got high as [ __ ] so i'm curious to see how high i'm going to get with this one gram facing it to the dome so blue skittles if i remember correctly is going to be a cross of blue diamond and skittles this is going to be an indica strain this particular one is going to be testing at 30.65 thc zero percent cbd this was manufactured september 22nd 2020 today is i think august i'm in august [ __ ] um october 16th the burn time for this is i think five minutes about 10 minutes yeah you can see right there burning time 10 minutes um yeah man these [ __ ] pre-rolls highly [ __ ] recommend them let me know how much you guys get them i'm not sure if i said it but i got this for 15 out the door i think it was like 10 12 bucks before tax i get the one gram for 16 to 2 grand for 25 and the five pack for 32 or like 31. you just got to peel the plastic right here on the sides and have the um cut out if you want to peel that off pull plastic comes off push down and by the way this is not going to be glass this is um this is all plastic everything on here is plastic it's going to come sealed up just want to lift it up oh that smells weird all right y'all this is what the pre-roll is looking like like i'm guessing they brush it down with some oil and then rolled it in keith i think this is maybe like a point point eight of some flour point one of some wax point one or some keith maybe i don't know but let's go ahead and spark this up see how it's tasting see how it's smoking all right y'all came to the front yard because there was too much noise in the back the [ __ ] uh pump was going on just kidding i didn't want to be screaming and [ __ ] oscar what's up dog i don't know if this is a good angle or not but i'll go ahead and spark this up and uh get my first thoughts on this blue skittles never tried this strand before taste how it smells one thing i really [ __ ] like about these pre-rolls too is they never ever at least i've never smoked one that burns uneven always burning even as [ __ ] dude that's like better than my [ __ ] joints also you're gonna be crying sniffly and coughing like every [ __ ] hit i don't know if you guys can tell on camera but in person bro this [ __ ] chucks [ __ ] clouds dude throws hell of [ __ ] smoke she looks like you're [ __ ] vaping one sip of milk tastes all right all right i'm about to finish this piro i had recorded the video but it came out backwards like it was upside down so i'm just do this again um i'm hot as [ __ ] dude this is a one grand pro my first time facing this [ __ ] i'm pretty [ __ ] lit um i'll give this [ __ ] like a nine out of ten the only reason i'm gonna give it like a nine out of ten because i don't really focus this flavor i recommend a lot of the gelato 33 and i recommend the strawberry shortcake those two are gas um the thurber poison is also really [ __ ] good but yeah man i don't know i thought this flavor was going to be cool but it was cool it's not bad for me this is not what i thought it was going to be um but yeah bro i'm going to give this [ __ ] like a 9 out of 10 bro it's just perfect high swell i paid 25 bucks for this if i had to but you know yeah uh definitely recommend it if you guys haven't tried it for sure try this [ __ ] uh you guys are thinking about it man get this and if you guys have had it let me know what you guys think about them and uh that's a beautiful video y'all hope y'all enjoyed the video hope that time soon hope y'all listen and catch on there for me peace okay bye", "NtvXdVx61l8": "[Music] good morning fam uh uh yes sir she got her back broken you know we be breaking backs we be breaking spines not literally figuratively okay so we put the [ __ ] in wheelchairs anyways fam what's happening how are you doing this morning so uh it's basically sunday morning and uh i'm gonna wake and bake right so i figured why not wake and bake and uh review what i'm gonna smoke on you know what i mean so uh basically gonna review this golani all right so i smoke these golanis all the time they're really good they're covered in keef some of them have hash in them um they're really really nice rolls you guys can go ahead and follow them on instagram it's hard to see um but their instagram is basically uh golani rolls so you can look them up anyways the reason why i want to uh make a review on this one is because this one's a menthol mint mint uh [Music] joint you know what i mean and i've never had i've never been a fan of menthol you know growing up as a teenager you know smoking cigarettes or whatever i tried menthol cigarettes i hated them so ever since then i've never really thought of wanting to smoke menthol at at all right so [Music] so i want to get the flavor going of the regular bud that i'm used to smoking you know it's usually indica and uh get a feel for what that goal lining tastes like all right so so now i just got a little bit of that sour diesel i've got that weed taste in my mouth right or that smoked taste that smoked taste i like the wheat taste i like so uh let's go ahead and open this thing all right so like i said these guys come in different flavors they've got banana blueberry apple um and they're all good i just have not made a review on them but now as i start getting them i'll start reviewing them so they do come in a nice glass jar so it's kind of nice um these usually run about 14 dollars maybe fifteen dollars but if you spend enough they let you get them at half price so as you can see it's completely covered in keith all right so basically uh cool mint roll handcrafted raw paper we got sativa 30 indica 70 percent it's the gold lining all right so menthol flavor i don't know what do you guys think this thing's gonna taste like it smells really good it kind of smells like chocolate mint it definitely has a mint flavor to it so i don't know if i'm going to like it let's test it out that new guna album so let's get this waking bait going right [Music] i wonder if it's gonna have that strong menthol taste [Music] now taste that again [Music] has the slightest hit slightest hint of mint but it's just enough [Music] it's just enough to uh it's not overpowering i actually kind of like it [Music] it's pretty nice and even right let me move the angle where i'm sitting a little further anyways fam so far the smoke tastes good this burning real smooth it does have that chocolate mint taste i actually like it [Music] so good tastes like i'm eating chocolate mint candy in a good way i'm not a fan of chocolate mint [Music] no i may have a little bit you know sometimes at the restaurants when you leave there's that uh little chocolate mint you can have i may have one like i said i'm not a big fan but [Music] this thing's burning smooth sunday morning waking big [Music] so like i said i'm already a fan of the golanis always have been they burn smooth they taste good man that gunner goes hard let's get another one going you know but uh that wake and bake i love it i love waking up taking a snapper or usually if i end up hitting the blunt the blunt might [ __ ] me up too hard but these uh golanis they also have their you know their sativa line i'll pick up another one today and uh give the old give it the old review i'm a fan of them i have nothing bad to say about this golani tastes good got some fire flower in there [Music] that keep is rocking you know oh try and smoke this [Music] try and take it to the head you know what i mean [Music] so [Music] so it's definitely a brand i like [Music] this one isn't my favorite it's got the slightest hint of mint but it's still fire it's still good you know what i mean i'm still getting liddy [Music] let me ask this thing [Music] it won't ash it won't fall off [Music] so they do have their line where they've got the keefe on it and they also throw the moon rocks in it you know what i mean so nothing bad to say at all about this golani i really like it [Music] starting to burn a little uneven but not a big deal [Music] heyo fam [Music] you guys roll a trifecta yet um no one's no one's ruled a trifecta videoed it and sent it to me so my next post i'm gonna put the directions on the trifecta and how we roll that and my trifecta is basically you know some good flour rolled in a swisher with a few different uh extracts in there you know what i mean like some moon rocks crumble [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh man it's starting to get to me so again this definitely got that menthol taste now that i'm almost done with it [Music] you know so you guys come across these i like them they definitely got they definitely got my stamp on it because the products good you know what i mean these are easy like for grab and go you know what i mean if you don't have time to roll some fire up put all the keef in there put all the uh moon rock in there put all the shatter in there that's why i like these because these are easy grab and go you know what i mean you can pick up a few and uh put them in your bag and just get going wherever you're going because this isn't just any ordinary mess this is called a scratch-off map but if you have to guess how [Music] you get the little beat going almost done with it [Music] we're going to take it to the bone you know what i mean [Music] all right fam so again this is basically a review on the golani [Music] mint flavor like i said they have a bunch of different flavors banana strawberry pineapple so i'll make sure to write a review or do a review on all the flavors so this menthol one or mint not my favorite but it was okay would i buy it again not this one it's the only one i'll probably avoid so so anyways bam hope you guys have a happy sunday let's stay lifted please like and subscribe and

think that's how it is but all right guys cheers i don't know what is it it tastes like it's not already it's supposed to be it's kind of hard to pull especially pre-roll's always hard to pull i always have to end so small like that yeah i know the thing's kind of [ __ ] up right there [Music] okay dude so he gets smoked slow hmm for a one penny joint i guess you can't say it's bad because

really taste like it apparently he says so trim this could be the trim that would be bogus as [ __ ] still getting ready i rate this joint out of 10 a rated of six 5.5 i'm going with the six only because it was a penny i would never spend twenty dollars on this pre-roll the dispensary it's been pretty good you know going there i would say it could be a little bit better if they can carry some

it's hawaii heartbreak free roll by riff so let's shuffle this up and give it a spin and collect this pre-roll oh my god what a surprise it's riff white heartbreak pre-roll [Applause] so here's riff hawaii heartbreak pre-roll um at uh what what percent is this 17 oh yeah 17.87 percent or 178.77 milligrams thc and what size is this one by one g so this is a one gram um pre-roll apparently i guess uh what's the package date here is there one oh yeah there's one january 28 2020. so there we go yep one times one gram dried cannabis pre-roll yeah i've never tried one of these before i don't smoke cannabis anymore i use vaporizers now i get a couple vaporizers but um yeah i thought it'd be interesting just to check this out because i used to love rolling dubs used to roll tons of dubs but now anyways um i was just curious i was always wondering a friend gave this to me so i thought you know what i'm just gonna save for uh opening up with you guys and we'll check it out together here so yeah and we can weigh it too we can check all kinds of things out all right so it comes in a little tube here which is then also wrapped in plastic so even more garbage let's see what do we got inside here uh open up oh you gotta press what squeeze below cap oh my goodness look at that hey look in there there it is it's hiding there we go you know that seems like an all right roll this is a fucking huge filter though oh shit that's a massive filter uh when i used to roll like when where i'm from we roll joints like your filter you built like that that amount of space maybe even like that don't go like that or like this but anyways oh that smells real nice wow mmm that smells really nice that does smell nice my my let's check the scale this is supposed to be one gram and i'm assuming they're not counting the paper and the filter that would suck if they were cuz someone you want here's a 50.00 gram weight we're checking nice and accurate there so see how much does the whole thing weigh hey 1.34 that's uh good one point that's good good okay well there we go now i'm not gonna smoke this but you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna bust it open we're gonna take a look at what the hell they put inside of here because i was always wondering what does the quality of the stuff in here look like i know it smells nice so i have my uh my little bowl here it's all calibrated it's zeroed out so i think maybe we'll just tear the paper and i'll dump it into here and we can check the uh the weight right yes here it goes come on riff hey hey slightly over that's all right that's a good sign that's what you want now let's see look how it's broken up there looks like a nice grind looks decent let's check it out with the microscope i guess i don't know there's the pre-roll the inside of the pre-roll it seemed like a good roll you actually did so it's cool okay we've got to zoom in here with um a microscope check it in oh hey right there that so here we are checking it out up close with the microscope everything's all ground up here oh a little bit of purple looks like got a purple section um yeah lots of trichomes they're the kind of chunky ones there where there's a bunch of like little clusters of cloudy trichomes that's for um quality the stuff inside you know you can't really tell all that much from stuff that's ground up right because it's it's hard to tell i can definitely see chunks of trichomes though they got the big chunky kind there it reminds me a bit of the stuff you see on like a lot of the ultra sour they got the same sort of colors usually whoa oh oh oh oh what did we find we found something what is this looks like a string some kind of thread i'm not talking about the pink thing there i'm talking about the blue thing right in the center do you see that a little microfiber there a little microfiber see look at that we zoomed right in on it you can see it there it is little piece of some shit there some sort of thing a string maybe thread i don't know anyways though i suppose it's not so bad if you find just one anyways you know what best way to tell with this because it's all busted up i gotta go try this in the vaporizer so i'll be back so i just got in from this uh riff hawaii heartbreak pre-roll that i busted up and vaped some of it's a one gram pre-roll um yeah it's good stuff i like it i don't think i liked it this much the last time i got hawaii heartbreak i actually do like it it's um it's a nice kind of let's see where would i put this maybe somewhere maybe a step up from medium but not not at the top you know what i mean so it's pretty good the taste is um i i don't know how to describe this taste there is nice flavor here though i don't know how to describe it i guess you could say the taste is kind of like well it reminds me a bit of like dirt but like the cleanest dirt i've ever tasted so clean if i can taste remnants of the cleaning products that was used to clean it i don't know if that makes sense but that's kind of a feeling i get from the taste i like it though it's not a bad thing it's a good way though it's like the good version of that taste and uh i like it it's very nice so obviously i didn't go out for the entire thing right because if you buy this this comes as a whole gram right so i could probably go for let's see here i could probably do two and at least two more bowls in the packs on this so if you were to buy this this would definitely get you pretty cooked i would say because you probably even smoked the whole thing right um but you know when i go out i always fill up every single time just so i have like a standard i always use one bowl in the packs i fill it right up or whatever so that way each time i'm always testing the exact same amount and that way it's kind of like a standard so i can sort of compare things so yeah this is good stuff i like it very nice um i was better than i was expecting which is cool so yeah so is it worth the price though i don't know that's kind of that's kind of where i don't know because you can buy one gram of this on its own for ten dollars and this is like just under 13. sorry it's just over 12 12 28 so 12 28 versus 10 10 and so that's like two dollars and eighteen cents for them to roll it so that's like you're standing there you buy weed then you give someone two dollars and eighteen cents to roll and then they give it to you and take it so that's really what you're paying for i guess but this is um this is good stuff this makes me like hawaii heartbreak more so i might i might try another of those sometime i don't know who knows anyways that's it for the uh disc of dankness so i have no idea what's coming up next i guess we'll see anyways if you also want to see hit the subscribe button and um click on the bell and then it'll tell you when the next video comes up because there is more coming i just don't know what to do yet but i do have some more stuff so anyways have a good one you guys we'll see you later", "mdqV728E-ug": "[Music] what's up pop peeps in sugar I'll pop mine for 20 and we are back for another product review video before we get started popping so let's do our little thing that we call SML we need you to subscribe and while you're there I need you to hit that notification bell and also just like me because I'm pop mom and you guys already love me anyway so make sure you're going in that love but Ananya to guys today I know have been one like a total hiatus but maybe about a week or two now just because of the holiday break so I appreciate you guys hanging in there making sure you go to my videos as soon as they drop on leave Wednesdays I appreciate it I came back with something bigger this week guys I have Peck woods not to be confused with back woods this is tactless this is packwood's dot la is out of Los Angeles and I am so excited so be the proud owner of three of them I have all three pack words from LA they're now at planted 13 so you can get packwood's in nevada now at planted 13 so shout out to shot planted 13 that always hook me up with the latest that comes out I got all of these and Nevada from them they have an exclusive one called alien og so I'm excited I have all three so what I want to do today is just do a simple product review with you guys I will include all the links to Packwood's la comm so you guys can go in a site find out with new strands that they're coming up with but I'm just excited about the company so what they have done is infused rolling papers that look like blood papers and they're not they're a handmade hemp wrap paper that they put a vein into it to make it look like it was like an actual plant wrapper this guy's is special because they did three different infuse menteur this they have a concentrate in it they have a premium flower and then on outside they dust it with Keith so I don't even know how strong this is gonna be I don't I don't know how many puffs I'm gonna be able to get all I know is I'm gonna be a little out so I don't want you to judge me but we're gonna get into this I have three brands here this one is the alien OG hopefully you can see that this one is exclusive to Planet 13 once again shout out to them they are sold out maybe out of this one you guys have to call them and see this one is called GABA and this is a hybrid so is the alien og so both of these are hyper some remember hybrids want to keep you nice in the middle that way you can feel the head body high but not too high now this one the purple one is called purple punch and this one is an indica so today I'm not going to smoke Invicta I'm also not gonna smoke this particular hybrid Agathe I'm gonna go for the alien og because I am an alien and I want to get a shot off the plane 213 because this one was exclusive you might not see this one on the market I'm not sure so I wanted to kind of give my review to them as well what I thought of the one they made just for planting 13 customers so we're gonna get into this I'm gonna remove these two to the side so first of all I'm going to just talk about the packaging because you my peeps know when I do a product review I go there I go all the way there first of all I love that this can't break I do know they're going for $60 at the shop so they have $60 here in Nevada we can look up and see what they're going for Vegas but this is $60 so for $60 to Graham would concentrate premium flower and they keep one outside that does an amazing deal and I love that you can't break anything so you don't have to silver fragile because I mean your product is fragile but I love the date took the time to kind of like really design it where it's eye-catching as well and even if you see it inside of this place like it's playing 13 they have done the displays so beautifully so shout out to the pack was marketing team in LA y'all did that it also kind of reminds me in a weird way of a Kylie lipstick if y'all agree with me pop peeps just tell me that in the comment it really does it has that whole trippin thing on the side so this is really a good packaging I I'm impressed with packaging didn't even think that so you just roll it off it's a roll and I hope my camera can get to this so let me come up I want you guys to really see that when you first pull it out and you can really smell it the scent on this is I just love the smell okay so if you can see them holding my hand up you can see the key fits nicely dusted on it outside this part of it is a glass tip so it's gonna allow you to like kind of burn it evenly so you get a nice draw every time you pull that's what the glass tip is supposed to doing this is a nice sized glass citize I would say that's a couple of inches I don't know if you can see that real close up but that's like a two inch glass that's really nice to me it feels like if you had a mini cigar in a way so I kind of I love the feel of it it's nothing to it but to do it we're gonna get into it anything I like that's a blunt or the palm rolls or anything like that I like to light mines with the hemp I know this is a little piece of this is hemp rope I like to light it with that that way it gives me some type of control instead of letting my lighter control everything so that's how I'm gonna do it so choose the you pot peeps shot the Packwood's LA and let's get this alien og from shot planted 13 let's I like to inhale just to make sure I'm pulling everything I must say lighting getting I thought the pool would be happy they go be a lot heavier and it's not it's really smooth and I guess it has something to do with the glass tip now I can tell if you can tell I lit it wrong in here but it should have a nice even lip and because that keep us on the outside it shouldn't burn through fast that's what it shouldn't do if you find yourself in you lit it the wrong way just let it take its time and let they kind of like let it breathe and it'll evenly start to burn around so what I like is that you don't have to put the whole piece in your mouth it burns real light you can just put your mouth right on a tip just like my shirt be on the lookout for shop pop mom for 20 years oh I got that weed weird I like this a little dude not sure what premium flower I do know that the concentrate is nice and to keep this not even coming off on my hand I love that so let's talk a little more in depth about this back once I got my smoking hat on you know I've seen Rick Ross smoked this I've seen you waka flocka the baby little baby what's that other baby skittles baby I don't know one of them other babies they've all had this and now I'm hot moms at it I gotta do this I need a friend shout out to any of my papi friends that want to come share cuz I don't know if I'm gonna finish this this is this is a lot I might have this for the next couple days it's two grounds one person should have to finish this off seriously what did you say when you hi you just don't know what to say I guess you say that [ __ ] was good huh no I hate that y'all see me like this cuz I'm gonna be rolling I don't even know me get anything else doing this is too much this is probably not the

it's strong I for what a high grade us I feel like my body is just like somebody else came and took off really nice somebody named Adele a no Gina so somebody can come take over your body if you did a little G because I don't feel I don't know oh I probably wish I had a friend this year went that way I can have somebody to give me feedback and I know Papeete y'all wish to do that but you're not here right right here matter of fact you try it exactly it's like a calming effect but you just feel like hmm maybe I should take it slow like I feel like I can do things but I should probably take it slow I feel like if you were sharing with this this was someone you don't have to worry about them soggy enough to tip its glass so it's really like one stay sturdy you're not sometimes you you roll a blunt and then they get all saggy at the tip of it and you gotta pull it back together they've already solved that issue so this is a great cheerful I would suggest you buy it this holiday season

listen up here a local law enforcement agency says legally buying CBD flower can get you arrested CBD products with low THC levels are legal in Indiana but as rtv6 is Alyssa Donovan explains it all tests the same to police as marijuana Greenfield police have a warning for people who use CBD flower after this shop owner came forward concerned about a product on her shelves I was very upset because I felt like my business was threatened at first the owner of Indy's vape escape has been selling CBD oil for a long time recently she added this to her product line we've had a lot of requests for the CBD flower and I was hesitant about bringing it in because the looks of it but she did some research and brought two different kinds into her store after a few weeks she was still uneasy she asked a friend from the Greenfield Police Department to take a look at the flowers where we conducted some initial tests on this similar to what we would do on the street if an officer were to encounter a green leafy substance on an individual during this a traffic stop or whatever the product tested positive our field test kit for marijuana these test kits show if a product contains cannabinoids or CBD if it does it tests positive for marijuana now what our tests can't show is our we can't prove or we can't come up with verify what the actual THC level is in these products THC is the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana in Indiana CBD products can legally contain up to 0.3 percent of THC but since the test does not show these levels it simply appears positive as marijuana those products tested by police were labeled as having a point 3 percent THC level as law enforcement we want to make sure that we are not targeting people are making people that do not have criminal intent criminals simultaneously we want to make sure we effectuate the law it was intended by the legislature in the governor when was passed that's why Greenfield police is warning the public by CBD

your body in there and you hold the button and it will grind up or you wait for you and then put it in your bowl etc yeah but it is very good electric gonna put in one of the best on the market yeah what is the last one happy and it is some weigh scales perfect so this is 0.001 scales so you can wear a pod and work very very well but anyways hope you enjoyed this video guys doubloons yeah

you guys some information i got this from um pcf it's dispensary around here in the 209 in the valley in california um i got this 14 out the door and i've been seeing a lot of comments on my other videos from my cartridges specifically uh just because i get them for so cheap out the door from the dispensary it's not just me like i'm not cabin you know you could go to the comments this is these dispensaries they're known around my my area like for being really [ __ ] cheap um alien labs the eggs they used to be 52 out the door but they recently bumped it up to 72 out the door so basically just like any other area now um but we do got like marathon g for like 52 out the door we got a corova for 29 out the door um a lot of cure come just the marathon of g just because it's like nipsey's weed rip nipsey man but uh it's not that good bro 52 bucks that's the only reason they made this [ __ ] 52 bucks it wasn't for that all the other care company aids their um 29 out the door and the indoors 25 out the door the light depth which is greenhouse 20 out the door outdoor 15. i'll make a video on on um on the dispensaries i go to so whoever cares about them um you know you guys could watch them anyways i got this 14 out the door okay but anyways i got this 14 out the door um i already tried one it was a scherbassia one that my homie jober got shadow joker we split it between three heads got me pretty lit so i'm kind of curious to see how lit this will get me smoking into the dome and although i think the other one was like 24 or 23 percent csg this one's only 19 tsp 19.38 and 0.04 cbd it was manufactured 51120 and package 60220 um and yeah that's it so one grand p roll uh let me know how much you guys get this for out the door where you guys are from i paid 14 out the door and let's get to it man oh so honestly i was telling my homie i was like um i was like bruh hella dumb the alien labs ace now go for 72. you just get three of these [ __ ] for like what 36 bucks you know fourteen dollars each 40 bucks whatever you know get yourself an eighth right there and three three p rules but uh all right let's open this [ __ ] see what the [ __ ] is about i'm already smoked like i said i already smoked it so i know it's good but um just give us a little little review and also crack the seal crack the seal [ __ ] sings bait that [ __ ] pisses me off bro cause i spend my hard work my hard-earned money on this [ __ ] just a [ __ ] just from [ __ ] i call it fake bro hmm [ __ ] all right mmm you see the weed pop out in labs one grand pro sick comes in raw cone like i said if you guys are if you guys been sticking on my channel you guys know what that noise means good air flow gonna start heating up your rig right now and give you some seconds part of the video if you got a car get ready to hit a [ __ ] blinker get your lungs right let's [ __ ] do this i'll turn my ac off right quick burn that x's paper off sunday i'm about to upload this video right now play some gta i was supposed to go on the hike but um there's some family [ __ ] going on right now so just rather be home you know just in case bro wear your [ __ ] mask she's not a joke two people in my family already got that [ __ ] so i'll stop playing around with that [ __ ] bro way different so i mean not that the shabbat show was bad and it was [ __ ] amazing this is amazing too not that this one's bad either it's just good to know that they got the [ __ ] together they really care you know making sure it tastes different oh you can see that rosin ring already look at that it's gas bro already the taste for a gelato gelato is a safe bet you know you want to get a wheatie never try you want to try a wheat bread you never tried before and if they have a lot to get the gelato it's going to be guys you go same for cards same for wax just get gelato it's always going to get you lit so it's going to taste fire that's a good thing about gelato and um this strain cross is actually uh gelato 41 hence the ariel 41 and some type of og so it's a really good mix because the gelato is there for the flavor the og is there for the high just like girl scout cookies how it's um urban poison and uh what's the other one i know it's og kush but there's like a third straight um but yeah taste [ __ ] one through ten i'll give this [ __ ] like a nine to be honest yeah that's a solid 9 out of 10 for sure for sure um the high i'll get to y'all at the end of the joint see what's see what he's talking about so i'll get to y'all when i'm about like right here about it about us turn it off and um i'll let you guys know let you guys know how i'm feeling man i'll give you my final final results but so far bro guys look at the ash though it's kind of black that could be the paper though because look the the like middle is white it could be fake raw much cones be maybe i don't know fire though i'll be back i'll be back in a bit i'll tell you guys my final thoughts so all right bruh just to give you guys an update my highest forgot my [ __ ] keys in the car [Music] no i'm not going to give it 10 out of 10 i'm gonna give it a nine just because the ash is not white and that matters when you're raising a joint but i'm being picky okay guys shit's fired if i'll give you something a nine that's almost perfect you gotta realize that like a seven is something that's like like you know that's something like you know you just smoke most of the time but once and then you'll find that unicorn and then just get you high different red so um yeah definitely [ __ ] recommend to shave you guys thinking about copying this copy it almost out of pay i'm gonna say that this is better than the [ __ ] uh cookie spiro [ __ ] that [ __ ] was 20 bucks so definitely recommend this over cookies pre-roll everything is about that everything you know about corova i recommend this over corrobor p rule i recommend this over basically a lot of heroes so i would definitely say these are my top three not number one uh pre-roll so far the alien labs period um i would recommend the scherbassio just because it's a whole different taste but if you like gelato definitely get the air before every 41. great taste um it's gonna be it man i'm live as [ __ ] put the ashtray i'll catch you on next video bruh and", "O1RhgH2C1es": "hi oh please just done couple years there in a box at the time and the pensioner diesel said well your people was good obviously a bit for today I fought I picked up this a niche boys skills pre-roll they're gonna see a little creaminess trade skills 1.5 grams nature boys all that stuff I think this major points to get always pretty role I was just going to smoke it before you know what might do something a bit different much good it just to see what's inside it you know in the spirit of like you what some of pre-roll West case we reviews on a Instagram see that minding some pretty roles and stuff seen exactly what's inside in that and I see these native boys peels and put quite a bit hard round at the moment a lot of people smoking on them like you know the business and that sort of for you know what let's cut one op see exactly what's inside it yeah it's only gonna be a short video like there wasn't quite as I can see what's inside to make sure they like stem use and often show that which I really don't think that will be you know nature would do the absolute business so I highly doubt it's gonna be anything sort [ __ ] in here but yeah let's get this a pre roll out and see exactly the same sue there is the pre-roll to start of it's a case then I'll show you as well we do have like a little glass I've wanted to be a little bit of weed in mind just unfortunate looking this being a bad stuff well yeah come to my class which obviously I'm gonna keep and reusing stuff damn certainly looks nice certainly smells nice as well really nice or skittle smoke coming up there so sweet through II sort of smell Klim yeah just a as well be is raining outside so I do apologize about that didn't hear that stuff but yeah anyway nature boys skittles pyrrole as you see you there let's get this opened up see what's inside it oh just got that cut open as you can see look all our weed there let's go certainly on Thursdays fictions it's looking at the business Google drive's anything that shouldn't be that's all the pulp order stove our classrooms everything you'll save a little bit in the middle well yeah natureboy skits you know you got break your dad didn't roll really nice damn yeah well I expected just really nice ground-up flour doesn't realize anything in there that shouldn't be in there absolutely don't think I can see anything anyway find it all stem is that just a sugar leaf you know it actually is sugar leaf they're so round itself [Music] yeah maybe it's honey's best I don't feel like a stem nut feels proper song might be Tony's bit stoner part from that looking pretty [ __ ] silent it's a nice ground flour it's not amazing that I put it out suppose for some great skills yeah certainly some diggin dogs as well which is just maybe it's been hand ground other than I probably Grandal to be fair a grinder this certain is it's a nice and well ground and I saw some really nice flower I don't know what I was expecting but I thought we were gonna see obviously I'm a DS need to boys pre-order many boom really nicely and stuff I just for whatever to one see exactly what's in there you know I've seen in the spirit of lots of a pre-roll and West case we review them and an Instagram afford apron assault so we could have another loss certainly seems like nothing untoward at the ordinary there's nice ground or flower Labadie the specs so yeah Nature Boy skills pyrrole well I have to do is we roll this now actually gets focus making it but yeah I must see the flash run quickly as well just so you can see that what and where I'm seeing just saw some really nice brown flour yeah it's we the flash on not really helping us see anything who have already seen things this you see for some nice grams of flour really really nice I rise today from that flush is doing anything frizz really is it yeah natureboy stick it was pretty rolled 1.5 grams maybe those are tiny that was stemming now I'm still not even sure if that was the spending it was proper soft and that look it might have been a tiny little step in there but apart from that it's all obviously for fire very nice ground-up flower so yeah and I we see comes with you little lacerations well fun you know sort of forget about Rosie a nice little feature on the pre-roll yellow flash boots like that grieve that that will certainly get some use out of so time to roll this [ __ ] back up like I said that's your meter boy skills 1.5 grab pre-roll go in just to check everything's what it should be in there yeah sound is always bigger major boys as well ways bringing as that fire and yeah what we do this so maybe different if you wanna see me got some more pretty girls let me know its best pure whatever Gordon actually a lot what's inside but yeah there we go Nature Boy skill was lucky a real soon with some washing your people I just wanted to hop on really quickly so bringing into this video obviously I just got that skittles pre-roll I have actually smoked it now as well well I've actually a build-up to spliffs out of what was left of it to sort of nice press smoke one absolutely fire banging taste to it some of the nicest skills I've tasted and the skills are reviewed the skills of my channel was definitely a ladder flavor the UK grade one and boy I would have said wow this the skittles wasn't necessarily as quite loud a flavor of some skills of smoke before the actual taste was bang on like initially tasted like some skittles like the sweet sort of thing no absolutely [ __ ] banging so yeah obviously I just wanted to hop on and say you know end of this pre-roll video have you seen what's inside there even sorted all right that was a little stem I personally not even sure that was still estab if it was it was certain very small stem but it was also not mud softened but certainly didn't affect you know or wouldn't have affected I'd imagine the way the pre-roll would have smoked yeah because it was been him you made bright white ash as you'd expect from eh boys so yeah I just wanted to hop on and just sort of bring that to an end bring it to a close sort of thing you know like anyway actually fought to the flower when I smoked it what's absolutely banging and if you want to see me got more pre-rolls you know see what's inside him and stuff let me know because I can do that yeah I also just want to say we're nearly at 2,000 subscribers it's a big everyone that subscribed really does mean a lot and we've got a cherry gelato and a dosey doe UK two different trains UK reviews coming soon and also going to do a little sort of 2k celebration sort of adventure maybe sort of video so you've got that to look forward to as well but yeah just want to hop hard and bring this video to a close let you know that that the skills was actually banging to smoke as well rather than us seeing what's inside it but yeah Bingle paper wasn't subscribed like I say it did pundits to me back here with another review more content for ya real soup", "0ierR_tIBZc": "all right you guys here we go whoa valley pure farmersville review are you guys ready man check this out love it out here i don't know where i'm at somewhere in the country but here at valley pier and farmersville they carry some of the best cannabis in california the team tony heather richard look at this sea junkie genetics from cookies the cryptochronic from alien labs and the biscotti from connected so i'm gonna review one of these today i'm gonna do the biscotti we're gonna do the connected biscotti because we've reviewed this in years past one of the most searched strains on our website all the time every day the biscotti joint pre-roll let's check it out shall we so one thing you guys got to know is connected is well known for premium cannabis all throughout california elite genetics there's a unique history between them and cookies and the you know the whole history of who created the genetics and all this stuff it's just it's really interesting so this biscotti pre-roll one gram total thc 20.17 percent cbd .05 percent there is thca for this 21.9 their delta 9.96 packaged on july 15 2020 so not too bad packaged by leaflets incorporated connected cali here we go all right let's check it out there's a smell outside of the pre-roll this should be good here we go oh there's a nice gassy funk we've got a raw paper here check that out a nice raw paper it does ah the smell is super pungent here we go i'm excited hopefully it's not packed too tight oh damn it you squeeze it and there was a stem that poked through it there's always something with these p-rolls i swear i swear i swear look at this right there all right here we go there we go here we go here we go here we go all right all right all right one hit talk about it two hits and a score you guys know the [ __ ] rules no games no fakes here we go let's get a nice even light for this first hit best we can all right here we go y'all oh here we go here we go [Music] the terpenes extremely notable a nice healthy looking white ash on the tip there no seeds yet [Music] the smoke is smooth the turps get even better on the second hit the more it burns it's burning a tiny bit uneven but that could be from the light you know one hit review very much impressed this was an 18 gram joint grand price point for me still a little excessive yes weed is legal in california yes this is designer weed i'll cut it a little slap because they are well known for this you know the elite of the elite but 18 to 20 gram joint just a little high sell a lot more if we get it down a little bit um score out of 10 for the joint effort pre-roll reviews i'm gonna give this joint it does have a massive stem poking through it so i got to give it you know i can i can't give it any higher than a 9.5 that stem is going to burn funny 9.25 is my score for

youtube the whole nine love you guys peace", "kRTXU8MYw7w": "what's up welcome to true buds TV it's your buddy Jack how to make your own pre-roll conjoint it's simple and cost-effective we're using the rips today I think there's like six feet of paper in here so you can make a lot I know a lot of the pre-rolls I see online and it stores well to be real with you they look really overpriced and I would have paid that money I'm gonna show you how to be yourself easy and you don't need to use rips you can use any paper but the same method applies let's dive in make a pre-roll and stuff that thing up just grab a piece of paper cut it in half or a third or you can do the full thing I'll show you what that looks like in a minute go ahead and roll it into a nice cone shape no right or wrong way here you can watch how I do it I'd like to give a little extra and make that tip nice and firm what you want to roll it as tight as possible wrap it right around there and then you're gonna go ahead and grab your tape and you're gonna tape that and the paper cone is set to go next parts are optional you don't need to cut the top off but I'm just gonna go ahead and do it give it a chop and the next thing we're gonna do is go ahead and grab our papers we're going to pull out of rips about the same size as it cone cut that just go ahead take that paper give it a lick roll up a nice come here now let's go ahead and set that down put the paper coat on there and roll it from the bottom on up you want it to be nice and tight so that when you pull it out it stays and it's a nice perfect to come keep rolling don't stop just roll it right past the paper until there and it is three two one and there perfect go ahead and stick your finger in and pull out the inner paper mold this will leave you with a nice perfect pre roll well almost perfect couple more steps we're gonna use our raw filter tips today and we're gonna go ahead and fold those up and just toss it right in the end there you could do it without this highly recommend it though especially because you're gonna be packing it down makes it easier and yeah I wouldn't do it any other way and you can make it filtered about anything just find any piece of paper that has a little resilience we're gonna go ahead and stick that right in the back of the cone tap tap tap tap tap and we're going to go ahead and cut the top of the paper off so it's even and easy to fill but there it is that's the pre roll you would spend money on and now that you have the mold you can just keep making them really simple now there's a couple different ways I like to do this first you could just drop it in just like that and stuff it down this works its effective the second way is just dump it on there and push it in this is maybe a little more effective but my personal favorite the most effective is describe a piece of paper and fold it and chop it sell it's manageable to hold and go ahead and dump it in there and just use it as a chute to slide it right in there makes things a lot faster the paper is laying around it's not waste we're making you see everything here you're making the process speed up a little bit keep going ahead filling it packing it down you want to keep doing this you don't want to fill it and then pack the whole thing down or also be too loose you want to do it in steps it's a process fill it packet Philip packet and repeat let's go ahead and twist that top off here dress it up that cone is looking fat nice and there you see it it's not hard to do you got yourself a perfect color right there and that's how you make a pre-roll and that's still a fat size you know if you're passing out around to but here's how you make a bigger one let's take a full piece of paper making the same style cone but you're gonna pull two pieces and combine them this time just right on top each other now it's like one extra extra large go ahead same process roll that out from the bottom give it a lick twist it project there it is and that's a huge one thank you for chilling today I hope you found this video helpful and if you liked it give it a like drop a comment and let me know if there's anything else you want to see especially when it comes to rolling up because you know I love to roll up also don't forget to subscribe to true buds tv.com to be eligible for all our future giveaways thank you guys

back to star cash games oh but wait we're bout to getting something a little different it's legal does it get you high what definitely has the possibilities to make you feel better health-wise but don't hold me on that if you're under 18 I don't know how you got here because this review is eight restricted let's go [Music] I'm not gonna bore you you know you could read that while I'm enjoying my favorite favorite hemp flour from tweedle fans and that is lifter I'm like in other reviews you heard me mention it as well so you could read all that while I enjoy this have you checked out Twitter farms yet if you have tell me what you've bought it tastes lovely it smells lovely and hit you so fast again this is not wheat it's in come from the same plant it come from the same mama don't get it twisted does not get you high all the benefits without the high do get a little buzzed I mean I mean shits coming from the same thing but it's just in the same plant but it's not the same thing Bern's lovely so yeah I didn't want and I don't need to go on and on about this because again if you hadn't seen that video it's up there somewhere or it's gonna be at the end of this this one so you could check it out and hear all about lifter anyone finish this on me then we're gonna speed this up yo guys again check out tweedle farms my favorite strain and I'm gonna pre-roll is their lifter yeah Twitter fonts [Music]", "YyeYeKGCpD8": "[Music] we'll then start by initially going very slowly and turning machine up and as you do this you'll start to hear a little bit of electronic sound initially coming to machine as you can see here we're starting a very low vibration and building up that you can see here the butter medium setting with the machine this tends to be the area in which beetles start loading a lot more material in and working that material this is going to start initially packing down and vibrating that material in there now if you start to have an issue with things floating at the top and not packing down properly there's a nice convenient function of this machine which is at the high function as you start turning it up the vibrational difference and what we're doing here this will initially have your product vibrating on top and sync it down that knowing that it can't over pack your free rolls if you have so much waited product on the top so always staying conscious of how much material you're working with at all times will keep your p rolls from being over packed or under packed and occasion from here if I feel comfortable enough with my three roles in pack I will turn the Machine down and off to this low-end all function for safety purposes you can't turn the Machine off as well afterwards so I'm just gonna be moving this machine up to a very good tampering speed here to where we can actually start introducing the product and three rolls I'm not looking for an aggressive speed by any means just something very light to make a nice movement on there and as you can hear that's kind of the sound we're looking for on this very light as I'm moving my material into this I'm stirring it maintaining a good consistency of product if it separates with the Keith on the bottom there and we started getting a lot of big material on top it can make for a very uneven pack and it will make it a very major struggle for you as far as getting all of your joints evenly packed as you so desire as we're going through this and getting an even pack you can see that not many of these are vibrating and moving which is meaning that they're not sinking into the pre-roll any further than what we have it so this is when we're going to step up the motor a little bit and see if it can sink them in as you can see they're starting to rotate further and further and the center ones are starting to have a much more dense pack we want to make sure every single one of these pre rolls is capable of moving on its own to get the pack we so desire I'm not pushing these in by any means but slowly rushing them over across from each other and as you can see a lot of the seeds and the stems are pushing their way to the top through this vibration to do one last finishing product I am going to give it a high volt and as you can see they sunk at his best it good there from there I feel rather confident in my pack and I'm really curious to see where these pre-roll sets so I'm going to unscrew my locking screws here out of convenience and just keeping your parts and pieces together again I highly recommend just keeping these with the tray if you have a container next to you or anything else like that feel free to put the locking nuts in there however do not worry about the washer so much yet until we get this top tray out the top tray I'm gonna move on over to a reclaim Abul bucket over here in which this product is completely viable and ready to go for another run or any other process that you're wishing to do we can set it down here or a nice easy way to get these out is make sure you grab your washers set it aside and tip it upside down as you can see here all these are kind of full still so you can proceed to give them a tap and go forward some of these may be rather densely packed in there so I highly recommend having a ballpoint pen or even metallic chopsticks is actually a very useful tool we use around here as you can see we're ready to go and the material is packed and ready to go right there for another run or whatever you desire to do with it from here I'm gonna be taking out the base the bottom tray pulling it out making sure I'm not hitting any of the pre rolls we're gonna look at those crunches just to make sure and see how even those are going down on the bottom making sure that all our papers are completely even the same size now different papers are gonna have different specifications as far as their tolerances go and being made manufactured so keeping that in mind when we're working with these can give us a lot of different variables so now that the machine is not going to prevent that from here we press down and as we see here before us all our papers are pushed up and forward and ready to go from here they're gonna need a pack as well as a fold on them depending how you like your product you may need to insert a tiny bit more material in one or take out other material and others but then 10% variable is what we're saying with our machine here and you're next a little free roll", "kS6h25pkeT0": "[Music] [Music] [Music]", "QK6ILN8mHeU": "hey what's going on everybody jay ping here checking in live respectmyregion.com i've got an official west coast we tour review today featuring ember valley one of california's most popular a bud tender favorite across the state i'm very excited today's strain is the berry jack hybrid thc listed at 23.1 percent we've got cultivation date march 2nd 2020 packaging date may 7 2020 so we're looking at cannabis that is you know roughly five and a half months old packaged on may 7 so roughly packaged uh three months and two weeks ago so definitely something that should be good should be terpy should have a lot of flavor i'm personally excited so let's dive right in i will give you guys a one hit review and then two hits with the score per how i usually do it in my joint effort pre-roll series i open the tube as i smell it there's this slight fruity chemically smell but unfortunately it does look like there is a bunch of flower cannabis outside of the pre-roll and in the tube so let's check this out here yeah there's definitely definitely some good some shake coming out of here it looks like it's probably coming out of the mouthpiece which would make sense because as you guys can see there is a complete open circle in this joint mouthpiece there is not a crutch super interesting that there's not a crutch here hopefully it doesn't impact a smoking experience but i'm definitely sure that cannabis is floating out of this and into this too because there's you know because there's no approach we've got a nice evenly stuffed j that is how it came in the joint i did not unravel it yet so i can see that is as this is bouncing around in the tube because it's not twisted flour is leaking out of the joy tube so a little bit of quality control there but it's hard it's tough with the pre-rolls it really is because so much happens um you know sometimes it's only done by hand sometimes brands only use you know machines to stuff them etc i'm not sure at the details so let's just dive right into the smoke shall we the dry hit has flavor but dry hit us flavor and i didn't get scooby snacks in my mouth when i just did that dry hair so that was nice all right here we go you guys ready so on the first hit right there very smooth um not much flavor the aftertaste right now [Music] it's just really that of burnt smoke burnt paper uh a little bit of burnt earthiness i'm not getting a huge terpene profile that i would think would come with berry jack so second hit usually we get the better taste let's check it out yeah so per usual second hit much more flavorful you guys can see i got the cough that time um let's see i'm getting notes of berry i'm getting limonene i got a little bit of pinene again this is the berry jack so i would expect a little bit of that terpinoline a little bit of that pinene the limonene that you would get in a jack herrera cross or a dutch treat or an amnesia hay something along those lines but this berry here gives it this earthiness and those these berry tones i'm really liking it let me hit it one more time and i'll give you guys the official score out of 100 simply because that first taste did not that first hit did not do this justice the second hit was so tasty a third hit is necessary here we go all righty so i have 10 categories for this uh pre-roll review the west coast we tour official official rating system does 100 points ten categories each uh presentation first you know i look at the ember valley tube and i think you know it is a basic joint but i really enjoy the logo the font and the white and red coloring i think it pops so although it is a standard joint tube um you know plastic not glass i'm gonna give them a decent score uh probably you know somewhere in that eight to nine range um simply because you know i do like their red white and black that they do i think it's attractive appeal same thing ember valley has lots of respect and clout here rightfully so and rightfully earned in california so i do feel like the appeal is there again i'd have to go eight to nine closer to a nine the color you know you talk about the color what is color meaning canvas well when i look at the joint and i look at the color of it you know if this joint were wrapped in the same paper and i could tell that the wheat inside was brown well then the color would be bad so color on this is appropriate for a flower pre-roll there's chunks in here i can see some some good bits of pre-roll is an attractive color you know it could be barf brown or green it's just not attractive so the colors there the smell when i opened the tube i said that there wasn't really a terpe smell but to correct myself there was berry notes there was this you know slight gassy musk maybe not gas but this muskiness and i think that's evident that it is one of the very uh notes or natures of this strain the berry jack so smell i'll give it you know maybe a high six maybe a low seven now when i talk about the taste the first hit not so great and as a consumer that first hit is usually everything that's going to determine whether or not they really want to keep smoking it or how impactful that that experience you know how powerful that memory really is so taste with this i'm gonna give it an you know a nice eight to two you know eight point two five to a five probably closer to eight point two five i like it i wish there was more jack to it um that first hit kind of gave me a little bit of a sour puss taste you know what i mean it just wasn't the best so i'll give it the 8.25 on the taste for this uh it tasted good i don't want you guys to you know be get this get this the wrong way it does taste very good um potency potency potency potency when we're talking potency that's thc 23.1 this is a sativa i'm talking talking talking i got lots of energy i think the potency is right on point um it's hard for me to give it at a 10 out of 10 when the thc scores are low but i do feel that the thc the terpenes are you know creating a nice entourage effect i can feel my heart kind of racing and pumping due to the sativa nature the sativa hybrid nature of this so potency i'll give it the i'll give it the 8.75 maybe even the nine i think it's right up there with where it should be potency-wise for this strain um experience you know i'll give it a nine i'll give it a nine because you know these pre-rolls can range anywhere between 13 and like 18 bucks sometimes you might even pay 20 for the grand but that's that's pretty rare so with that said the experience for me i feel is appropriate for the price appropriate for the smoke the strain i'd say the experience for me is a perfect ah maybe you know i'll give the experience a nine i'll give the experience a nine and the reason why i give it a nine is because again there was some some scooby snacks throughout the j it wasn't twisted perfectly uh the ash is looking good um but that first hit was rough now more information available is a new category this year for us the reason why we added that is because as a consumer i want to be able to look up more information about the strain or more information about the brand you know instagram facebook linkedin etc so lamber valley has a strong internet presence there could always be more information about the strain and pre-rolls you know helping me to guide it you know lighter versus you know the hemp wicks etc so more information available i'm gonna give them a solid eight uh i do feel like more like i say most brands can improve on this more more information should always be available the day that a brand gets a 10 out of 10 is the day that i'm celebrating and filming a video just shouting out that brand hasn't happened and what i recommend i would absolutely recommend this berry jack hybrid from amber valley i feel like it's worth smoking you know 10 out of 10 times i just wish this particular joint was a little bit more less messy you know the pre-roll being kind of undone at the tip kind of impacts it but yes 10 out of 10 i would recommend an overall score for me ah when i taken things all in consideration and just to give it an overall rating i'm gonna stick with a solid nine um i think you know the strain the flower the actual cannabis side of things made it a very positive experience but i definitely feel it's important to highlight some of the other things you know the scooby snacks um you know there could always be more information available online uh there aren't actually any terpenes listed here on the joint tube so i feel like that is kind of a missed opportunity that could be still capitalized on over the you know next few years so overall score 9 out of 10 this is a high quality pre-roll i highly recommend you guys visit any of the dispensaries in norcal or socal that carry amber valley there's literally i believe 150 to 250 dispensaries that carry amber valley maybe more if you guys have any questions about this product any of my ratings or rankings please feel free to drop a comment and send me a dm i would love to talk with you about my thinking about why you know why i chose these numbers and this you know the strain et cetera so appreciate you guys

does it get you high what definitely has the possibilities to make you feel better health-wise but don't quote me on that if you're under 18 I don't know how you got here because this review is interested in let's go [Music] [Music] you know this smells amazing yo what's up y'all shout out to tweedle farms and I'm about to go to work we're gonna start this and finish later the smell of this is lovely but before I even let it oh my god you haven't worked under my to the farmers use yet I'm mulling them at the end of this video so right now we bout to get into the bone cush hemp can you see it yes 100 pure hemp flour monocyte it says do the know somewhat subtle at first but as soon as this cracked open the aroma is loaded with a grassy gassy skunky pregnancy that is immediately reminiscent of his parent bubba kush and it's cousin OG kush that's why I like it because LG cush girl this so a little bit of a stressful morning till afternoon I was like you know okay I want to have a great time at work you know all the time is really fun is you know but I need to relax because you know I had a doctor's appointment this morning it's a little bit stressful everything's all good but it was just stressful looks like about finishes before I go it smells amazing someone asked me a question the other day does its you know how come in your place is a smell like you know weed or even hemp hemp doesn't smell like weed I mean yeah that I could consume the the the the TA Sam like I said in this video because I was about I consume the other as well not so often but I don't like stinky pungent Punk pungent but whether it be CBD or the other I don't like it so I guess I'm very picky yet as well so this is cush hemp outdoor one gram and I'm looking on the site okay Amy sent me it's NEC and one gram eath alright so one gram ten dollars 835 for fifty seventy-five an ounce one swing not bad but it's sold out I understand why I am really enjoying the products from tweedle farms I mean of course you know my favorite one is lifter but this is nice and smooth it's relaxing me I'm like yes but to do this ot for the 11 son now I've tried there there you know the individuals button and the people I like the pre-rolls cuz you know me I like you know I'm using the pipe as well but I like approvals cuz you know I think you know wrapping is what the Guru and so I like when it comes done for me [ __ ] and you know packaging a nice little you know you can reuse these I mean as well you know just when you're done take off the label because if your input in the same [ __ ] in there don't live saves from Twitter farms I'm very relaxed it's hit the spot I maybe I needed to I'm right here but to knock out this ot I need to be in a good mood and this is surely doing it shot it again to tweedle farms I mean yeah I got nothing but good things to say about this company number good things and I mean it may be sold out now but keep checking back you know again I can't say tweedle farms or you got to do is google it and no this is not weed it's not gonna get you high you get everything if you've smoked the other stuff - the high there you go CBD I mean does it

companies that I've been experiencing CBD amino Coast those that I made hey take this Lee's taste is subjective I guess I don't know can you use that in this instance but yo Twitter forms is up there from bud pre-rolls yes on whatsapp is it do 14 I gotta get out of here yeah well I'm out [Music]", "VCkZZiAJYeI": "hey everyone I'm here to tell you more about the semi-automatic tube labeling machine I'm gonna show you how to put this machine together I'm going to show you how to operate this machine now I will show you how to make a couple modifications to this machine to make it work better pre-rolled - hey everyone first things first I'm going to show you all the pieces that come with your semi-automatic tube labeling machine and then I'm going to show you how to put it together so first starting on this right-hand side we have these two plastic guides these are gonna help you position your label into the right orientation so that when you label your container the labels get blurred on to the right part of the container on one of these guides you'll see an additional wire piece here this wire piece will help you know exactly when to stop turning this handle so that you've only labeled one label onto each container and you don't accidentally put a second label on or anything like that you have these two additional arms these arms will basically secure the guides that I just showed you in place one of the arms will come with an additional wheel this wheel is essentially to put some extra pressure on the container make sure you get an even label on the container make sure that it's nicely adhered to the complaint it will come with one of these rods this rods is basically for holding the labels in place it'll come with these two rod holders so that the rod can actually be installed onto the label roll it'll come with this label clip this clip will basically hold down the excess paper that's coming off the labels and rewind it and then it will come with some extra washers and these foam attachments you'll need these washers and foam attachments basically for hinged lid container you need to make some slight modifications to this machine in order for it to work with anything that hasn't changed lid so that would be pre roll to us for instance you also just need two pieces of painters tape you'll need a two screwdrivers with Phillips head one very small one maybe something you can use on computers and just one regular one and then we have labels here of course these are B OPP and we would recommend vo VP or vinyl to be used as these are here best to the pre-roll tubes especially when you're working in a dusty environment or you know how cannabis is oily so that can cause a lot of adherence challenges so definitely recommend using vo TP or vinyl and then lastly we have our pre-roll tubes here we actually have two different pre-roll tubes these ones are made in the US they're a little bit more expensive but they're just going to be a higher quality more consistent in terms of always being straight and you'll see of course that it has an image lid like most people tubes do these ones are slightly cheaper tubes made overseas they're pretty good but they're not going to be straight every single time so I took out some of the worst offenders from abashed in terms of how curved they were and we're gonna try them out on the machine see how they perform so next up we're basically just going to show you how to put everything together and then we're going to get into labels and tubes alright so first step in putting this whole thing together and since we're doing pre-roll tubes we're going to want to make our modifications first making the modifications first is going to be much easier in terms of just access everything and working over this machine so we take the small Phillips head screwdriver and we just unscrew the blade here so once you've removed the blade then you can add the foam insert so the foam inserts you're essentially gonna want sort of in the center of where your labels are gonna be so if I take my roll of labels and I think I'm gonna have a position probably right around there then I know that my foam inserts should be just just about there so once I know that I take one of these pieces of painters tape and I just tape it on to the inside and so that I could put this piece of foam right here right around this piece [Music] and I'm just gonna want to really pull it taut when I do it all right so now that you have both foam inserts on and it is okay if there's a little bit of space you can quite make the foam inserts reach each other we do want to minimize the amount of space as much as possible however the next step is going to be reinstalling this blade so we reinstall the blade with this blade side facing away from me so facing towards the rollers and you'll see that because this foam insert is here now we can't reinstall the blade quite as easily or at all really and so what we're gonna want to do is we're gonna want to install five washers on each side so the washers over the holes and we'll just reinstall this blade right here alright so now that you've installed your pre oral modifications to the tube labeling machine we can move on to installing the labels on the actual machine so we can get started lately so we'll take our labels and we'll install our rod holders this label is a three inch diameter so everything on here is gonna come to work with 3-inch diameter ladies so we install the rod holders just like so and then we put our rod right through the right through it and we Center our labels and we're gonna want to make sure that when we put this rod in and the labels in the labels are going to unwind with the label facing down so just make sure as you do this keep that keep that in mind you want the labels facing down when you install it so we take our guides and we have two guides this wire right here we want that up to be on the inside so this is going to go on the right hand side and then this one's gonna go on the other side and we're just gonna leave it sitting like this and we're gonna take our arms again there's two arms and there's also screws on the top the screws should be facing upwards and we want the wheel on the inside in between the guides so this is gonna go on the right and this is gonna go on the left with the screws facing up this one's a little bit tight so I just and I bring this all together and I Center it and then I just lift it up so the notches are all aligned so that when I go to install this I can just get all the notches in there and then I drop down the rock set in there straighten everything out and then I'm gonna tighten these guides these are arms so that the guides can't move around alright so now that we've got our labels installed they're in the right position we have everything ready to go so we're gonna take our labels here and we're gonna drag it through underneath this and then we're gonna try to feed the labels through underneath the blade now I'm behind the machine which is quite a difficult way to install them but you're gonna want to be on the other side of the machine luckily I'm just doing it this way to show you guys that you can see everything so I'm just gonna thread it through here and then I'm gonna bring the labels back onto this rod I'm gonna take that label clip we had got and I click it right on make sure everything's good there and so now when I pull this label when I pull this handle it's just gonna wind up the labels wind them up and it's gonna bring the next label out and you can see right there the label is ready to get adhered to something all right so now that I've installed the labels and I lay down my tube right here I can see right now where its position the label is gonna be mostly on the top end of the tube I don't really want that I want it centered in the middle of the tube with about a half inch to 3/4 inch space of the top and n so we have this guide here which will help us do that but the way it's installed right now it doesn't really give us enough space to do these long 109 mm pre-rolled tubes so basically I'm just gonna take this piece off and I'm gonna take this nut off and leave this one on so I'm only taking off this middle nut right here and I'm leaving the rest on I'm gonna want to sort of adjust the height here so I put down the tube and they see what height does it need to be at and then if I see right there it's actually slightly in the wrong position this piece isn't really in the middle of the tube so we're actually gonna want to adjust that first so I bring this back up tighten it and then I'm gonna loosen a screw down here which will allow me to move this a little bit more to the center here and then just tighten it right back up now that I have it more centered I can bring this down and now it's in a good position tighten it at the height I want and we're almost ready to go so as you can see it there's a little bit too much space between these two rods for the diameter of this tube since this is quite a narrow to like all pre-rolled tubes are we're gonna want to sort of just bring this rod forward so the way we do that is we're gonna loosen these wing nuts on the side on both sides which will then allow us to slide this a little bit closer together and we're gonna want a little gap but not too much and we're gonna want to make sure that the tube can still roll around this looks about good and then I'm just gonna tighten these wing nuts again so that the rod can move all right some work right here is your wire guide and you can adjust this wire by moving it back and forth and so right now this is perfectly adjusted for our labels but what this will do essentially is as you turn this handle you'll see that the wire guide is following the label so we know as soon as this wire guide hits the space in between the two labels one whole label has come out of the machine on the other end so right here is we know we stopped the handle and we take the container off because we have done one whole label at that point so what you're gonna want to do with these labels is you're gonna want to make sure you have about a half inch to a 3/4 inch of the label out before you lay the tube down you're gonna put the tube against your marker here and you're gonna press it right into there and then you're just gonna unwind the rest of the label and then you have it on just like that now the machine to get really you know full efficiency full speed out of this thing you do have to get used to it a little bit get your groove in but once you have it in it is very easy to label and I'm doing these backwards so of course it's a little bit harder but yeah just make sure you have a little bit of the label out press your tube down put some pressure on it roll it and then it's on [Music] all right so I've just lined up the tubes that I just labeled and you can see if you look at the top right here you could see that the accuracy is very close it's getting put into the same position each time this is just gonna make your product look more professional there's gonna be less chance of any type of error there's less chance of adherence issues because you're getting the same kind of pressure and into the same position each time and then of course your fingers are just not gonna get tired so you could be labeling all day you could be labeling all day the next day you could be labeling all day the next day and the next day and the next day and you'll be fine you'll be able to do about 250 to 500 an hour with this machine so it is definitely a lower volume machine for smaller rides but it carries a very cheap price point so now that I've shown you all the parts that come with the machine how to put the machine together and how to operate the machine let me just talk about some of the general benefits of using a semi automatic food labeling machine like this first and foremost is going to be consistency I think and see from the tubes that we just labeled the six or seven that we did each one has a very very consistent distance from the top of the tube to the label so you're gonna get the label in the same position almost every single time next is operator stress now this machine is going to totally eliminate any operator stress if you're if you're labeling tubes by hand you know how much effort on your fingers and how much stress it produces on the operator on their fingers in order to label tubes by hand using a machine like this you could label twos for eight hours a day with minimal minimal stress the only actions are really doing is placing the tube down and turning the handle so very very little stress on the operator now this setup that I've shown you is the general setup for any type of containers but as you noticed we didn't really use this wheel at all we found that the wheel doesn't work that well with very small narrow containers like the pre-world oops and we tinkered around with the Machine a little bit and we think we've come up with a slightly better setup for pre-rolled tubes specifically so I'm gonna jump into that I'm gonna show you how to modify this machine a little bit with some very basic supplies in order to make it work a little bit better for pre-roll the tubes so in order to do this modification you're going to want to take the Machine League apart so we've removed the play we removed all the arm to remove the guide remove the labels and what you're gonna need is gonna need to buy some o-rings and we purchased these from Lowe's or Home Depot just 2.50 these are 15 16 15 / 16 inch inner diameter Oh rings that are one patient thank you so we have 1000 rings in here and what we're essentially gonna do is we're gonna put the o-rings over this - we're gonna put it over this - and we're going to use the o-rings to secure the labels and play since we really didn't need these arms or the wheel we can just use these o-rings that's gonna make putting new labels on much easier and much faster so let's just get right into some of these modifications right here the first step is is we're gonna want to get our rings on these rods right here and so in order to do that we have to basically take the entire machine apart so before that we do that I just want to forewarn everyone and say that by taking the machine apart you can damage it and you can ruin your machine if you put too much pressure on us at this specific part if you make a mistake or if you lose something the machine you're not gonna be able to put it back together or it's gonna be difficult so do this at your own risk so the first step is going to be essentially to remove everything that's holding these two walls together so that's gonna be these bolts on the bottom right here as well as this turning handle which has essentially just an allen key right there now and wrench then you're gonna need to use in order to open that up alright so as you can see we've taken the machine totally apart we didn't really show taking it apart in too much detail the reason being is if you aren't really familiar enough with like screws and all these different little pieces to take the Machine apart we generally recommend that you shouldn't take the Machine apart because if you take this apart and you come to us and you say hey I can't put it back together we really can't help you this is like a personal mod this is just something that we played around with and figure it out and we can't really guarantee you know perfect performance or anything so this is just totally if something if it's something that you want to try out it's your prerogative and you can try it out and you could you can see it basically generally how it's done all right so first things first where we took this whole thing apart so basically that we could access these two rods and so what we want to do is we want to put all Rings on to these rods so simple enough I'm gonna put five on to the this rod and then three on to the other one you could experiment with different amounts of or ings on each one to see what works best with your process or or your container but we're good today we're gonna try five and three we think that's probably gonna do a pretty good job after I get all these all rings on onto each piece we'll put this whole thing back together and we'll show you some of the improvements and why it's a little bit better all right so now we've put the machine back together and we added a couple of our modifications and I'm just going to go over some of those ones that we've added so earlier in the video I said we were gonna add three to 500 rings we found that we think it's a little bit better with five and five and in fact it may actually be better on this back rod to have it all covered with o-rings as to where the label is and I'll show you why in a second and then another thing we did is we remove these arms since we're not really using this wheel and we also removed the guides and because our tubes are clear it's easier just to look through the tube rather than use this wire guide but if your tube was black or opaque then I'll show you how you could just add this office so what we've done with the labels here is instead of using the arms to secure the labels in place what we've done is we've actually used two o-rings and so that's just gonna make it a lot easier when you want an exchange out your labels with a new roll you just slide the o-ring off and then you put a new roll labels on you slide the o-rings back on and so that's works pretty good for us here and so next I'm just gonna show you a couple tubes run through this machine with its modifications and show you how it works [Music] all right so now you just saw me run a couple two different types of tubes through this machine on the left hand side we have the straighter more up slightly more expensive us-made pre-rolled tubes on the right side we have the slightly cheaper and they're the less straight tubes from overseas as you can see the tubes that are made in the u.s. that are straighter and a little bit higher quality you're gonna get much better adherence of the labels and you're gonna avoid a lot of wrinkling and stuff like that when you apply the labels whereas on the right hand side with the cheap red tubes if they're not perfectly straight you can get crinkling on the labels now I did choose the worst offenders I'm gonna pack up a thousand of these tubes and so these are really you're not going to get this every single time but you will get it if on the tubes that aren't straight so it is very important to use good quality tubes before you start labeling and also to use high quality labels that we like here relatives and so ultimately this machine it helps reduce operator stress helps you labels label fuel tubes consistently and it helps you label at a faster rate if you

coughing was it you paper probably because it's wrapped in paper all the time it's a sign bro so we're back now yeah we're back we're back sorry for that technical difficulties Wow definitely uh definitely got some kick to it I feel it already or not I do yes that's like right right at the base of Nick yeah yeah right but my eyes the grit in my eyebrow area too it's a really nice product uh it's a little dry though at first when you first start but once you get into it it's not so bad I believe it's I believe in some ways a container but they practice you know because it's a air proof container you know maybe being in there the whole like however long it was dried up a little bit yeah cuz the tops not you you know silver depending on how long it kind of sits before they ship it out could be maybe any better of a product but I mean I say it works yeah I mean it's all that you can handle to drive I mean just know that I mean you're gonna call full of it when you're smoking it when you first start out well at first Wacom wallpaper that always gets me like it always sends me like right into an asthma attack like the first to wax a wallpaper is always pretty rough but I got along the issues I mean if you guys don't already know that I mean no cost this much we we paused it and that got our technical difficulties in ordering now things are cool I like it I mean I it's not the products fault that I have lung problems you know and it's working I feel it since we're done here no drags off this thing's good we'll do the daily thing it is I can't say it enough minute dry yeah it is so first off packaging I think this is sweet I like it it's not there uh they have a green logo as well I don't think it's here just yet white and green is my thing for some reason um but they have uh they have an all green logo um I got a sticker from them in one of the older setup um not to say that this logo wasn't nice but it's it's definitely a really cool logo I just I'm biglan the big green I like how they're uh I like how they're their papers weight like it's almost like a with the glossy shiny color like it's like really close I like is the fact that they give you these tunes and you can just use them over and over and over and over again yes you could recycle them we could roll up your own something put it in there yeah you know you could take the plastic off and put a little sticker here I'm on there see you know maybe if you're in the arts and crafts I can put your beads in there yeah we're even still you can you know put your own logos on there you know like you're out and about and you're known as you know like j-dog or something you know not nice when you hang with your Bros you know put [ __ ] on there make it yours you know and when you go out and you pop it open you got your pretty role whatever you put in there cuz I use I use these over and over I have did I put my like my blunts and my pre-rolls in when I go out I'm different I think that it from that was the one that came with like just cigars yeah I was see we have to correct okay so I got it from CBD hemp was that CBD help direct and it was a really cool twist off top and a long glass tube and I kept it I took the sticker off it and uh I keep it and I put my stuff in there and uh someday I'm gonna have my own like Dan Blair logo made and put on there it'd be really nice so when I go out hang with my friends I can have my own custom [ __ ] it's really nice so uh I've got these I got these like five of them I'm uh I'm gonna say that uh the packaging is really cool I like it what about you definitely I like it a lot so the packaging um there's just something about reusable containers yeah yeah for sure Oh next on the list is want to scale one to five for a nerve yeah for half I feel it I feel it I do feel that it's lifter so of course it's gonna be like lifting the product itself let's let's get back to this the product itself we had pointed out that it was very well packed even this one is pulled this one on there's very well packed it's nothing coming out like other pre-rolls have encountered as you can see like oh that's why I see the bottom of tube there isn't like one little strip across it's like a whole roll that's pretty nice I also like how this end the like the little flag II parked it's always there so you like to twist they cut that off I like that that's that's a good little thing to do there Twingo farms um I would keep with that get off yourself I mean it could burn down it's kind of annoying so you guys you're onto something they're cutting that little top off there I always take off my knife and cut it off myself me too me but it will be the car in Kamogawa yeah it's ready so the product is awesome it looks good as well packed I like the packaging on a 1 to 5 we give it a 4 and a half because you can feel it it works um it's definitely quality I'd say that uh if you want to relax and I say I mean you saw how much was invested granny they say yeah share between two people when we both feel it yeah I just imagine like you're on your smoke break at work call back and you just take one of those mm-hmm just like you're smoking like regular cigarette right let's smoke break that you'll feel it after a whole yeah and you'll be super you might not even gonna get through the whole thing you'll be mr. relax Oh at work oh yeah like I don't know what Tony's been doing on his breaks he's pretty chill guy lately let's all be like Tony yeah it's all be like Tony would I recommend the product yeah yeah yes yes tweedle Farms shout out tweedle Farms are recommended I don't think I don't think I've ever had a run-in with twiddle farms and without a product I don't like yeah then I wouldn't so forth I mean that's not to say we'll always be that way I mean not I'm saying no ever everything bad but you never know man you know I had that one that one company surprised me that uh that wax company that uh bio technics do dis stuff there's just some things out there so so far Twitter forms has been great I love their stuff and they're getting better this stuff is getting better and better like there there there are flowers are getting allowed so dank and sticky great smelling I have a couple that we have to review yet um I've got these I was really excited I wanted to do the other view review first but I was really excited about these because we don't get many pre-rolls and be able to do many pre-roll reviews and with that so many flower after flower after flower after flowering these it's kind of like them they've got the wax you know we just the rosin we other things in front of it but we're just so excited about that because it's something new that we just jumped into it you know like I jump into my pants every morning both ladies at once we're here it's saying it's I'm not more than one leg at a time guys die moaning imma dive on in I'm gonna be unique be yourself be different be be one-of-a-kind be 100 diver 100 keep it on so I'm trying to think if I have a I think I think I do I don't I think I put it in them I'll put it in the description I put their website info and all they have fo one knees wrap it up I guess say make sure you subscribe that's where we get into subscribe comment comment guys comments comments are awesome um which we share click the like button share ring the bell ding ding ding ding ding like you're at the what's that place we go to that Arby's you know like that ding ding ding ding the bone right like a like a like a navy like a navy yeah it's got like soft splashes all over horsey sauce with his wife beater los dedos you do those shoes to [ __ ] man that stuff is like liquid meat we talked one time before I go before I go we talk one time about a 30 day diet of nothing but a shoe sauce I think I think you'd have cholesterol probably I think you would have a freaking liver problem I think your kidneys would yeah I mean not only that but if they're anything you have like a coronary artery blockage in arteries you have some but I digress between the forms awesome product as usual it's a four and a half out of five we recommend it I feel it I can tell I feel it if you can't see if my face to that feels that something wrong I'm almost medicated I'm almost at 14% that's really good so get on over to Twitter forums I showed you the the specs they're well worth it they're really affordable almost another say this before I go to most pre-rolls that I get from other companies are either $15 $18 is eight bucks okay get you five of them like I did it's well worth the price to throw them in your bag take them out where you're going on the way to work or whatever I deliver food for a living so I'm constantly constantly stressed at work so I I medicate a good bit on the grub hub grind grind yet so until next time guys sorry about the rambling sorry about getting off of course they're sorry about the pause video but hey you know technical difficulties don't have any I don't I don't have any editing software so there's nothing much I can do about that we just kind of got a roll with it keep it organic like the products we promote and I'll see you guys in the next video thanks for watching", "x3EE7RkQzpc": "[Music] hey everyone today i'm here to show you a quick video on how to do a folded top on your pre-roll some people call this the dutch crown or the dutch fold so first i'm going to show you basically what a lot of you have probably seen in the market already that's the twisted top you know you just take the joint when it's filled like this you take the top and you twist it until you get a nice twist at the top so that's pretty common market a lot of people have seen that now what some people consider to be a more premium finish is this sort of dutch crown so you see how it's flat at the top versus twisted one some people think that looks cleaner and more professional and also more importantly they find this easier to light and that this type of twist at the top actually causes consumers to canoe the joint more because they basically mess up the first initial burn where this is harder to mess up the first initial burn since it's a flat top so let me show you how to do that it's actually pretty easy so you take one of your joints let's say and you want to make sure that it's packed down so you want to just go make sure that you have a firm top to fold against you don't want it to be loose at the top then when you fold it you have no structure to fold against so you just pack it down lightly make sure that it's flat where you want to fold it right now i'm just using one of the straws that comes with our comb boxes but in a production environment you're going to want to use like a metal rod a lot of people just buy metal chopsticks and that's what they use them for and so basically you fold it you tamp down the top you do your initial fold and you press down maybe do that once or twice then you take your next fold and you do that once and then you do your final fold and you do it like that and then i'm going to just take this little metal tool and i'm going to flatten it out and then you got your dutch fold right there so it's pretty simple a lot of um one mistake people might make is you know they might take like a more loosely packed joint like this and then they go to pack it down and then you have it way too packed down and then when you go to fold it you can't fold it because there's way too much paper at the top so a make sure you're getting the right size cone for the right fill weight so that when you do fill the joints that you get basically i would say that's three to four millimeters of space at the top maybe five millimeters of space at the top and then you could just take your tool and it's the perfect amount of paper to pull down and usually it takes three folds to really get it in there and then some people like to take like this flat bottom and then spin it on the top of the joint to kind of create this like cave look almost but that's really just up to personal preference so really simple to do it people really appreciate it bud tenders really appreciate it they think it's a better way to finish the joint so that when you go to light it it's a flat top you don't get any canoeing you don't get any issues just easier for the consumer to use yeah it takes a little bit more work than the twisted top but i think it really pays off so that's how you do it really simple share your results with us and if you have any more questions visit www.customconesusa.com and we have all sorts of products for pre-rolled cones pre-roll machines pre-roll packaging really anything to do with the pre-roll production process we can help you so thanks again for watching and see you next time", "xWXJ24qf-v4": "what's up girls Katie grass curry lounge now um I don't know this is a contrast is you know proper for this but here we go now I just wanted to talk about this real quick this wax roll that I got now I've gotten these before from different places and instances it's a sati but wax roll this for you guys who aren't aware of that and I got these um these pre rolls here these are just regular pre-rolls and basically what the pre rolls and the wax rolls are you know the wax roll will did a little bit more expensive because they they probably put their top shelf shake into the wax rolls covered in wax and then rolled it in Keef as you can see maybe you can't but it's covered in Keith so you get a pretty decent high off of this I don't know if the wax is sativa I'm assuming that it is I don't know if the key for sativa possibly but the shake that's in it one likely is Teva now this these five pre-rolls you see it is joints you see it I get these from the UH from uh from the dispensary now they have a deal at the ones that dispensary that I go through I got these items at two separate dispensaries by the way now these here they have a deal on the pre-rolls um I think is you get five for ten bucks and you spend a certain amount of bread I think you spend more than you use you donate more than five bucks and you get a free free dab or you get a a free pre roll now for you guys will know a dab is basically when you take some wax which is just you know you might want to concentrate you know there's a certain attachment that you put on your bong you know and uh you you basically scoop the wax out of whatever container is in you fill up the hole on your arm I forgot what they call the attachment put a dab and basically you know babies probably better to have a butane lighter you know something that you can use the heat the heat the way it's up and you cover it so the smoke doesn't escape so it's forced into the arm it's forced into the bong you hit it you know you hit it from from the top like you do a bomb and it concentrates the [ __ ] spectacular if you've never had one man it is definitely time to get out of wherever the [ __ ] you are and try this out because the wax is the dab has that [ __ ] all the grass you smoke you've never had a high like this before I'm telling you it is some good [ __ ] anyway so I got the free roll I like the pre-rolls you know you loosen them up a little bit because they they roll pretty tight loosen him up a little bit and they hit perfectly you know and I get I get a nice buzz off of it because they mix with bees alright because I asked them they mix a lot they mix all the shake up you know from out of their jars or whatever they mix all the things that are in display cases and stuff they mix it all up you know and then a Rollie pre-rolls you know sometimes I even roll up my grass with you know you know sprinkle in some of the pre-roll on it you know it enhances the high you know what I'm saying because you got all these different combinations of grass rolled into one and then mixing it with whatever particular strain you have at the time and you know it increases yeah for the most part I'm lit right now as you can see now not about this now and this um this wax is wax jump-off it's wax roll it's you know it's the same length as a regular pre-roll but as you probably can tell it's much thicker okay that didn't work out the way I wanted to do as much it's much thicker you know way thicker you know and it comes in its own special tube as you guys can see and I like it I I'm smoking it looks like about let's see let's try to do a a contrast and compare okay this is actually a little bit longer I will say X is a lot longer or rather the tip is longer so I would say that in okay so the wax roll is a bit longer but I smoked maybe about I would say maybe not a third of it cuz it was probably about you know so the white roads are much longer actually anyway so I smoked maybe about a quarter of this thing already right and I'm late and that was hours ago man it was hours ago and I'm lit off of this so it's definitely worth the money I paid $10 for this one you know you think about 15 out of 120 dollar ones you know in fact you know what I'm geeking that let's just show you how lit I am I actually got all of these from the same spot actually yeah that is I got all these from the same spot my back as you can tell the wax rolls are [ __ ] on point I am straight lit I it's three hours later and I'm still no I'm good man I'm good I just went in house went the red box last night watched um I got John wick - it's funny because I've never even seen him John with one sort of boss baby that was some [ __ ] and uh and I uh watched with and I watched the new King Kong movie that came out recently I finished watching that this morning you know I watched that in movies like what - I was longer something to that effect something like that it's close to it watch that eat had a coffee and a bagel and I'm still I'm still lit man it was three hours ago so I recommend I recommend the wax rolls I recommend pre pre rolls like I said um if you find out when you hit your pre row is a little bit too tight you know just loosen them up because you know these you see that they all twist it at the tip so you can kind of unravel the tips um and and start from the bottom and kind of roll them up so that it loosens it up so they're not so tightly compacted and I'm telling you it'll hit perfectly you know and depending on what your tolerance is you should get a pretty decent buzz you know but that's all I got for that I just wanted to do this video about you know with the pre rolls and these these wax rolls and that's about it how about you guys leave the peace", "nQ-9Sc3chD4": "hey everyone today i'm here to show you the king cone filling machine i'm going to tell you a little bit about the machine what comes with the king cone how you use it and how to create high quality pre-rolls with this machine so let's get into it the king cone is a cone filling machine for those wanting to step up their pre-roll production but aren't quite ready for a higher capacity machine like the cone packer or sluice box the king cone is great because it has a modular design which allows any of the parts to be easily replaced if worn out another great benefit is that out of the box the king cone is compatible with 109 98 and 84 millimeter cones and because of the king cone's modular design we can design custom trays for many different sized cones and tubes so now let me show you what comes with the king cone the king cone comes with a vibrating base which has a control panel on the side two overflow containers which catch any excess material which doesn't make it into the cones a cover shield to secure the overflow containers in place an 84-90 millimeter tray and an additional extension tray to do 109 millimeter cones finally the machine also comes with a lid to prevent any spillover so let me show you how it all works your king cone will arrive fully assembled but i will give you a quick rundown of how to put it together first you will place both collection trays on top of the vibrating base these will click into place thanks to the magnets on the bottom of the tray then you place the cover shield into place covering the exposed parts of the base an important thing to note is that there are two switches along the bottom of the vibrating base and you want to line these ridges up with the grooves on the switch so the cover sits flush with the vibrating base once you have the cover shield securely in place you should lock it into place by closing the switches on both sides next you place the base tray on top today we are running 84 millimeter cones so we don't need to add the additional tray we only need to add the additional tray if we want to run 109 millimeter cones the tray we have on right now works with 84 and 98 millimeter cones if you want to do other sizes of cones a custom tray can be made for whatever size cone or tube you want to use the first step is to load the cones into each individual slot there are 169 slots on this machine and once all the cones are loaded into the machine you want to spread the material across the top into each cone and as with other pre-rolled machines without a metering tray you will want to pre-weigh the material since we are doing half grand pre-rolls you will want to pre-weigh around 100 grams of material as you spread the material across the top you won't want to do it as evenly as possible use about half the material and run the vibration to ensure each cone is well packed once each cone is about half packed spread the rest of the material and run the vibration again this time you may want to place the lid on top to ensure that the material doesn't overflow once the cones are fully packed the next step is to pull the cone cartridge off the machine and place it on a flat surface once placed on a table the cones will pop out and can be easily grabbed to be finished off with a tamp and then either a twist or a folded top as you can see the king cone pre-roll machine is definitely a great way to increase production while still producing high quality prerolls one of the advantages of the king cone is that it actually bounces the cones up and down rather than just relying on vibration this helps create a good pack throughout the pre-roll so that's how you use the king cone to make high-quality pre-rolls if you have any questions at all or interested in any other pre-world machines packaging or cones please visit our website www.customconesusa.com thanks for watching",

so stay tuned see if it gets night gang [Music] keep down please smoke everywhere we go [Music] let's go baby fam we got the joint lit as you can see it is ripping you guys you guys see the cherry on that thing I think it's back what you guys think about it yes I really like the tip that it has on it it's like I never seen a tip like that before but I'm really liking it because it keeps all the Scooby Snacks we're coming in your mouth and we also noticed that you don't have to get a hella hard like I thought that you had to be like you know how like when you roll hella fat you've got to hit it hard know that one you can hit it regular like a regular joint and it's hitting really good yeah I'm hitting it way too hard it is pretty heavy you guys there's hella [ __ ] weed in there I mean what the weed included but the tip is pretty heavy left away the tip itself see how much it that's some Gaston I didn't even know there was constant rain there either I just see like the celebrity spike scenes and I was like in aware how much to smoke on what should be cat he was saying that bringing a joint like this is like bringing like a bottle oh yeah like okay it's like usually when you go see like a family friend or just somebody like that's important to you bring him like a like a cake or a bottle you know something for like this nice gift big Oh join make sure if you have it comes to your size I mean if you ever go see your friends you pull up with one of these and yeah and if you live in a set you better keep its rental in your pocket in case you're looking up saw yeah it's kind of running a little bit late yeah that's the only thing that I'm trying to figure out how would you stop that or just [ __ ] probably start lighting the other side once I feel like you need to have like [ __ ] yeah look we did it work to catch it up old fashioned hello saliva you know stop the look going out right hopefully that works let me know what you guys do to stop your plants from running put it on but so far what do you guys what do you think I'm highest luck gets high in here it's boxy to be honest with you I'm gonna give mine to pee I'm not gonna if I go it's its exhibits joint the [ __ ] flavor is could be more flavor II like I've been smoking some SF cultivators wedding pie $61 out the door testing at 31% that [ __ ] is way better way better than this but I mean I don't know maybe maybe I maybe it's the concentrates too though I'm just doing a little bit of flavor yeah I mean honestly I'm gonna keep it really guys I feel like it's not hitting like a hundred percent it could be I think if you roll do be better but yeah you know I don't like the fact that it's running so bad I think that's like my main problem with it and yeah I feel like I'm wasting away I'm so high that I'm just like [ __ ] you know but it's like if I were to rolled it I'd be more pissed because it's like damn you exhibit homies these are hand rolled them I see them making them I'm pretty sure I have no idea what is each test bet just a big flex guys we're smoking a [ __ ] $184 joint what let me know if there's things that you guys feel like it's just for the foot I feel like designer is just for the Flex you know I know bass quality to this testing at 27 percent by the way pretty high 27 percent concentrate don't see any wax running or anything like that either so I'm not really sure where the concentrate is in the joint I mean it is like white ash though all the way yeah it definitely does the job oh yeah let's play baseball you know what I was thinking is that like it's a big guys joint you want it to last you how long Lee I don't know I didn't set a timer but it's feel like I'm going kind of fast yeah yeah you right sure it's eight I mean there's still no cuz it's hella fat but it's like you think you'll be just custom ah don't underestimate you guys and then I just want to remind you guys to go cup some lady where a wave emerged a very explosive second exclusive that we got the sweats on Ted I got them on today real one make sure you guys go cop it going real quick thank you guys for supporting us shout out the whole way and we appreciate you guys for getting us here we got bigger things coming you guys oh my god looks like gonna burn your lips I know follow me let me like the other side back because I really like easy burn me I have bad luck burning myself with it I bet you as the video when it started it was not that smoky and now it's like the only thing I don't like okay so we're getting to the end what are you guys thinking is this what is $285 honestly it's not $1 i'ma tell you why you guys polite you could just get so much weed with that money you could just roll so many blunts that just getting so much higher I don't know that's my s what I so I think creating for me was worth it listen out listen up so it's a pandemic I can't come to accept that much I only hang out with them so much I only have so much time so we got to get hella [ __ ] high in a short amount of time [Music] want to get hella high in a short amount of time that's a good way and there's a lot of money well but it was worth it yeah it was worth anything I think I would buy it if I was like gonna go see ya like a friend that I haven't seen him tell along and like your city just said you're gonna top the whole chain because this thing was a [ __ ] but she doesn't really need a [ __ ] damn I feel like I'm hella re inhaling all the smoke we want some water free I got you Brandon thank you like really even higher we just sitting here no you're not going we get in one hundred and eighty dollars worth of Highness dog like who do you know is smokin a pumps let me know down in the comments if you guys have tried this grenade like cookies

see on the next one [Music]", "4d9TgN341Gw": "hey guys it's Florida MJ 4:20 here and today I'm going to show you how to roll your own cone joints at home so what you will need is some paper pair of scissors some cardboard tip material 1.25 papers you could use other size papers I guess but I use 1.25 s you need a pen and some masking tape so the first thing you're gonna need to do is make the mold for the that you're gonna need to make your cones so take the tip of the pen and get this so that it starts curling like that and then take your finger and roll it this part can be kind of difficult to get going stick with it so what you want to do is keep this end right here small and keep the whole thing in general not getting too fat unless you want really really fat cones of course you know however whatever shape this is in at the end is how your cone is gonna be shaped so really I guess you could make it all kinds of shapes if you want to that would be kind of cool to make a really big fat cone huh so and I'm sure everybody's done this in kindergarten rolling up some paper like this and I probably should have done this beforehand but you take your masking tape a little piece off yay I can do this all righty that's pretty cool now if I can find the end of this thing there it is right there just tape this right here and there you have the mold for your cone joints pretty cool huh all right imagine if we had paper is that big huh now we can set the tape aside and for the next part you got to get out your paper this part is pretty darn simple just kind of want to line this up at the bottom here so it lines up at the bottom of this form and just roll that sucker up and make sure you wet it before you let go so you get the paper to stick there you have the paper part of your cone take off one of your little deals here and get the pen part out of the middle right the ink part and you take this you can use other stuff too like a small screwdriver you just want to get this part started so it doesn't crease you know if you use the cardboard out of these they're a lot more likely to crease so using a tool like this really helps get this whole thing bent like that and now you want to take a look at your paper it's only about that big so you're not gonna need the whole thing down there what is it we all right now you take the filter cardboard and notice how this isn't even that's good that's okay because this isn't even either this is on a perfect cylinder you slide that down there stuff it down with the pin and you're almost good to go now this part this part right here there's a little bit easier if you have something like that has a screwdriver like and so you basically you just want to tighten that up down there and all you have to do is stick this down there and turn it like a screwdriver against the edges and it's this one's actually counterclockwise but you'll get the point so and you just want to turn it sideways like a screw until it's tight up against the edges so now we have our cone paper voila very cool huh and so you can change the size of your cone by where you roll it on here too you don't have to roll a completely different sized one but you can you can roll them fatter than this you know your form you can roll them skinnier you know however you want to really let's get some wheat ground up since I'm not really reviewing a strain today I'll just use my grinder get out some of the 27.4 7% evany and ivory I got in $125 an ounce sale stuff is pretty good it's got a little seeds on it but what are you gonna do right it's a good deal get this all ground up all right you might have gotten enough in there might need a little bit more and I forgot one thing that'll make it easier so I'll be right back all right now I'm back I think we will need more than this for a little bit more in the grinder oh it's all gunked up in there dang it is a sticky string got lots of trichomes on it those have a lot of seeds though a medical this is just powdered now all right I'll show you the seeds I got so here's I'm not done with those ounces yet but these are probably about three-quarters of the seeds I've gotten a lot of them were chopped up while I was cutting up the weed another thing you can use is a funnel you can stick it in the end of the cone paper and it'll make it packing a little easier I usually don't use it but you know there's the option if you want it so they'll get this thing packed up you just want to make sure that when you're packing the cone joint that you pack it as you go don't pack a whole bunch in there and then pack it down that is gonna cause your joint to run like crazy believe me or another thing that that causes is for your joint just to completely go out get that thing fully packed keep tamping it down as you go and actually one thing I'll show you the best way to do this it's a little bit more difficult is to actually put the paper on backwards I'll show you about that well yeah so that's a nice little personal conjoint here not a big ol fatty but if you want to you just roll your paper higher up on here and it's a fatter cone automatically I'll demonstrate it for you after I get this one packed this is going to be a nice postpone for me 27.4 7% and it shows to lots of trichomes covering this bad boy let's see when you get to the end just kind of cup your fingers around it like this and then you can just punch down on it real easy nothing difficult here that's for sure hands are just covered in this stuff all right so here we have it conjoint not sure how much this weighs that is about point nine grams so let's assume that the paper and the cardboard weigh about what point two or something because I only used a very little bit of it so it's like a point seven gram Joey that's pretty good it's packed in there nice and tight draws really well I can feel that now let me just demonstrate for you real quick before I get this choked up let me demonstrate how if you you lit up higher you get a bigger cone out of it so before I match the bottom here this time I'm not gonna do that I'm gonna roll it further up here you just lick it again same as before here we got the cone and you see how much fatter this one is so there you go if you roll it up even higher you're gonna get an even fatter one and I think it would be funny to make a really fat mold where it's just like boom you can pack yourself some really crazy ones and on these if you just if it has a bigger tip right here you'll just cut off a little bit more of one of these filter papers there we go pretty cool way to save yourself some money this will work well if there's any of those shake deals out there in your area or whatever there you go alright now before I light that join up let me show you how to back roll back roll look hold let me show you how to back roll a cone joint so you take the paper and you see oh here's the sticky side you put it on backwards so we're gonna be doing the sticky side is gonna be outwards so you see this I don't know if you can see that here's the sticky side okay so you take it and roll it like normal except that you get it into place like this and then you moisten it before you roll it up and now you just roll it and continue to moisten it as you go okay and so you're rolling rolling rolling rolling now it's rolled on there and it's stuck together right and you have all this extra paper hanging off what do you do what do you do indeed you find my lighter and I'll show you what to do you take it and you light it I went ahead and looked it one more time just to make sure that it's sealed before I do this let's say you take the lighter you just catch it on fire and let it burn hold it up so it doesn't really burn there you go and now you have a back rolled cone here right now what is the advantage of this well it's not a well okay first of all there's a lot less paper on this on a back roll but the other advantage is specifically for cone joints if you look in here you see how there's that paper right here this is a pain in the butt if you're packing a cone joint if you look in the middle sorry these are really delicate until you get that cardboard in and if you look down the middle of these they don't have anything in the middle so they're really easy to pack so that's why you would do a back roll cone joint very cool huh they're a little bit more delicate they're gonna have a way better flavor though because you're just cutting out that much more paper so well I'm about way better but you know they're gonna have a better flavor alright so let's get this lit and toked up no I'm definitely ready for it it's raining cats and dogs out there right now I'm pretty gloomy Saturday so no I could use the medication that's for sure so this is how you light the cone joint I guess I should have said that you just want to roll it around the end until the whole thing is lit you don't want to inhale the cone joint while the flame is on it because it will make it run like crazy this won't prevent it from running but it discourages running by lighting it even leaf alright there we have a nice DIY cone joy at home see if we can toke it without it running all over the place get all this jakey stuff out of the way those always come in handy huh sure plenty of people have used those at a pinch or two yes that ashtray is not all that interesting really it's burning pretty nicely um flavors pretty darn good as far as today this morning I probably had the most flavorful joint I've ever had it was of citrus farmer and that grapefruit flavor just came right through I mean I got all excited because key relief is I'm gonna sail and then I saw that all their flowers in store only that was a bummer vitae kids have it a sale it doesn't include flower hey these guys need to get with the times there's like half of the patients went straight to flower smokeable flower as soon as it was available I should tell you something so you know we're gonna bind and you don't have that's what I normally use like packs of these papers or I'll show you these cones pre-rolled cones like this it's just convenient but you know if you need to you can make them yourself at home save you a little money or if you're just did a pitcher you go have around party bays there you go never be without your cones woods you also roll my hand I'll have to show you a hand roll come join those aren't as good at least mine are a lot better with that mold there before my guess I don't know what you call it coffee stuff all over the place really feeling the effects of this ebony and ivory Sookie fee you can really tell it's a 20/20 7.47 presented man so uh anybody else out there roll your own cone joints been doing it for a while I actually started out not with doing cones but just for the longest time I would just put filters on my joints man that would be interesting actually if I did an evolution video of my evolution of joint rolling because I have a very distinct evolution of what I've been through you know really crappy crappy hand roll joints you know with no filter anything you could barely talk out of that clog up on end to I would put for a long time I put really small filter tips in for a long time after that I would put in bigger filter tips that I started trying to do cones never really did get big in two blunts but there have been times when I did you know rolling once man oh man as you can see is burning really nicely that's another thing you can make sure that you know there's a lot of complaints of pre-roll of cones running really badly we'll get good and then you don't have to have them roll all right I'll be running good you get good they won't run a lot of it also has to do with the grinder you want a nice even grind people say that it's bad to have a fine grind but it's really not is that bad nope you just gotta pack it correctly I like this a lot this is just a metal dab tool you can probably get it for five or ten bucks at any head shop all right but let me tell you what makes a good packing tool for these things so what makes a good packing tool is it for it to have some diameter to it like this you know it'd be a little bit heavy so that you can let the weight of it do the work so when I'm packing I'm not really pushing too much as much as letting it drop maybe having a little bit of pressure add to it with the fact that this is heavy and metal really helps that the other thing I like is for there to be a smaller tip I'm still a flat end you know I want it to be flat on the end still but a little bit smaller on the tip than it is in the main part because this helps it this packs it down and then if there's gaps in the edges you could turn it around the edges like this and it'll pack around the edges you could also just make another one of these if you're out of everything but paper just make another one of this but roll it so tight that there's not really a hole in the end you can just pinch the end I guess and use that to pack it I think I'm gonna make a video next couple days where I show all the different ways I can roll a joint gonna be cool and there's a lot of people out there just come in to cannabis now that it's legal I think that's really cool I think it's an awesome thing you know there's so many people have been missing out for years and welcome right so I think it's really cool who would people discover something like cannabis it really helps improve their life and can really you know help with problems that otherwise might require harsh drugs or you know have really bad side effects from those drugs and that kind of thing as cannabis you know we've been using that for longest time as a medicine we know pretty much the side effects and stuff nothing too crazy with it I know that cannabis has helped me with my PTSD so much and I only wish that it had been legal earlier because that stigma really really hurt for years I mean if you already have PTSD and you wake up with nightmares and many a paranoia it's just made so much worse when you think that your medicine is gonna make you go to prison you know I mean man I did the mixed messages you know it works you don't makes you feel so much better but everyone in the society tells you how evil it is and you're breaking the law and man that's why I'm just so glad that we have a medical system here in Florida no don't have to feel like a criminal for doing something that's totally fine it's solely wholesome there's nothing wrong with cannabis you know it's like saying there's you know milk is terrible no looks not terrible it's just you just got to use it in moderation not not drink milk at every freakin meal and for snacks and you know same kind of deal oh man sorry you're pretty harsh at the end here see I wonder how much THC that is 192 milligrams it looks like THC very interesting so well guys I think I'm done until there we go roll your own pre-roll conjoint at home well just you rolled it it's not pretty rolled using a few simple things you probably got around your house anyway and there you go so hopefully you can save yourself a little bit money make your own pretty rolls own thank you very much for watching y'all have a good", "JvmkaiMNW-U": "today we're going to be reviewing the $4 one grand prix roll

center plate and this is the lower plate slides right on sets down we're going to use a 109 cones all our materials have been classified through the screen now we're going to lay our material because we know we have three hundred and twenty four cones all one gram so we're going to weigh out 324 grams dropping our cones in of it dropping our cones we've already adjusted therefore the height for raw cones if you have another manufacturer you can use you can raise it or lower it to cut the cones properly and you got allen wrench and we use that with the helen wrench so just the height right here at all four corners all four corners and then they and they just drop straight in yeah just drop the cone just like you normally would and any other cone filling machine the boring part okay we're going to spread our material in in the holes to fill up to one gram of material [Music] to see any stems falling off now we have all the material in the holes that's all should weigh about a gram in each hole I'll vibrate a little bit okay now we should slide off your your Center plate you just vibrate it and all the material will go down into each [Music] [Music] and you can take off your top play all your tones are full pick up your plate send it down on something flat and all the cones pop up we're ready to roll even quest Thanks nice tight joint each one of these rolled cones weigh just the right amount zero three that's what's that's alright which one yeah also it's that's our machine apart from everybody else's I should control the weight on point three clean zero three nice hey stop bargain we're doing a video getting towards the end getting towards the end and stacking it up stacking them up yeah we just rolled 324 tones took us about 45 rock just west of Mars say

contamination place your vibration table stabilization mat on the surface you will be working off place the vibration table on the stabilization map plug the extension cord into the wall outlet plug the vibration table into the extension cord place the cone filling machine on top of the vibration table set the cone riser aside for now load your cone filling machine with empty cones [Music] grab the material that you will be filling your cones with today we are using menthol meadow an herbal smoking blend from herbal spirits use the switch on the extension cable to turn the vibration table on once your vibration table has turned on begin filling the machine with your material the vibration action of the machine will shake your material into the cones use the included cone packing tool to pack the cones while the vibration table is off continue filling the Machine and packing until the cones are full once the cones are full turn the vibration table off using the switch on the extension cord place the cone filling machine with the cone riser underneath it on a flat surface rotate the cone filling machines while lightly applying downward pressure on the riser the machine will eventually slide down on top of the riser while simultaneously lifting the filled cones remove each cone from the machine fold and twist the end to finish [Music] congratulations you have just used a

have to give them a huge shout out right because they're people there are just so and also so friendly customer service times 10 they walked us through all of their products and I told them kind of like what we were looking for she gave me a really awesome breakdown of basically all of their products especially after I told her that you were doing educational research she let me take a couple pictures so you're gonna see that up on the Block soon right yeah this is their logo Colorado but yeah this video is going to be all about caviar pre-rolls it is a hybrid this one specifically I love the packaging it's a hybrid and let's see what it says here show you a little bit more detail so flour and hash so like I said it comes in this packaging you squeeze on the side it opens up like that and what I really like about this pre-roll not only is the packaging pretty nice but check this out so pre-roll I mean it's pretty rolled for you but look at this like smoking tip it's like so what sexy as you can see that there you go it has the caviar logo it's made out of glass super easy to pull from the paper is basically the raw rolling paper and my personal favorite um and yeah so we decided to go with the hybrid and it's funny actually the way that that happened it's because they had one that was the team that had three so they had a hybrid they had a sativa and an indica so she basically looked at us and was like well I know you like sativa and then you like indica so then we looked at each other like oh [ __ ] which one are we gonna get right so she's like how about you meet in the middle and compromise so we got a hybrid so we're gonna go some off this bad boy we're gonna do the stat test on it so you'll see that on the blog as well and we'll keep you posted", "O9kBd_cleAc": "hey what's good everybody j ping here checking in respectmyregion.com here today to do a quick taste test pre-roll review featuring the hammerhead infused pre-roll a group out of san pedro long beach california uh man we've i'm personally really excited to check this out i've been hearing a lot of great things um we're looking at a product that has quality cannabis in terms of flour there are premium diamonds sprinkled out throughout this blunt i'm sorry throughout this joint there is distillate and on the outside has been coated and then it was coated in keef as well and then they do a strain or botanical natural terpene specific uh kind of um blend i guess i would say depending on the flavor that they're going for and so this is the og uh og kush flavor og kush strain flour and then og natural terpenes and so i'm excited to check it out the packaging is something i'm a big fan of i really like the aquatic underwater vibe the hammerhead the logo is super dope they have the little view here on the box of what's inside the joint testing wise 26.89 on the thc 31.47 on the total cannabinoids so this is definitely potent distributed by sea bright farms so here we go we've got cardboard box plastic dupe tube joint smells good inside oh it is definitely covered in keefe y'all check this out that is one hell of a good looking infused joint right there all right the dry hit is delicious i'm gonna massage it out just a little bit infused joints sometimes can be packed pretty tight and it makes for a troublesome smoke so always important to make sure you come ready with these um premium products all right here we go you guys see the light make sure when you're lighting your joints yo you guys got to be twisting it you want to make sure you get an even burn all the way around the joint there you go and then you got to give it a couple rips and look at that a nice good even burn here i'll show you wow wow this tastes really good so i was telling the hammerhead team like yo you know i try the fuzzies i try the jeters i try all these different you know infused joints that are out there i remember all the infused ones back in seattle big shout out to all the infused companies you know all over doing joints but the fact remains is that keef and distillate makes this a harsher product and so if you have good tasting flour and the diamonds the dusty the terps whatever it is you're adding to it you're infusing it with is that if that can complement your flour then you've got it and from what i'm tasting so far this is complementing everything oh yeah i would smoke these all the time for sure feels like i'm smoking a blunt that i like or a fat ass joint that i rolled myself and then coated myself and then dipped myself i love it this is dope this is dope when i think of a score out of 10 in terms of flavor i think of a 98 99 out of 100 the only thing i don't want in this product is natural terpenes i want cannabis terps if this had some fire og terps from cannabis only in this this [ __ ] would be way more potent than it is but it's already good so i'm going to give it a 98 instead of a 99 just for that reason in terms of the overall score i'm going to give it a 90 a 98 as well because i still want cannabis terps cannabis only everything on this product and this makes it a perfect product this is going to be one of the best products on the entire west coast we tour taste test reviews everything this is just wow wow wow wow nice [ __ ] work hammerhead hell yeah let me know what you guys think if you guys have had the og kush if you had the og hammerhead infused pre-roll in the past please be sure to drop a comment let me know what you think let the other people know what you think uh if you haven't yet let us

ash on the top done love you guys peace", "Z_dZUQPzJus": "hi everyone today I'm gonna show you about the comb packer 300 I'm gonna show you the parts that come with a machine how to put the machine together how to pack pre-rolls with this machine and how to optimize your process to create high-quality approvals [Music] your machine will come with a vibrating base this includes also a real step motor this allows you to control the vibrational power of the machine under this catchment tray you'll see a vibrating motor attached to the bottom of it it'll come with two holding trays we have one here and one down here it will come with a metering tray and two metering masks these metering masks allow you to change the height of the metering tray and this effectively changes the volumetric filling that you feel per run so this is your metering tray this is the part that you fill with the cannabis and you meter out the amount of cannabis you'd want to put into the pre-rolls this metering tray holds about 0.25 grams underneath this we have the filling tray or loading tray this is where we'll load the cones into and then we'll put the metering tray on top of there I'll show you fully how to put this machine together in just a second okay first things first is right here we'll plug this into the rheostat so there's an outlet right here that we could plug into and we won't plug this into the power yet but we'll put this down you'll want to take one of your holding trays you'll want to take one of your holding trays and place it over this catchment tray and you'll want to make sure that you have it oriented the right way the next step is then to install the loading tray over that and then we will put the metering tray into the machine right here and again there is an orientation so that you can slide the metering tray back and forth to open the holes and release the material into the pre-rolled accounts so now we'll finally plug this into the power like so and we'll just want to make sure the r\u00edos is off before we do that and you'll see that the vibrating motor does so that our machine is fully set up and ready for packing okay now the fun part I'm going to show you guys how to pack pre rolls with this machine so first things first is you're gonna want to remove this metering tray before you load any cones and then you're gonna do want to do one more step before you load cones you're gonna want to lift these handles up so that you have the proper amount of height to fill the cones with okay now I'm just gonna start filling some cones here there's 300 holes in this machine so you can fill 300 cones into the machine and I just grab a stack of cones and I just start dropping them in one by one so now that you've filled all your pre rolls into the individual holes the next step is to take your metering tray and install it on the top [Music] now as you remember before this metering tray slides back and forth in an open position and then in a closed position so we run it in the closed position so that we can fill all these holes with cannabis so I'm gonna pull out the cannabis that we've already ground and we ground this in our industrial grinder [Music] and what we're gonna do here is we're just gonna pour it this cannabis material in top and fill each hole so we're just gonna spread around the cannabis to make sure that each hole gets filled okay so now that all your holes have been evenly filled with cannabis we want to make sure that it's very even otherwise we'll get very different weights so we'll just do a final spread here to make sure it's better to overfill a little bit than to under fill and then next what we'll do is before we run any vibration will open the metering tray and allow the material to fall through what we'll want to do is we'll want to give it a couple smacks so that the material really does fall through [Music] [Music] and then we will lift the metering tray off here set it aside and then what we will do is we will lift up the cones and then we'll run the vibration so when you start the vibration on this machine first of all you're going to want to start it on the lowest setting and you're going to want to make sure that you turn it on to variable and not full so when you start on the lowest setting and you turn it on to variable you're gonna want to run on this setting for about thirty seconds then when you turn it up you may want to run it on a higher setting for about fifteen seconds and then turn it up a little bit more maybe run it on that sitting for five seconds and then you're gonna want to turn it back down maybe do a final pack it's all really gonna depend on your strain and your grind and how your material feels what kind of moisture content does it have I was sticky is it so we're really gonna have to optimize this variable control based on your specific process and your specific strains so this is gonna take a bit of testing and development but that's really the beauty of this machine is that you are fully in control alright so now that we've run our packing regime on our pee rules what we're gonna do here now is we're gonna want to lift these pre rolls out of the machine so first step is to first lower these pre rolls back down if we see any pre rolls that stick out we just give them a gentle push down with our palm of our hand okay now we will lift up this loading tray we can lift up the holding tray bring it to the side and we can start weighing twisting and packaging or pre rolls [Music] all right so we've tested a couple dozen pre-rolls here and now these are nice little quarter Grand Prix rolls perfect for a little solo session and so I'll just set these to the side for now and one of the nice things about this machine is while you have your other employees you know twisting weighing and packaging these pre rolls we have another holding tray so that another employee can get right back to filling and as you know since twisting and weighing takes the most time you want the most hands on this part while you just have one person maybe operating the Machine and since this machine is a square you can have four people around this tray you know twisting weighing so you can have a lot of people on the back end operation of the weighing the twisting and the packaging and just have one person operating this machine and another nice thing is once we're done here and we want to clean up we can just remove this catchment tray gather all our excess material and put it just right back into our bucket here and we can do that same thing with the other parts of the machine and this machine is super easy to clean it's totally compatible with isopropyl or if you just want to use some dawn liquid soap and water that works as well you can access the bottom by lifting this up so you can clean out and you resin or material that fell through there and you can just use a little brush to clean each one of these holes if you need to and so this is a super durable machine it's made with high quality plastics it's very durable if this machine gets dropped and in fact this one did get drunk and there's just the tiniest of dents right there that's the only damage that happened when we dropped this little piece right here and so I hope you guys enjoy the machine if you have any questions or want more

looking at a king for machine yeah szybko as well both tops come with the unit itself this unit is adjustable speed you could decide how much you want to pack it okay units the American name as a one-year warranty or material access to Utah to the top Wow that we show them here it is a modular units in any part that you break you could replace fine you don't have to buy them I'll hold it tight how much does one of these cost or two not it up what what do you do when when you got one how to show me can you show me how it works here's one that's already hooked up right so let's take it back here okay you put in here cause in here either you decide if it's all on record or working ok put material on top and then you turn it on a more compact way you can pack the bottom up about a minute then you stop it you add more material once you add more with you a little bit about four minutes after four minutes you have a bottle of O 16 a perfectly packed own paper about 100 others 69 Wow take

"okay cool today in the name of what's in my pre-roll we've got this one gram banana bread highlight from cookies uh so i was at strabinski's on fairfax the other day picking up a couple of their pre-rolls and i figured might as well grab one of these too and take advantage of that first time discount so yeah that's why this is here so let's go ahead and take a look so yeah this is the banana bread as i said one gram let me zoom in here on these deets so it looks like this is testing out to 22.21 percent and let's see produced on 11 14 19 all right a little old package on 12 11 19 so yeah not exactly new uh well we're at now about eight months from the time it was packed so not great not great but uh you know that's going to happen these things hang out on the shelves for a while probably depending on where you're at and you know scherbinski's people are probably there for surbinsky's stuff but in any case let me go ahead get this plastic open and we'll take a look and this was coming in at just over 20 dollars after tax as well i believe so that's where we're at and there we go let's take a look there's the cookies crutch get a little bit of a zoom in there we are all right cool so let's do a little crutch check here a little weak not unexpected with a bunch of pre-packages sorry i'm trying to be cognizant of the light here i realize it's not the best we try to get some light over here too maybe that'll help a little bit i rearranged this workstation though so all right in any case let me go ahead and double check that crutch is what it is let me go ahead and get a pool not a lot of flavor i do get a little bit of a sweet fruitiness maybe i could get banana bread but yeah no i'd say it's a a subtle seat sweet fruitiness probably is the the best i'm getting out of there and i mean it's kind of old so what can i expect but all right let me go ahead and get this out of the way i'll start chopping this guy open i'm not familiar with a lot of cookie stuff so i can't say exactly how this is supposed to smell but i would hope it looks and smells good even though rep so let's see what's up with this as i slice down to the bottom there all right let's go ahead and get this out and we can take a look together not looking too bad looking all right a deuce by tiny passenger at least i felt one just now passed by my thumb let me get this into some better focus for you guys hold on just trying to get everything out there there we go all right cool so that seems to be pretty much the contents there flatten it out there we go see what's in front here yeah not looking too bad uh it's ground down pretty hard and i'm coming across a lot of hard little bits in here but yeah that's not unusual for things that have been packed in mass and if we do find anything on kooth in here anything suspect i would say that's also not unusual because you know nobody's going through this material like i am but honestly it doesn't look too bad i do see if i were to get really particular this guy right here for example so that it's a little bit just a tiny bit of stem but i mean you know you guys are seeing it like i'm seeing it i could probably go through i don't want to cover him up could go through this stuff a little more but yeah i'm just trying to stay out of the light there but yeah i'm not really feeling or seeing anything that was probably what i felt as it was coming out so yeah not looking too bad looking pretty decent again it is really ground down it's really finely ground so wait here is a cousin of his i just felt in my oh there we go as i was trying to get a sniff on the grinds i just felt that so yeah i mean you know this is uh me feeling really particular here though it's uh nothing unusual there's nothing suspect about this it smells all right it's got a mintiness to it that's what i'm picking up mostly like a sweet mint on the grinds themselves so yeah no i'm definitely going to smoke this doesn't look half bad at all so yeah this material definitely gets a pass it's a little old it probably smelled better back in the day but it doesn't smell too bad now so all right let me just go ahead and prep the scale get you guys over there hold on oh well let's take it a little bit longer than usual but i'll move you guys over here it looks like it's tearing out now all right there we go zooming back put this on here and man that's making it hard to see for you guys let me zoom in on that again and where could where's the best view right there all right cool let me zero this out and as long as this comes up to a g we're good i mean again it was over 20 bucks out the door so i mean make your decision on that as you will oh yeah i forgot to mention my skill is off by a point i should have said that earlier uh so if anything that weighs out 0.9 or above gets a pass so this is a technical pass not a very generous way it's probably coming up right on a g i got a little bit of dust in here maybe a just had its way with it too but i'm gonna give that a pass that's fine uh because it's not hell under and again i blame my scale for being a point under some yeah i don't know if you're happy with that for a little bit more than 20 bucks out the door then go for it but that's what's inside it gets a pass from me i just yeah i'm not sure about the price point of these j is 20 bucks i mean maybe this will smoke awesomely and we'll see but uh nothing bad about it so yeah if you can get it at a price you're comfortable with i say go for it this gets a pass good job cookies a pass is in a passing grade not as i'm passing on it i guess i gotta find another term to use but this gets a thumbs up all right there we go", "W-C21MCmjZI": "designed to maximize pre-rolled joint production while significantly

nonetheless this is OG cam coming in at 23 percent THC with thawing 0.18 percent of CBD and then it's got two point fifty three percent on the terpenes alright I don't think it's got really anything else in it not really alright so I picked this up at green to go in Finley Washington this is a legal Washington product again this is by fat Panda this is the second joint that I've reviewed by fat Panda the first one didn't get so good of reviews now I know what some people might be post in the comment section well your last review you gave them bad reviews and I like fat Panda joints they're pretty damn joints and dadada I've had good fat Panda joints okay I'm not gonna say that all of them are [ __ ] that's not what these review videos are about okay they're not saying hey this company [ __ ] don't buy this company okay my review videos are for the individual products not the companies the products okay so if one joint didn't score to higher didn't score to well doesn't mean that this one won't okay it just all depends on the product to be honest it just did that's all it depends on so we're gonna go ahead and pop that top take the seal off show you guys it's not been opened or tampered with there we go and we're all right and there is our joint they're using the raw papers with the rock crutch they got their logo right there I'm gonna try to make this review video on this joint a little faster than the other one I know the other one was like 10 minutes I'm gonna try to speed it up on this one so what we're gonna be basing this review on is how well does it smoke does it run does it you know suck at hitting and we're also going to be reviewing the flower of course inside it does it taste good as a bottom-of-the-barrel shake you know what I mean a lot of joints are bottom of the barrel shake to be to be very you know Frank like even if a company says it snugs and buds and premium cannabis it's [ __ ] okay a lot of the times 90% of the time that's not that it's usually bottom of the jar shake whatever sweet leaf that's falling off stuff like that okay nonetheless I'm gonna give this one a try this is the og Kim I have had the flower version of this it not in the joint and I loved it I absolutely loved it it tastes amazing the Turks were great now this you can smell it it actually smells pretty good you can smell that og cabinet ya know you can smell it it smells really good it's definitely got that og Kim to it so let's light it on up guys much love thank you for watching my video you guys are all [ __ ] awesome [Music] oh that pretty good so far I mean that's just the first hit but [ __ ] damn no that tastes pretty good it's got a nice nice burn so far - it tastes really good definitely got that you know chemi OG taste to it I really enjoy that that diesel chem eNOS to it and I like that I like that I like that a lot gives nice hits this one doesn't seem like it was packed bad this one seems like it was packed fairly even nice doesn't taste bad that's a good day to do it it really does so for recreational I paid about seven dollars for this joint it's a 1 gram joint king size and of course medical will get it cheaper than that and I have to say I do recommend this og camp I have to say I do recommend this OGG episode you kids pretty good I really like it I really dig it I do it's got so far it's burning really nice it's got a nice even burn to it and I like it when joints have that that's one of the main reasons the joints are a turn-off for me that and how fast they smoke you know what a blunt does last longer I'm more of a blunt person myself but I do like joints there are also a lot healthier for you than blunts are so let's give it a good rip no bear I would definitely recommend this so if you're looking for like a pre-roll product and you don't mind paying $7 this og came by fat Panda is something I would definitely give a thumbs up to I would definitely recommend okay because because I like it tastes great it's got a nice height to it it's got a nice body high to it like a nice like I feel great you know what I mean nice and relaxed and just I mean overall it's great like I I was really I thought it was gonna be like bottom of the barrel shake nastiness but it tastes great it's got a nice height to it it's burning well nice and even they packed it good so love you know what you guys think about the

the biggest joint i've ever gutted i'm not sure how i'm going to deal with that i have some ideas hopefully this all pans out but yeah let's go ahead and just jump into it if you're watching this on my patreon page thanks a lot i appreciate you being a patron it means a lot because this thing was [ __ ] expensive sorry to use some foul language there but uh yeah it was 150 on the menu pre-tax uh so thank you to tropicana for making this happen giving me that 15 discount got me out the door under two bills but still very expensive nonetheless uh but yeah let's take a look at this tag cause i'm interested in what we're gonna find here um so we've got eight g's it says seven g's of originals indoor flower and 1g of live resin and it says lift tickets infused rolling paper so i guess there is a g of live resin mixed in with the flower we'll find out together um and then also lift tickets are infused so that's like more live resin in those papers so in any case that's what's going on here with this label let's see if there's what's on the back okay this is the actual testing panel here just came right off that pin and this is what we got in here so 28 to total thc and it does say 7g a flower 1g of extract southwest caregivers here and when was it made back on 8 26 so not too long ago were just coming up towards the end of september now it's about the 20th um so yeah not too old just under a month about so interesting let's see originals og rolling paper by lift tickets so that i don't know we're going to find out together but that makes me wonder is the live resin just what's in the paper because lift tickets is you know it says rolling paper and then flower by but doesn't say concentrates by so oh but wait oh oh ingredients never mind hold on cannabis flour cannabis extract live resin diamonds cannabis extract live resin infused rolling paper alright so that answers my question of course there's the government uh warning they're always watching um so yeah we should find some diamonds in here as well as the flower and then of course the rolling paper is infused so maybe i'll be able to save some of that maybe not looks like quite a bit of cb oh never mind i was reading that wrong i thought it was 11 cbd i was like wow that's a lot but uh point one four five percent cbd so not too much compared to the thc in any case let's get into it and see what's good i'll take this tag i'll put it over here i'll move my sticker because i imagine there's going to be a lot of flour coming out and so this is it let me zoom out you don't need to be that close this is the pin here is the seal so you see you have the official napalm seal um and yeah i mean i think that's it i don't think i actually pull the pin that would be pretty cool but but i think i just twist this off so let's go ahead and watch the seal break together or if it yep there it goes and you can see that it's got that kind of amp anti-tamper seal stuff there stuck on the jar and here we go it's ready to come out let me zoom back out drum roll in your heads boom there it is damn this thing is huge uh definitely again the biggest pre-roll that i've ever gutted the surface looks a little strange just before i pull it apart i thought i'd zoom in on that and i do want to get a dry pool and not neglect that because there's no going back on this one and how the heck oh maybe you do have to pull the pin no i don't know maybe not do i just we're finding this out together i should have did it say pull pin on the instructions to use no no okay uh i don't want to break it but it doesn't it's like stuck in there what the [ __ ] hold on hold on here you get to see me mess with this thing and be a total idiot let me try to pull the pin no okay it doesn't work all right well it's in there it's stuck in there and it's like if you spend this much money on a j and you can't get it out of the cap like what the [ __ ] maybe i gotta unscrew it all right okay i'm just there we go okay i don't know what i did there i think that was my fault so pardon my retardation um pardon that my use of that because i can't erase it and we're live in this video so i'm sorry for saying that but yeah that was my fault i think i i feel like is this screwed in or what what what's going on here this looks like porcelain i should have probably read to see what this is made of but looks like a nice tip it smells great i gotta give that to the originals the uh i can smell the ogenus from back here so let me go ahead and get a dry pull on this real quick and it pulls just fine like i feel like if i lit this up it would smoke perfectly it's got that like really nice it's almost lemony it's like yeah definitely a lemony um maybe minorly gassy but i get more of a freshness off of it so it's like yeah but there's definitely a fuel in the taste too on it so i'm gonna enjoy smoking this flour for sure it's got a great taste classic og so maybe the originals you know i don't know it's it's it's definitely uh on point with a lot of very popular ogs i'm not gonna comment more than that but it tastes very good um all right so let's go ahead and get the right angle on this thing because there's no going back here we go with this here looks like this is where it was actually sealed together so here we go snip snip snip now this is a barrel and i really am curious about how they put these together because it's just like this big tube and i'm like is this you know i mean are these all made by hand hand packed most likely at least like do they cone these out at first how do they do it so let me see i'm going to try to actually cut down the middle here i'm going to try to preserve the paper as much as possible maybe i'll be able to roll it back into a j let me see oh there we go here we go i'm just going to open that up there it is there we go all right awesome well there it is it's coming out in a big old barrel because that's what it is in here all stuffed in oh man i don't want to lose any of this material so i'm going to be really careful as i pat it out of here come on now come on now come on now here it comes all right here we go is that no no i'll be honest i am on the lookout for seeds only because that is what i saw in another video where somebody had opened this up oh special k i just i'm glad the paper caught all that only one tiny tiny little piece managed to make its way off all right cool so the paper is pretty much intact i don't know if we'll see if we find any of those diamonds in here i don't know what they're supposed to look like this stuff smells so good though it's really awesome i definitely love the the smell i'm getting so let me go ahead and get more of a centered view here as i go through this it's a lot of material as i was saying i don't even want to breathe too hard because it'll just go everywhere um so let's see what we got in here already just a little passenger there so far now this is going to take a bit it's going to take a bit but i i don't uh don't see how where the diamonds are exactly and uh you know eventually um if napalm sees this video let me know what i'm looking for exactly because i'm not seeing it i'm seeing a lot of this though which i'm just suspect now because i've seen that other video special k i believe is the user that put that out and there are a lot of these little tiny looking pieces that like are not seeds because i keep smashing them and they go away they're just very suspect you know so but uh the material itself i mean i kind of like the grind it's not grounded down to nothing um so that's good it's got a good consistency it probably would have smoked pretty well but it does have the occasional passenger man it is just so hard to go through this much material though to be honest i probably should have put it in a rolling tray i think i think maybe these chunks i keep coming across might be something to do with the live resin i mean it doesn't feel sticky it doesn't feel like a concentrate by any means uh when i'm breaking them up but i'm just you know finding these little clusters in here and uh and yeah so i just want to be thorough this is probably gonna feel one of the longest joint videos also i hope my phone holds up uh heat wise because it tends to overheat but yeah i just keep seeing a lot of these little bits of things so i i think those might be the diamonds i don't know i can't say because it just feels like herb when i'm when i'm busting them down but they have a c like shape so it's very uh suspect in that way but not yeah not a lot of passengers really you know i mean i've come across a couple here so far there's just so much freaking material in here and so let's break it down you know we're talking about what 150 bucks pre-tax um so that's a quarter so and i mean you've got a g of live resin so i'm not sure what that goes for concentrate wise um but yeah breaking it down by its components what is what are a couple weights maybe like uh 80 bucks you know let's say 48 yet each right and then you get a g of live risen whatever that runs so this really isn't too bad considering that they constructed it also and i mean i am kind of going by more store prices pre-tax etc but uh but yeah i i wouldn't say it's necessarily super overpriced because there is something to do with this construction but as you can see it's not free of defect you know i mean there are a couple and i mean it's just so much too i'm used to just going through one gram so this is seven times the amount of material that i'm used to going through and it's like i can see as i'm doing it there isn't too many but there are just little tiny pieces that are suspect it's got a good consistency though i've really got to give it to that because yeah i'm sure this would have smoked awesomely um just the way that it's got a mix of like really finely ground stuff and uh and really big chunks in here and it just smells so good yeah it really does have that classic og scent sweetness to it um like the lemony citrusy sweetness with that fuel in there yeah i can't wait to smoke this stuff but uh and i just brushed those stems back in there so i mean i'm not seeing anything crazy i'm not seeing any seeds you know i mean that was the question after seeing the video that was released not too long ago would we find any seeds there's nothing sticking out at me you know and i'm checking as you can see i'm checking all these little bits as i'm coming across them but i really don't think we're going to find anything but i just want to be sure because yeah you can only make this video once and i mean you know yeah i have to say this looks pretty decent i came across a couple stems but you know stuff like this here there's gonna be there we go there's another one over here so i can pick these out you know and there's probably going to be a bunch more of them you know not not a supreme amount because i you know otherwise i would just be doing it right now but as i go through it i'm sure i could find more of that we found that bigger stem so there are some stems in here just a little bit nothing crazy again especially when you consider the price point you know and the and the work that goes into making something like this now i don't know what kind of material they started with maybe they get a good deal on lowers or whatever you know but uh yeah can't really see anything to complain about in here um but i'm not finding those uh we're gonna weigh this out right now so it comes out to eight g's they must be in here i guess like but i'm not seeing what i would suspect are the live resin diamonds or whatever so anyway i'm getting a notice that my phone is getting hot so i better move along and get this weight off uh because this is again a really long video um so let's go ahead and get the scale going i'll move you guys over there here we go all righty and there it is and you can see that pretty good from right there so let me tear this out yeah i'm gonna try to corral all of this material in here it is again more than i've weighed out before so i'm hoping this all stays in here be cooperative here we go oh all right so there's some left on the paper coming up to 7.7 and i did there's a couple crumbs out here but not a whole lot so that is what the weight is coming up to you now if it's supposed to be not including the paper then so be it uh it's going to be kind of a pain to pull this paper off i think oh let me try it hold on i want to give it away just to see if it comes up to at least here we go here we go all right i'm throwing the paper into two so you", "3yFmhXi894A": "in Vegas I Stephanie what cool guy she thought of me would see right underneath said I can't

with a west coast weed tour review got the homie today can of escapes how's it going everybody and we're going to be reviewing napalm cannabis company the grenade check that out man absolutely incredible um one of the most premium luxurious over the top above and beyond items in the entire cannabis industry this is the flex piece of all flex pieces in the pre-roll category can you guys can you guys zoom in on this real quick i want them i want them to see can you guys zoom in on this real quick check this out oh my gosh so today's item that we have is the blue tommies from uh the grenade xxl infused pre-roll seven grand premium indoor flower one gram live resin lift tickets rolling lift tickets infused rolling paper which is a live resin rolling paper have you ever tried that before it's incredible and then a ceramic tip it says the backpack boys times five points los angeles it's that elite [ __ ] man are you ready you put this in your hand feel the grenade in your hand feel that i've seen these for a while and i i did not think that i was going to smoke one so this is a this is a fun surprise and it's it's been quite a minute since i was actually intimidated by uh getting ready to consume intimidated is the word i do here it's intimidating i hear that from the bud tenders people are a little bit intimidated by the price point but when you talk about luxury items the best of the best the best some of the best flour exotic collaborations look at this grenade it's quite literally a grenade there's a pin there's this handle super cool i don't know if you guys can see this but they're the the uh the little fire emoji emblem that they have is right there on the glass it's it's insane so we're gonna jump right in we're going to keep it keep it consistent with the west coast we tour we're going to hit it once talk about it we're going to hit it twice we're going to give it a 4 out of 10. um you're supposed to smoke this all the way through we are going to put this out after a couple hits after we talk about it uh and then i'll dive in because no most people are gonna put this out unless they are fully prepared to smoke 200 which we might have to do it are you ready yeah all right let's let me let's let's let's get it rolling three and a half grams of flour how do i see you pull the pin you pull this out i don't i didn't pull if you have to pull yeah yeah very easily without the engineering packaging i'd be impressed oh yeah you just twisted them out that's pretty cool okay so we've got this eight gram monster here check this out you guys oh wait lift ticket paper that's it lift it we'll have to look that up wow it's gonna be dope it's gonna be dope i'm pretty excited all right you guys we got the torch i'm gonna massage it out just a little bit i do hear the general feedback is that these canoes so we will have to find out let's dry hit figure out dry head is smooth and creamy uh was there a strain oh the blue tummies all right here we go [Music] we got too much all right here we go nothing yet let's try to just try it with a little bit of a lighter all right so i can tell you right off the bat it's tough to hit the airflow is really good on it though it's not like it's too tight it's nothing to do with that i definitely rips through super nice that ceramic tip that's the nicest mouthpiece on anything i've ever smoked without a doubt it's very easy to rip the flavor is super creamy tiny little bit of gas and i'm getting a tiny little bit of berry like tiny little bits of like blueberry or maybe blackberry or whatever it is i don't know just berries so [ __ ] curious right it's pretty heavy it's large a lot of flavor to it when it comes to the flour again it's the blue tommies you got one gram of live resin the lift ticket infused rolling paper and the ceramic tip super delicious product i'm not sure as to the genetics of the blue tommies i'm not sure on the tripping profile on that i do wish that was included on here um the lift ticket information would love would love to know the stream for the live resin on that but we could probably look this up on their instagram or something um overall i think it's a delicious experience super heavy definitely like you mentioned the weight it's a solid super solid the the branding and the product appeal off the charts um this group napalm with exhibit you know they just really went above and beyond to deliver truly a premium experience kind of redefining the pre-roll category it is a pre-roll joint rolling papers infused rolling papers live resin seven grand premium indoor flower and it rips we did hear rumors of it kind of canoeing on some people at least i've heard that from multiple sources uh but this is honestly smoking pretty much perfectly yeah i'm um i'm actually impressed by how it smokes because that's how you light it though well definitely how you light it's going to control a lot of it but in terms of i thought it would be like an overpowering smoke yeah that it would really hit not harsh no not at all no like it actually i guess delicious the amount of wheat in there does a nice job of filtering the smoke as it comes down yeah absolutely um yeah i think that ceramic tip too super smooth just to just like i wonder what else could you re-roll with the ceramic tip though i think i'm definitely going to keep this running tip i'm going to see if we're able to kind of clean it and reuse it i don't know about my rolling abilities to roll another one i don't think i have it in me to roll any grammar that's for sure that's the i mean for for me with the the packaging i love this because it's that this is the child resistance resistant piece um i'd be curious as to how airtight it is i'm sure it's pretty airtight but you could put weed in here oh yeah definitely reuse it here just to show the people to reuse this as as the stash jar for your weed uh a great grenade glass and you guys can see the flame right there on the front and that's not just like a random jar that they got repurposed they had to get this jar custom-made that's dope that i i'm usually gonna look for for reasons to to dislike packaging for for waste related reasons but this is cool enough to keep so it goes into that category you can do a lot with this not just put weed in it like it's a do you have a tournament or some [ __ ] do you have a score in mind out of 10 for this review because i am extremely impressed with this the price obviously you know it's a product in its own category on the on the category i'm gonna from for my sport it's gonna be relative to other pre-rolls uh and i'm not gonna consider cost because you know when you're when you're getting a piece like that that's getting that [ __ ] piece yeah yeah um and for that reason i'm going to give that a eight eight five eight point five eight point five on it okay i'm surprised myself that i would give it that type of score with again this is without knowing much about the flower but in terms of the harshness of the smoke blue tommy's flower seven grand premium indoor from the backpack boys is that bay area hype [ __ ] right is [Music] i think i think backpack boys are la boys is is bae oh so i'm confusing the two i i might be confusing the two this is let us know we don't know this is that but like no i think i think that that's an la outfit i [ __ ] i'll [ __ ] with it man i think this is some of the best the best i've smoked the lyric hannah gars i've smoked i've smoked 10 of those zero cannagars the biggest of the biggest the ounces the small 12 grammers the small ones the the the seven grammars i believe is what uh the smallest one i think some something like that this is incredible here's here's what i'll say about this so she's probably my my highest cost on a quarterly to perhaps buy monthly occasion i would pay retail for this that's impressive that that's uh for the writing for the right occasion for the right group for the right reason to to celebrate this is a nice piece for that my score out of 10 out of 100 i'll respect my recent website i'm coming in at 9.2 and it's the same issues that i typically have would love to know more about the genetics we'd love to have a terpene profile on there it just really helps to cement the the experience you're about to have as a consumer as a customer we're paying good money for for just weed in general at this point and the consumer we want to know what we're about to experience flavor wise taste wise high wise and i know that can sometimes be a lot to ask for but there's so much going on on this product and there's a nice beautiful empty space in the back of the tag that it would have been huge maybe that's where they put like the sticker in the testing results well but there's two spots one one we could go qr code on there yeah i'm always with a qr code i'm looking at this and you could have they could put a nice insert in here yeah yeah because all that's sitting in there is the is the piece which you don't need to see anyway i mean i couldn't really tell what it looked like until i took it out anyway and i couldn't even add to the allure perhaps this is a free game for dave paul and for any packaging people or branding people creating a surprise when the product comes out that's a nice little uh endorphin rush for the consumer it's going to be memorable for that experience but also to so fill this with information about perhaps the farmer or the medium that it's grown in or the history of the company the people that are involved anything that you can associate to the story yeah yeah yeah i think that's fair too so like i said you know 9.25 for me more information on the story more information on the terpenes and the genetics and to them to me it's a perfect product regardless of the price point i think this is something that i would pay the money that for a couple times a year you know either as gifts or for myself uh i thoroughly enjoy it experience in itself the overall potency of this [ __ ] it's all fire it all tastes really good yeah i would uh i would love to find reasons to to hate on it but as it goes well we'll let you guys do the hating make sure you all type in respectmyregion.com let's go sweet tour me joey j ping here can of escapes we're doing the west coast we tour reviews shout out to

Rogers", "pSIE7Ua0bsQ": "all right y'all today i'm making a video on the alien labs graham demente i think that's how you say it and i'll be showing y'all how to get it 14 dollars out the door tony the tiger [Music] so just to start off i got this pre-roll from pcf um patient care first in series california so if you guys haven't seen my video make sure to go watch it it's me reviewing the cheapest dispensary in california and i believe this is the cheapest dispensary in california uh you could buy you know three of these payrolls 14 times three that's like what i don't know what's around there 30 40 50 bucks around there or you could buy an a for you know 72 bucks that's how much they sell it for my uh dispensary so uh i've been buying these lately and they're pretty [ __ ] good this is my third one i had ariel 41 cerbasio and now this creme de mente so um like i said this or i didn't say this cross is um cush mints and um cookies and cream so this puree is going to be testing at twenty three point five three percent thc and zero point zero five percent cpd this was packaged on six fifteen twenty today's seven twenty one twenty um it's a little bit old i guess you could say but not really i mean you're not gonna get some [ __ ] like three four days from the [ __ ] um packaging day or whatever so um let me open this for you guys it's going to have plastic but i took it off already let me show you guys the um the receipt real quick so you can see right there i got two alien laptops from my friend he paid around 30 bucks for him that's before tax and then you can see that single pre-roll was nine dollars and it came out to 14 dollars up the door and that's just some other stuff i bought but uh when you first get it there's gonna be plastic right here on the tip so you're just gonna wanna take that off i'm gonna pop it open so far this doesn't smell as potent as the other ones that i've had um especially that strabasio that was a very very uh smelly one they do it does smell different from them um and it does taste different from them but it doesn't taste um i'm not sorry it doesn't smell as potent and the taste from the dry hit um it's also not as potent but you could definitely taste um the different times i'm not gonna say any names with brands but sometimes brands like uh they just some of their heroes all taste the same they all smell the same i don't know what it is but so far from the three alien knight pupils i've had the all taste different then go outside so to spark it up i can show you guys some of the ash burning and i can give you guys my uh final thoughts on this and also let me know how much you guys get your alien lab one grand prix rolls for i played like i said fourteen dollars off the door nine dollars before tax yeah man comment down below make sure to keep being active and stuff to get me up there and get high with me make sure to get your make sure to get your joints ready make sure you get your you know if you have a rig make sure you get your rig ready make sure to take hits check out the video get high with me all right let's go outside i look sweaty because i just washed my car real quick decided to wash it before i before i smoked like you guys want to go see my whip then you guys know what this is almost with the camera look at this beauty huh e36 1996 my dad got that one and then she got this is mine you got one just like mine but black except this is a 530 mine's a 525 but look at my bumper though look at my bumper though sick huh yeah i got a new bumper let's get back to the [ __ ] hero show y'all that's right all right in lab crew if you all have watched my pre-roll videos before y'all know what this means and if you don't go back and watch my videos and you'll know what that noise means let me know if you guys want me to make a video where i break this joint down and see what's inside but for now taste how it smells first impression the ashes not bad compared to the other pre-rolls i've tasted though the others being area 41 and chewbacco i'll put this [ __ ] last the bartender wasn't wrong i guess he was telling me like uh he's saying it was it he was saying he was saying he said it was alright he said it wasn't his favorite because i uh i got area 41 and i got this one for my homie and then like last minute i just kept looking at the packaging and i was like oh hello curious so i got one for myself and that's when he had told me that but what i will say though about this one is it's a little little bit harsher [Music] we're not harsher but a little bit more hearts i'm gonna go ahead and finish this joint off [Music] okay so i made a video when i was outside i already finished smoking a joint obviously but uh i don't know i didn't like how the video came out to be honest i don't like how the video came out because my shirt was folded so i'ma just like some of what i said outside the flavor it was like not that good to be honest i thought it was gonna get better i was hoping it was gonna get better it didn't get better to me the flavor is like a six or six and a half excuse me i see what the guy was saying now he's like i don't really recommend it to be honest that was a [ __ ] man something new uh i don't recommend buying it if it's your first time getting in labs for sure um this is my third time buying asian labs [ __ ] you know try something new but uh i don't know i just really wouldn't recommend it at least like i said for the first time um for the high i think i gave it like a seven but honestly as i came inside [ __ ] and sat down the high kicked in for sure so i'm like kind of changing my mind about it i want to give it like a a i'm pretty lit i'm not gonna lie oh 72 dollars for an eighth i'm expecting to get pretty late overall though i'd give it like a solid seven just because the flavors i don't know to me it's not well i'm not gonna buy it again so that's why i'm giving it like a seven um it did get me high though so you're looking for that you know that's a plus um one i do recommend is to survive so i think you guys should try that first or the area 41. i know the area 41 is a mix of um sunset sherbert and geological 41. that shows gas but um that's gonna be it for the video guys let me know what other pre-rolls i should buy being about reviewing connected there's this two grand prix rule for and it's like 22 bucks in my dispensary so i think that's what i'm going to review that's the one i'm going to buy this friday let me know if you guys want to see a dispensary video i'm going to bang out hello videos now man shout out to everybody that subscribed and uh catch you on the next video man peace let me know you want to see a room tour and some shoes we got shoes we got some pretty sick

turpy please [Music] you", "5uqjclblkLg": "okay cool today in the name of what's in my pre-roll we've got this one gram cryptochronic joint from alien labs the people decided it was a slim margin but alien labs pushed it through so yeah let's go ahead and see what's going on here uh so we got alien labs of course crypto chronic indoor pre-roll and let's see one gram so that's all the info we know there let's get to this testing panel here let me put it back here all right crypto chronic coming in at twenty four point five four percent thc a and o nine t there's all sorts of numbers on here total thc at 21.97 percent though that's the one i'm used to seeing and cbd at point zero five percent so uh yeah that's that i don't see the total cannabinoids on there necessarily so uh maybe i am missing that completely so if you guys see it let me know but this is packaged back on nine nine here so we're coming up on halloween so just a little over or under two months right now so yeah about six weeks more or less yeah i'm not here to do math i'm here to see what's in this j but speaking of math this was 20 bucks out the door uh from hyperwolf and i believe i've seen it on catalyst menu at the same ticket now so pretty cool i'm glad that they're coming down a little bit i remember buying a j not too long ago for 30 bucks that was a little pricey so i'm glad to see these at uh you know just 20 bucks out the door feels a little more appropriate um all right so yeah there we go the seal is off let's crack this tube i've never smoked crypto chronic so i'm not exactly sure what to expect flavor wise get this angled down just slightly there we go um but yeah let's do a crutch check real quick oh actually a nice crutch a little just a tiny bit weak but yeah not at all typical i would say it does feel fairly tightly packed and there is a weird vein or ridge right here uh so i don't know what that is somebody else my boy dude doing things had a joint with a similar ridge that's the only time i've ever seen it so i don't know what that is if what's going on something in the packing process or the tech there but uh that's weird to see a vein basically in your joint uh but the material doesn't feel incredibly tightly packed maybe a little bit right here um but yeah the crutch is good so that's awesome let me go ahead and get a dry pool this one almost has like a caramel like uh like a caramel popcorn kind of taste that's how it hit me at first definitely like a grungy sweetness there i really like that so i probably will like how it smokes we'll see but let's check out this material i guess this stuff is just extra [ __ ] that made its way out of the tube i'll leave it on there but let's see what's inside of here so let's take my tiny scissors and make her work our way down next to this vein i don't know why it's there again that's a little weird uh we'll see if that denotes anything once we open it up but i don't know it almost looks like the joint was like vacuum sealed afterward which i know it's not a fully sealed up environment but that i don't know what would cause that little ridge there it's just kind of weird it's like the extra material got all sucked together there um all right so there we go down at the crutch let's pop this stuff out there it is you guys a little bit better of an angle here there we go perfect and i should still be worried about my phone overheating uh but you know it's colder now so i'm not so concerned but i probably shouldn't be dilly dallying when cutting these things open all right let's go ahead and see what's in here what is this purple this is a nice color to it it's just a little hint of purple and a sea of darker green here and let's smash these down i already see a tiny boy a couple tiny boys little uh tiny passengers no big deal as i say typically when i'm going through the material itself um you know i mean unless somebody's doing this exactly with this material they're not gonna they're not gonna find what i'm gonna find you know so it looks like there are just you know i mean it's not awful they're not like big stems at all but there is this stuff which is just kind of looks like just tiny tiny tiny stems so i don't know what kind of material they start with um it's looking okay i mean i'm not finding any big offenders in here just little tiny like memories of sticks i guess you can call them that here i'm gonna try to pull one out here see if we can even if you guys can even see it but this is the worst i would say a fender here it's there's a few of these it's not really significant um but they're there so i'm just noting it but yeah so you have to zoom way in so so it's like it's not lumber free exactly but as you can see kind of if i pan over there's other instances of material or you know material like this like where it's just these look i mean next to my finger it's almost insignificant i mean it's hard to see so so um yeah i mean it's not passenger free but the passengers that are in here are acceptable i would say they pay their dues they're not stowaways uh and yeah i mean it's just what's to be expected in a pre-roll um so i mean i could probably go through this fish all those out but if it was me and i was grinding this up i mean i would throw that in my joint too i'm not going to spend i'm not that meticulous when it comes to rolling my own herb it's like you know you grind it up you throw it aj this material looks decently ground it's a little finer than i'd probably like but it's looking okay let me go ahead and get a sniff on these grinds so i got distracted sound like somebody was outside my window um it's there is a mint that really came forward i would say in this smell first uh but there's kind of like this sweetness it's not exactly cream but it's like a sweetness and maybe a slight vanilla to it uh it smells really good i like it i like the dry pull better though that hit me more like i said at first like a caramel popcorn so that was interesting but yeah it's got a good smell to it so i'm definitely gonna smoke this and you know not too many offended offended offended passengers that's what i'll call them offended uh yeah nothing too offensive in this material nothing that turns me off exactly so yeah let's go ahead and get away and if it comes up to 0.9 or more just giving that leeway on my janky scale uh if it comes up to 0.9 or more we are golden um yeah my only criticism really is just those kind of kind of passengers and you know the fact that it's a little ground down but let's see here let me get you guys over to the weigh station all right can i get a good angle on it yes there we go you guys can see that so let me get a tear here tearing it out all right so we're looking for 0.9 or more let's go alien labs let's do this i have a feeling you're gonna be fine well let's see will it be generous that's the question all right we're at 1.1 so yeah a little generous a little generous not overly generous not jungle boys generous but fairly generous especially because there's stuff left on the paper so i mean yeah this is up to you if you are cool with what you've seen here you're down with the ticket i'd say go for it i smoked uh i can't remember which one oh it was the alien mints because they're taking that off the shelf i smoked alien mince j it smoked excellently so yeah i have no doubt this will smoke well so i'm going to go ahead i'm going to give it an a plus i'm not going to give it an s rank but an a plus an a plus just because i have that extra weight in there too so good job alien labs can't wait to smoke this", "2EqnhWCsooY": "row row row your blunt full a cbd and break it down roll it up we not rolling once today no no no i got them i got them three rolls my cbd heroes heroes yeah oh i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry for those of you who might not know what's going on right here let me welcome you to smoking legal or if you've been here before welcome back good to see you again uh shout out to all my subscribers salute to you and if you got the notification bell wrong you didn't know the game that was a little to you my friend uh by the way i go by the name taz man i review [ __ ] mainly him and today today well well first off something that may not mean a lot to you can mean a lot to someone else like going right there and hitting that subscribe button that would mean a lot look the goal is to get to 20k by the end of the year i want to be at 20k by the end of 2020 or when i'm from 2020 when get it so i think that with you guys help that would mean a lot if you could get me there we're close we'll close we're right at 19 so if we could just push through i want to get 20 by 20 ah but anyway that's off the subject today we have pre-rolls coming from they just sent me this cool sticker so i like to show them off feeling is believing that's their slogan it's green unicorn farms uh i don't know if you know this but i like stickers they give me a green sticker you know what you know what let me just let me get my sticker put my sticker on because i'm a fan if i can get it off of this freaking paper i don't have a painter so it's hard for me to separate it from the other side okay there we go success success so we're gonna put that right there it matches the cap you think i plan to do that i didn't today um i believe last time i asked you guys which pre-roll did you want me to do next because they sent me like five different strains and the winner is drums please it's the hawaiian haze uh i love their packaging i love these little pop top tubes that they come in it keeps them nice and fresh hawaiian haze for those of you who do not know is a sativa also their preros what i do like about them again is that they are one gram pre-roll so you're getting a nice pre-roll which i can really appreciate let me give this little top a little squeeze because all you gotta do is squeeze the top like that you hear that eat it that's that freshness that's that pop of freshness and what you have contained in there is a nice one gram pre-roll there's something about the hawaiian haze every time i smell it it's like [Music] whee i ain't never been to hawaii but i plan to go one day you did it smells good hawaii is a fruity smelling strain it's sweet it's tasty i must admit i'm a little biased right this video is gonna be a little biased because hawaiian haze is one of my favorite strains period hands down i love hawaiian heist so i'm i'm going to be a little biased towards the strain but i'm also going to judge this a little strong like i'm going to be a i'm going to critique it down to the t because it's got a standard to live up to hawaiian haze is great but i've had it not be so great from of some places so i hope that green unicorn farms is gonna be one of the places where it is absolutely great from you so salute to health wealth and self self love is the best love if you haven't heard the words i love you today then please get to the closest mirror to yourself self i love yourself because you can't love anyone else or expect anyone else to love you if you don't love yourself um why not it just it smells so good green unicorn man i'm telling you their pre-rolls are ready to smoke as soon as you take them out man you don't have to what we call downside we call it freaking when you have to kind of work it a little bit to loosen them up you don't have to loosen it up it is just ready to go straight out of the little popped up tube i like that a lot classic this is classic i mean this is classical wine haze it's sweet it's fruity you get those little piney undertones and look how clean that smoke is that smoke is just plain you see how that smoke is just clean man it's a clean oh let's just it's this is it's right on time and i'm i'm i'm starting to love pre-rolls more and more because it's straight to the point no wait no no roll up time no grinding no just it's just straight to the point i go through phases i had a phase where i was smoking nothing but cones uh i bought me a six shooter to roast up six at a time i was about 50 packs i went through a phase and then i went back to ruts only because the only thing i don't like about cones and free roads is that the ashes tend to go a little bit everywhere it could just be me especially when i'm in the car um but i don't know how they do it but green unicorn does it right like my ashes are just falling i have to actually tap my ashes out i don't know how they're doing it but they got the pre-roll game right two thumbs up for green unicorn you guys got the pre-roll game right man excellent customer service shout out to chris man down there at green unicorn shout out to robert down that green unicorn man these guys are great people i love their products yeah as the effects again with cbd flower you're gonna feel the relaxing of the shoulders you're gonna feel your body relax a little bit you're gonna feel the anxiety start to flow away and being that it's a sativa hawaiian hazel's a sativa uh it's a it's more of an energetic strain it's not gonna have you lazy couch locked or anything like that it's going to have you ready to complete whatever it is you were doing you're going to want to go ahead and get that and it could be just me but i found that hawaiian haze and special sauce are the two cbd strains i'm gonna suggest that for me have to be good for eating because they give me the munchies i don't know why i don't know why those these two specifically do that but hawaiian haze gives me the munchies man i'm ready to eat now the fix upbeat energetic the taste it's sweet it's fruity you can taste the pineness you can taste the islands it you can taste it tastes like aruba jamaica come on pretty much it tastes like that i feel like i should be on the beach somebody's beach green unicorn two thumbs up again hawaiian is definitely a ghost string and man they pre-rolled here look how much smoke you get i'm fighting back a cough it's strong it hits you right they make you want to cough definitely a great strain definitely definitely definitely worth checking out green unicorn farms i can't wait to see uh what other what else do you guys have in store i've only had the pre-rolls from them so what i'm gonna do i'm gonna try to get some of their flour too so i can roll it up and and just look at it on hand and smoke it too the pre-rolls are amazing so far so good with the pre-rolls but like i said i'm on a mission to try every strain or at least the majority of strains from every company that i buy from because i just i just want to see what else they have to work out for so right now with this hawaiian haze it's a go and the pool that's what turned me out like i said pre-rolls sometimes they just they're so tight but the pool on this man you just hit it it's it's easy and they're located in california y'all know y'all know what it is with cali cali just seems to turn out good and good flower man good product shout out to california shout out to you guys thank you for tuning in as i like to say here on smoking legal keep it positive or keep it pushing we're going to keep it positive or keep it pushing mucho mucho i'm", "IZmbM787F3s": "t-h-e what is up my tac family it's been a minute since i've talked to you guys um

mission dispensary i picked up two things two things uh i think i'm gonna just do uh one thing for this video and then the video after this i'm gonna do another video explaining the other item but i wanna let you guys know mission dispensary that's on 85th and commercial mission dispensary in chicago was great service great experience i love the setup of the dispensary um the prices were good like everything about this dispensary gave me good vibes and you know i got to let you guys know how i feel about the dispensary so you guys can see for yourself and i wouldn't just you know let you guys know if it wasn't true uh but yeah let's check out what i got today no matter of fact let me show you guys the inside of mission dispensary i got a little footage right here reported online and um yeah i was in there like five minutes you know that's the best thing about it so right now what i'm going to review is a brand that i've never had before so it's my first time reviewing this brand and we got some igm pre-rolls ibm stands for i believe i'm not a mistaken illinois-grown medicine um let me see if it says that anywhere on here yep it does it look illinois-grown medicine and it's a pre-roll joint these are one gram of a strand called sunburn i'm gonna give you guys a closer look you know how i do it um by the fact i'll give it to you right [Music] now [Music] but yeah back on the sunburn um this is a one gram pre-roll uh coming in at 25.01 thc uh you ask how much this cost because usually illinois at dispensaries pre-rolls like for just one single one gram pre-roll you're looking for anywhere to 18 to 30 bucks probably this maybe 16 bucks too but this ten dollars ten dollars for a gram so it had me kind of skeptical like why is it only ten dollars you know and i've seen the strand i mean it looks you know sunburned 25 percent thc i mean full grand prix roll you know it looks nice um you guys seen the inside it smells amazing sunburn wow pre-roll it looks nice it looks like i wrote this myself because this is how i close the uh close the front of my my joints you know i don't do the normal twist method like most people and um it's a little space right here but you know we can just burn that off or cut that off snow no biggie i'm pretty sure that's the full ground though because the king size raw and um oh man it smells great actually smells great nah like it has that funky that funky aroma to it for sure um i get some some good some good stuff whoa why is that joint doing that i don't think it's supposed to bend like that i hope i didn't just do that okay let's see how this um let's see how this smokes let's see how it burns you know let's see if we get that white ash you know i love that white ash um now there's all that's left to do is to spark it up you guys know the rules we don't just burn and flame it up we you know burn it you know gotta let it burn a little bit you know so we get that that red circle so we can know it's like burned evenly you know smoking sunburn on g you know i think it's og but cheers to you guys you know just cheers to you guys for anybody that's watching this you know i appreciate you big time heavy especially if you support me on a regular like man you don't know how much it means to me uh like it means a lot seriously so this one's for you guys for sure thanks wow before i even start reviewing first things first you guys see it you guys see it that's the white ash beautiful that's what like that turns me on man like [ __ ] the money [ __ ] the sex like when you know when someone passes me a joint with white ash or i flame up with joy white ass that's that that right there that's what gives me you know [ __ ] gets me gets me going and i'm just [ __ ] with you guys i'm [ __ ] with you guys but look seriously though uh our first rips um it's a very weird taste i'm not gonna lie to you um i never had sunburn before this i say the taste is weird because i never tasted this before um it's actually not a bad taste though it's a weird taste it's just like because i never i wouldn't expect this taste i'm trying to find out how to describe it bear with me let me take another poll honestly guys this is a tough tough review because it's not bad it's not a bad you know um strand i know it's been a while since i've smoked but i know weed doesn't taste like this i'm gonna try to describe it as best as i can it tastes uh like a fruity you know um fruity weed basically that's what it kind of tastes like it has a sweet taste for sure um it tastes very good you guys see the stacking white ash man i'll see how long it goes too i'm not even gonna ask it i'm just gonna see how long the white ash is gonna go for but um yeah quite feeling the effects though the effects aren't as heavy as you know normally when i give you guys a review first few pools i feel the effects um i don't know if i mentioned hold on what is what is this i don't know i don't know if this is a hybrid or or indica or what you know i don't know or sativa oh i asked it on accident [ __ ] okay i guess the effects are coming in um that very sweet weed um it tastes very good it's just a weird you wouldn't like i don't know like someone passed me this i'm like damn what kind of weed is this you know never like you know because the taste is just like you wouldn't expect it you know would i buy this again yeah for sure would i recommend this yeah for sure so what would i have to rate this pre-roll with the beautiful white ash the beautiful taste um the mellowing effects not too strong i'm still able to function um i would give this this sunburn i'll give it a nine you know um i was gonna give it a uh eight but i i find no reason to give it a eight you know i'll give it a nine out of ten for sure oh i recommend you guys trying this for yourself maybe somebody will be able to explain it better than me sorry about that um but yeah it's it's fire that's what i like one word to describe it's fire for sure wow it's like just like that a sweet aftertaste that's all i can explain like imagine if you just ate a piece of pound cake that's what this weed tastes like damn i just described it for you guys

like they put little buds at least additional ingredients terpenes so that's why it tastes so [ __ ] good because they put turkey in this [ __ ] so i just want to let you guys know that i want to i want to make a video i want to make the i video to make the video to where i don't have to edit it so i can't [ __ ] up but today i'm going to be reviewing the infused xl piro by jeter so let's get to it all right so just start off i got this from uh pcf it was like 30 bucks i think i'm not sure how much it was i'll show you guys a receipt but it came out came out [ __ ] blank see that's patient care first everything but it was like 30 bucks it was like 22 bucks plus tax let's get to the pre-roman this is going to be some tropicana cookies it's going to be a sativa um the cross of this is there's a cross between girl scout cookies and tangy so this is going to be cool so i'm going to show you guys the package real quick [Music] oh and the thc percentage is um 26 tsu and 3.2 milligrams of cbd packaged june 15 2020 expiration date june 15th 2021. there's gonna be two grams of indoor flour and infused yeah be careful when you open it because just keeping this [ __ ] so you're going to push down and then you're going to have plastic you have to take out the plastic we just opened it already boom it's going to come with a glass tip with the brand right there it's gonna be a two grand pre-rule i don't know if it's two grams of flour or maybe like a 1.5 or like a 1.8 with like a 0.2 of oil and then some keef but it could be two grams of flour oh yeah it has to be two grams of flour because it says two grams of vendor flour and fused with oil all right so let's uh it says it's going to burn for 25 minutes straight that's crazy where does it say that so hopefully this last 25 minutes it says on the package up i sparked this [ __ ] man and if you guys watch my videos you guys know what this noise means but if you don't go back and find out but let's park this [ __ ] okay so i never really buy uh heroes like this with like hella grounds in them tastes more fruity it's a mix of what girl scout cookies and little roast cookies is the airflow is crazy close out huh that's crazy you think you're done blowing off the smoke and just keeps going it tastes good huh like fruity yeah it does taste hella fruity usually i don't like to taste the pearls they should which is good it doesn't taste like they put trimming in there seems like they put little buds at least you know look at the eye it's not canoeing too bad either i mean a little bit you can see how about saying that brain pretty good just a little bit definitely worth 30. i mean like uh we kept my 30 dollar eighth and hold up a whole ways that's true i don't know how i feel about these where they come he has a glass it is cool it's cool it's like it was like something like it was like my birthday or something yeah it's like something occasionally like when we went to the lake that's a perfect gift yeah that's perfect yeah 30 bucks tell me how much you guys get this for i'm curious because you guys probably paid like 50 bucks for this [ __ ] maybe 60. i imagine 60 50 bucks dude the airplane is is amazing yeah bro you throw a hell of smoke you think you're done then you just keep going fat ass it's like you're vaping bro like the clouds are white they're not standing at them this is a good people i don't really [ __ ] with like an eight like eight and a half you know like the flow of it so the air flush is crazy yeah but she's hitting nice i wouldn't rate the airflow but i would say it's good like it's perfect well yeah i guess you can rate the airflow don't rate this [ __ ] like 10 out of 10. it's cool to be giving a raise yeah like this 16 solids and we're like halfway done through it already and it's not canoeing like we can tell one side's burning more but it's nothing it's in the burnout isn't it even now it's been even out the more we smoke it this is the only other pillow i'm aware of that's um in competition with the packwoods and the even around me the pacquiao's are like uh 60 bucks for the same [ __ ] two grand [Music] i usually don't get like this what are you calling me for no mom it's an infused pre-roll the paper is infused all right supposedly you take it to the dome and last oh yeah it's cash they're sauces they would the carts are pretty good took though have you tried the potter's cards nope there's a little base because there's something that i have there used to be what is it called what is this martian anybody know that that actually i'll be recording for 20 minutes [Music] a 500 really good edible and then nothing today swear man i believe you you girls no but i can smoke a little joint and get high you know yeah i can smoke a little joy and i'll get lit the edibles something about it it just doesn't kick in check that out that shit's just straight just rods you guys see that man you guys [ __ ] hear that i didn't know that i started [ __ ] with cbd more starting to [ __ ] with it bro yeah what does it do it makes you a bit like when it when you when you really do that it makes you just like your whole body kind of makes you just like more chill but you don't feel high yeah not like a high but like like you're i don't know like straight cbd no i haven't just straight cbd though but i i've had the i had a card that was 18 cbd and that [ __ ] was felt good 18 is pretty high yeah cars usually have like like two three four um some we doesn't have to use absolutely somebody doesn't have this one has one percent 1.5 percent wax has like two percent yeah that sounds like two percent yeah that's crazy how much was the price but they you can buy cbd huh that's gonna be for the video man i'm pretty lit only that [ __ ] uh 10 out of 10 in my opinion taking actually to the dome i would have been even wondering so uh look i didn't i didn't see this but it said additional ingredients additional ingredients terpenes so that's why it tastes so [ __ ] good because they put turkeys in this [ __ ] so i just want to let you guys know super kawaii", "mU2t7IlRRp0": "hi everyone so today I'm gonna be smoking the 1 gram indica pre-rolled from cannabis no I figured I'd smoke it outside because it's too warm and it would probably smell in the house so let's pop it open there it is smells a little bit sweet like citrusy okay so let's let's try this out I'm tasting that dirt it's not good thing I smoked look at the it's smoky I could just imagine if it was done the house whole thing would be probably couldn't even see me it's a smooth smoke that's not like when you inhale it it makes you start coughing right away it's nothing like that I'm still tasting that that's citrusy if you hear and he's finishing uh I'm giving a video oh yes and what is it a blue a blue raspberry crush we picked up from the Circle K so we'll try that it would go second holy [ __ ] is it ever smoking a little bit paranoid yeah so that the smell is I'm probably thinking it smells like weed really bad um smoke there's plenty of it the taste is citrusy and dirt but I'm sure it smells like Mead get ding I'm kind of in here so nobody can see I don't know Matt it's tastes like raspberries not really sure what blue raspberry tastes like but it tastes like raspberries I'm getting a little bit in a little bit worried out here really come outside and do this so a rating I'll give this it's right now it's decent that could change the feeling I'm feeling really paranoid right now I don't really I don't really like this it's just paranoid anything else but paranoid yeah look at the [ __ ] smoke coming off that that would make you more paranoid if you did it in the house okay and I can't say it dries you out I would I would flip and [ __ ] right now if the neighbor came home I would be in in the house so fast [ __ ] I think all the smokes won't be staying in here I came and smoke it any faster because it's making me cough no because I'm so dry if it wasn't hot I would take this inside but uh but it's hot and [ __ ] smoke would be stuck to the walls that's monkey I have the dog I would hear Charlie's out here he's right over there if he hears something I'll know here comes ed with a stupid cop it's smoky come on side it's me take this one out no I'm not really enjoying this I look over and there's like clouds of [ __ ] smoke I just finished my video it's the video that goes before this video it's kind of a boring video but it's still a [ __ ] video so don't watch it or don't watch it or just [ __ ] off hey maybe do that I don't know but just go and watch it or don't I don't know [ __ ] it hey anyway yeah go ahead talk about your joint I'm here I'm listening I said it I was telling them good thing the neighbor didn't isn't home a neighbor over there would not complain she would just come over and buggy for some and then um I realized there was like clouds of smoke here and then I started to get worried but it's so hot that I can't do it in the house and I can't smoke it any faster because it's making me cough and I'm not really liking this cuz I'm came really paranoid and I don't know what to do so just can you have just some so if the cops come they'll smell it on you too I just did bong hopes and I always smell that only does always smell like weed [ __ ] so you know what I would say about this joint did you see your [ __ ] head I think I heard a whipping sound this is not a joint to smoke outside yes it is no it's not it's a perfect joint roadside wait til it's like windy and you're not you can go into your own house and smoke it I have a funny feeling that somebody's gonna call the police about this is legal Vicky call all they want the cops aren't coming they may they won't they're not gonna though they'll see the address and they'll be like no [ __ ] we're going yes nope we could charge them on as Miss nope thing wrong and now I'm feeling a little bit dizzy yeah it's a it's good stuff I would recommend this you're gonna break your necks if you keep turning it like that calm down nobody cares good I can they see me there's over to see you the guy that was just there [Laughter] like I feel I should get off the chair and just kneel on the [ __ ] ground if I know how to do the sound effect thing I would add sound effects forever you know like one of those cartoon sounds good [ __ ] decision it's a really good decision this is one of those always always always smoke your weeds in the heat well you can't always but when you can make sure you do it's you better it's you harder people are getting mad I can hear the door slamming I don't hear anything slamming I heard somebody get into a car a few doors down cuz they're probably going somewhere nobody is some more of that nobody cares about your joint I [ __ ] think so [ __ ] I should have put up the [ __ ] walls don't do what Donna does exactly do not except for there's nothing wrong with this I think I would have put up the walls yeah you better put up the walls then it'd be all hot-boxed and then you'd be complaining because there'd be smoke SEPA don't like one of these cracks or something like a [ __ ] fireplace and then you'd be really paranoid I know how you are opening for you there you know what I feel kind of like I needed to get dark fast so I can walk into the house I said it tastes like I had that one before I think I said taste like raspberries I don't know what blue raspberry taste like I think I had that one in one of my videos before I just don't remember but I think I did and I don't think it was very good if you had like a long day at work I would recommend buying one of these I wish there is like a big wind right now I just hold it out so they blow like it would go down with burn away that's what I want right now no you don't smoke it foolish hey don't be foolish only a fool would let it burn away okay so the smell I said what did I say I'd forget what I said I say it's real strong it's like setting off the bat signal I [ __ ] forget the bat signal everybody knows I don't know what I said I said I said the smoke I said there's like lots of it cuz that's how I feel that there's lots of smoke the taste is dirt and citrusy the smell I said you would know what I think you would know it's weed I think that's what I said ya know paranoid that's how I feel on this I think if ya do I could probably [ __ ] run real fast if I had to I think so I would probably be sore the next morning cuz I pulled all the muscles but I'm sure I can [ __ ] get away if I had to okay remember like half like a little ways back I said oh it was a decent no it's like a know why but it was it oh my [ __ ] that's what it is I really just need to hurry up and smoke there so kiss you might need to speak up can they even hear you what I have to go like right in like this and talk hmm yell at it no I'm not yelling Shh yo Eddie can be doing the army crawl to the house seriously if you wanted to smoke this make sure like you're on like the 12th floor balcony or something like that so nobody else could smell it as it goes down it's still [ __ ] there so you're getting your money's worth I say yes yes I am yes people would be getting their money's worth it's smoky though in here do you see the smoke yeah it's cool it's good we're good I know Donna smoking weed [Laughter] [Music] just like these wait these white panels and I was thinking I should have like hooked one up to the clothesline there so I can get to the door quicker without people seeing me I talk about the joint I did did you give them your review I did twice it's good stuff yeah you can hi I don't I'm damn dogs [Music] where's Charlie wait we're [ __ ] wanting to play I gotta find okay that house holy [ __ ] as you get the way into those you walk right there to the door that's easier said than done no don't be a wussy yeah you have like the rest of it cuz I can't smoke anymore because it just this is just making me a little bit too paranoid like I didn't forget about them they're watching me be paranoid they see they see the effects that the indica one gram one gram what was I thinking I don't even do like gram bongs this is like doing a grand ball yeah you know you do your bonds there's not a gram I mean how much do you think that is I don't know but not a grin that's a lot well that's what I ball like I smoked most of it so I don't even know what to do with myself I feel a just sitting here and letting the mosquitoes eat me till it gets dark there's not even a wind or anything so this is just were snow it's not awesome at all it's pretty scary I think I'm just gonna like sit here for a while and maybe calm down because really I'm not really I'm going to be a don't know when but what's today Monday so sometime this week I'll be doing a review on the the edible cubes and then I have another Adam edible that's a hundred milligrams like it's I think it's a hard candy so maybe we will do that and maybe I'll do it in here because it doesn't smell but there's I hear people talking and stuff now so I think that's all I have to say about about this is is [Music] don't you review okay so that's my that's my review it's good get it I can't abismo the one gram indica you're paranoid as [ __ ] and I need to get into the house and the crush the blue raspberry crush it's good she gets up it's like a little sweet but not too bad and that's everything so that's it that's all bye", "kNtTsvaqGdk": "welcome back fellow youtubers fellow subscribers fellow medicator x' fellow out of quarantine in pennsylvania inners fellow subscribers fellow viewers fellow fellows alright so we're out of quarantine in PA we're in the green that's always cool but it's like nothing's changed though social distance warm most everything still closes five hours early I mean there really is no doors between [ __ ] yellow and green in this state I mean Commonwealth I mean what's the point in doing all this progress if you're never gonna go anywhere welcome to PA well here we are people let's start with a disclaimer disclaimer you're not 21 rotor get out don't stay here don't watch change the video go on to something else there's a [ __ ] glitch again YouTube take care of your [ __ ] I bet now at this point there's still words coming out of my mouth with my mouth ain't moving huh anyway there's the door see it right there if you're not 21 or older be gone if you are 21 or older stick around I got some [ __ ] to show you um tonight's video is gonna be on a product from tweedle farms um I'm not really usually big one like the whole pre-roll thing but tweedle farms has got some really awesome pre-rolls lately um I seen AMD's daily dose shout out to them dossie ash the a and the D of a and DS daily dose did a uh they did they did a review of a pre-roll from Toyo Farms that looked pretty tasty I think they did a good job um if you haven't checked out that video yet go on over there and check it out I'll wait here till you do well now that you're back from checking that out I got I'll review of a pre-roll for you this is tweedle farms pine Barry White CBD pre-roll now just the thing it says large pre-roll 100% pure hemp I think it's got a little QR code there I guess that's what that is and click here and get it to focus oh gosh Oh guys there we go go ahead and pause and check that out if you want at your leisure um tweedle farms is the only company i know that has these like really cool like little containers that like lock like like that's not coming out there it's locked so basically you uh unlock it with the little Yoshi little dings here I don't know what to I guess still nipples in the right spot so here it is folks fellow fellows here is the product er you pay here is his chance nothing came out it's all in the pre-roll that's pretty sweet that's pretty sweet we're going to uh sniff this a little it's pretty tight it's not real loose it's twisted all the way to the end I think they cut the end off there which is pretty sweet um I'm gonna lead it up there's that glitch again I hate not quite sure why it does that kind of annoying so we're gonna light this up after I knock a bunch of [ __ ] over right here we go right right off the bat let's go with a few issues here they're not bad just you know the daily [ __ ] not quite sure what the brand of coolness is doesn't say wrong on it it's kind of weight all the way through paper and all this is a nice draw that seems to be burning uniformly for my work there's a little bigger that's not a bad call bad cop' will be like oh god you know sometimes when you inhale something other than oxygen you cough you can see that the paper isn't see-through I mean it's it's pretty thick but it's not harsh nice solid cloud smoke the exhale leaves a kind of a sweet flavor nothing the paper or the comb but I think from the hemp itself it's a pine berry and white CBG I said CBD earlier I'm sorry cmeg CBG which did get a Scooby Snack like a little bit out of the back there that's alright CVG is slowly becoming one of my favorite compounds from the hemp plant it's very relaxing and mellow which who the hell doesn't want that who doesn't learn relax who doesn't wanna be mellow well I want to be so let's go over some things here the packaging it's uh it's pretty cool it's blue it's white it's got a colorful little tweedle Farms thing on there I think that's pretty sweet tweedle farms is usually in green or black which is I mean red sorry so the yellow is pretty cool touch get back here and enjoy it a minute forgive me if I don't say anything for a moment don't scream take it in an absorbent for ammo can I have a drink yeah that's part of relaxing I thought long day at work there's that put you know glitcher where were like every three minutes I think I'm gonna sending you to an email about it if anybody knows the email address to youtube lay it on me I'll complain for all of us have to forgive me him PA the pollens really high it's been like hot cold hot cold hot cold rainy hot cold rainy rainy rainy rainy hot cold it's hard to kind of keep kind of keep the asthma under control and with asthma I really probably shouldn't be smoking anything but my asthma is acute not chronic so so we're 11 minutes in well maybe nine actually I gave like two minutes of an intro but still burning pretty uniformly I have to say that a total forms always has the best some of the best products I mean I mean Twitter firms is Instagram page is really cool too like they have a lot of pictures you know a lot of info and then you go to their website it's very informative to the point there's a lot of specs on their strings descriptions which I was gonna check out the description of this but I didn't get to it I'm sorry excuse me normally I try to give you like a dossier of like what's going on with their problem of any product actually carbonated beverages they really get tea after a while you know a lot of bloating I've been reviewing tweedle Farms products for over a year now I'm trying to branch out into some new companies new like like like accessory companies like say Meister they're pretty cool and per glass and raw and I'm thinking about starting to do a line of videos on my channel of just like reviewing hemp raps I'm an excessive astana thing I mean ash can tell you from Andy I have probably got the biggest box full of her brows like 70 or 80 or 90 different temper apps just in a box like when I see him I buy them put them aside and only say I'm gonna review his temper up now I do post pictures on my media my my facebook group I have a closed group if you'd like to be a member of that group just put it down in the put it down in the description or yeah the the comments down there that you'd like to be a member of my closed Facebook group the nights around the table and I'll be more than happy to send you a invitation to that I post a lot of pictures a smoke doctor and a and D and a bunch of other really cool reviewers like relief buddies and Boop and all them guys they're all members and they they post on there regularly what's coming up soon stuff like that you know I'm pretty I'm pretty involved in a lot I mean I actually have a couple different Facebook groups actually but this is the one I have for him the products but I'm trying to get some companies to work with me to do some reviews for them it's not easy sometimes I mean III got in contact with if you guys remember from back in the past I did some work with rosin tech and some work with t-rex oh no I never did t-rex although I have their products I haven't gotten a chance to review them yet but juicebox they're working with me now to educate you guys on a lot of their awesome products feel free to go back in the line of videos and check those out juice box is a really awesome company they got some pretty cool [ __ ] going on I'm trying to deal with nug Smasher and tank glass and I talked to Josh from time to time from Raw which I support their products immensely sometime I'm gonna do a video just like what's in this bag there's a raw [ __ ] in here I really enjoyed their products yeah but that's not what this video is about but uh I got a talk you know about some stuff while I'm doing the review you know it's all part of the review talking and informing the taste of this thing I can taste a pine Barry in here um I have some white from another company I'm not gonna say their name on this video and I have a smoke some of it in fact I opened it up and smoked because I was really intrigued by like the whole description and everything so have it in a jar and I'm gonna do a review of it later it's uh I knew in the company that I got it from its 23% CVG which is awesome 23% mind blown I'm going to start soon working on some collaborations with other companies to create some DM Blair product lines again last year I worked with Western farms and we made a bunch of awesome products that you guys some of you reviewed some of you liked and purchased I appreciate all your support over that I got some new products I'm working on soon be pairing up with a couple people to make a new line to get it out into the public once it's hoppin and ready I'll let you guys know and you can review the products if you like if you're a reviewer or if you're just interested in general oh yeah I did receive a samples promise to make a review I mean I'll take you in your word if you know you want the the white in here the reason why I brought up on other company is because I remember what that tasted like and I don't really taste that in here I mean it could be over toned by the paper I'm not too sure but I definitely know the pine better strain and I can I can taste that in there haven't hit a seat yet which is awesome most pre-rolls have like little white kernel e-naught seeds but Shelly bits in there not experiencing any of that with this pre-roll it's not bitter in any way it's actually very pleasing getting messages when I'm making new views he's like 1:30 2 o'clock in the morning you know who would be messaging me well then again I am DM Blair and I put my number out there for everybody in fact my numbers in the description any questions concerns comments just want to talk tell me about you experience this with products or what you got going home and what's happened to look happy to listen I mean look like Johnny P Andre banks aka smoke doctor we uh we all talk from time to time relief buddies I mean rolling this together or if you're just the person who watches the videos we want to say hi you want to shout out hey I'll shout your channel out if you want I mean just put it into the comments down below I mean things I'm going through in like the whole like law and things I'm not even concerned about that I don't even sweat it I mean cops have always been a big part of my life like floating around I've been in metal bands and I've been in the bar scenes and been in so many different genres of life in my 46 years that cops have always been and I never really gave a [ __ ] about them anyway I mean they gotta do what they got to do and that's her ass and collect not serve and protect so look at all the writing going on I mean I don't want to be political and I don't want a lot of comments about the writing but I'm just saying cops really are willing [ __ ] go to their head you own the badge maybe come above it all if you're a cop and watching and you're not like that well I'm sorry that your honor it into all that but you know what I'm a hemp smoker and I'm Shawn Road into the marijuana drug dealer thing so I guess it just goes with the [ __ ] territory you know I don't have a bad attitude about it I just don't like being called something I'm not you know that'd be like me calling a a punk rock or a skinhead they're obviously not and I don't have a problem with either of those types of people I love everyone in fact I tell people every day that I love them I love everyone it's just it sometimes you get labeled in things just because people don't take the time to educate themselves you know like I get a lot of questions about does him get you high well there's a reason why it's been taken off the scheduled one note and put into its own little area and called hemp now instead of marijuana because it never was marijuana it's something else it doesn't have THC in it enough to be psychoactive that's the word I'm looking for it's always THC is its own thing that's not to say there aren't compounds in here that make you feel [ __ ] good though I mean there are TCA and there's CBG and there's other compounds that do but they are not illegal although some people seem to think they are it's time that we educate ourselves law enforcement as well don't just go to work in cash a paycheck you know educate yourself ignorance is not bliss I've had cops tell me you don't need to understand the [ __ ] law you just need to follow it that's like [ __ ] we escaped the rule of a king over why would we why would we ever want to be that I mean we're in an age where we have Google right at our hands at all times to be able to educate ourselves in anything even if it's just polka music and believe me not like polka music I like disco I like all that eclectic when it comes to music just cuz I was a heavy metal drummer and a heavy metal band doesn't mean I don't like all genres of music in fact to be a musician you have to like all genres of music in classical so why not it's all per being in art so let's just take some time to educate ourselves whether you're just trying to enjoy medicating or if you're trying to uphold law or if you're trying to just have a conversation with any of those people I mean I try never to just spat out anything that I don't know something about mm-hmm in fact any one of my friends can tell you that diem Blair / Blair which is my name Blair talks with a lot of fact I mean if I tell you something that's probably because I researched it not because I gotta be right don't take it like that at all I've been wrong I've gotten bad info but I at least try to be informed what's wrong with that nothing nothing wrong being informed and I would think if you were in art or music or law enforcement or a judge or a lawyer or a soldier in the military or anything you would want to be informed and that's what this channels about informing you I'm sorry I think I maybe got off the review issue but there's a lot going on and people ask me a lot of questions especially in my spare time that's why I brought it up I'm sorry get a lot of email not emails texts I'm just view errs and my phone is probably all know like probably 60 viewers alone of people who text me from my number and they asked me questions and they talked to me and asked me how I'm doing and companies companies out review for and we'll talk to something representative on the phone with all these companies I talked to the actual owners on a regular basis they're awesome everyone the companies and the people with idea within the owners are the greatest community and great people on the planet shout out to all of you I couldn't ask for a better people to be in a community with and because of that it's time that we get past ignorant and move on to education now I'm about to the end of this thing and it's not staying late but I think that's me because I'm rambling on and talking I guess maybe if I was puffing this thing more probably so let's do the daily thing Packaging went over like the look of the babe label label is cool the container though is mega cool if I had to give this a reading from one to five one being the least five being the best okay it's this a four and three-quarters I'm sure there's probably something coming out soon it'll probably top this so let's just leave it at four and three-quarters and it's hard plastic though I could probably take an eye out with it but not just but the whole like locking system like how it like locks so it can't come off there is just he sweet I can't I can't get over how sweet that is yeah Lee was when they're pretty tight mmm good so it's not like some labels were like when you you get it you could peel it off or a corner sticking up so they do a great job of making sure that the representation of their product is pretty cool do I feel it where do I feel well believe it or not no no I'm sorry or do I feel it I feel it here and here basically like the size of my head and shoulders so do I recommend the product mm-hmm well if I can feel it working I'm definitely gonna recommend it mmm good night it's working something I smoked did I go and wonder if I'm feeling it I wouldn't recommend but I know I didn't feel this way before I started ingesting it so I would say it's working um on a scale of 1 to 10 of like the products performance I like the effects so I'm going to give them like an 8 I don't normally do that but that's because I don't have a Danko meter so I'm gonna have to go in a different direction with this video so like the performances it's at least an 8 because I can feel it I mean it's not like bow in your face Wow so I can't go 10 but I'm gonna say a good 8 8.0 and I'll make sure I add that into the description at the performances an 8 other net I mean it's pre-roll it's an individual serving I would think so you can find them on our website and tweedle farms dot-com I guess I'll look it up and put it in description I think it is calm I usually purchase a couple at a time or should say I get a couple at a time I think that you know when it comes to Twitter forms and the performance of the products I've never had any product of theirs that didn't work or do what they're advertising it will do and there are descriptions of the products are usually spot-on I wouldn't stay reviewing for them if I thought for one minute there was no credibility to the product so shout out to Twitter farms for credibility and for your awesome honest this you really know your products give you that so until next time guys let me leave you with this message educate yourselves no matter who you are if you're watching whether you're a bus driver or a college student or radio personality which I've been or a comic book collector doesn't matter what you are your heart and your mind or what you have you need to educate yourselves and be the best that you can be always so I'm gonna end with be safe

this one is actually clocking in at 18.3% with point for CVD so the description on this overly packaged item says up david doesn't it [Music] exactly why use my vein okay if anyone figured out how to open this up a little easier than I did it took a minute it took a minute there we go so they come like this and then you get two of them that gets a half grams each mm I would break it up and weigh it but it was just too much of an effort to get that open so we're not gonna do that I should have shot this video you may ask yourself minnici Michelle why are you not suppose avi today you seemed so happy last week [Music] hey oh it's so hard you like the taste we have to smoke into the dryer but it's good it's burning slow listen I'm not gonna lie the last time I actually did get free roads from cetera when they first came out and I did not review them because they burn up so [ __ ] fast like I was like I'm not reviewing like I'm not I'm just I'm not gonna review it and bash it let's let them

good thing right well it's I'm very anxious like I wanna choke a [ __ ] it has not been easy but it has been time the medication that I was on was called suboxone by the way which is like an opiate inhibitor it is because I was on opiates for so long I wanted to ease the withdrawal and I wanted to come off on changed everything gonna do that blah blah blah I was on them for way too [ __ ] long way too long so I was like [ __ ] this [ __ ] I'm taking myself off it I weaned myself down like the past year the work of my doctor I leaned myself down significantly okay so I don't know if you guys like I don't know how many people are coming off medications out there but a lot of medications they have withdrawals and that's just like a couple days there's a thing called pause PA WS post-acute withdrawal syndrome which lasts for what it can last for like you a [ __ ] year oh that's not good however I am NOT I'm not taking a [ __ ] suboxone I'm not gonna do it I have a [ __ ] bottle of them flat pool not I was on her way to [Music] so as far as that I don't know if you guys are coming off any medications when they ask you what they are none of you guys went through some withdrawals how

doing its job I will say that seriously the first time I tried there pre-rolls like I said I didn't even make a video I didn't have time it burned up it was up you know where those things on sparklers that you light up and I mean that was what happened to my joint so I didn't want it like I was so shocked during the video the video was just like me going like oh my god enough I wasn't gonna do it I'm not saying that I won't say that a product is bad the video was bad so I was like oh god I'm really I'm really good I'm laying into them but it was our first beer like I'm not gonna knock the dispensaries like here it is I'm just happy I can get my medicine like I get into all these groups and people are like when I was on PT pills I never [ __ ] made a group page and talked about help I wasn't upset about my oxycodones not being blue or the long color blue I don't want agreement like no one did that my fanox was yellow this month they were not greening up a bit that would assist me

channel so yeah we're done by a ba-ba-ba-ba", "ZE78XtwbN1A": "[Music] guys welcome we're here in corona california at the next master smash lab we're uh going to roll you a two ounce can of gar something i like to enjoy on a saturday afternoon with 20 of my 20 20 25 of my closest friends um and what we have here to start the tools that we have are all sitting on the table we're using another smasher touch for our our rosin extraction we're going to extract 14 grams here of rosin we're going to coat the uh can of gar and a blank de brasil and put a snake on it and we're going to wrap in our thca isolate here and then we're going to drop in rosin droplets throughout the layers of our canagar we're going to start we're going to pack it with four different strains to give it a variety of layers we're going to layer in some diamonds along the way wrap the entire canigar with a hemp wrap at the end and we're gonna put a wood tip on it okay so we can enjoy it it takes about two ounces of flour to make this canagar i guess it'll last for about three uh three and a half hours get 25 to 40 people about as high as you ever want to get and a great conversation piece so stay tuned and follow along all right guys so to make this canogar what we have here is we have a parchment paper uh nug smasher dab tool we're gonna extract uh seven grams at a time in a 37 micron gram bag and that's what we're gonna do first to get this started then we're gonna grind uh each of these up uh with our grinder here and start to pack our kindergarten [Applause] all right very good that's that good make sure that was set right while i packed the bags i'm going to pack the bags bottle text style inverting the bottom corners you can see here as they're overlapping here and i'll get a little smaller yield with the uh using a 37 micron not much but i'll get a super clean product and that's what i'm hopefully after so hopefully the flour is pretty nice pretty fresh [Music] so basically when i pack a bag bottle tech style i want to just pack it even i don't want to be real forceful with the flower i'm not trying to smash the trikes into the into the plant material at all i'm just trying to fill all the voids so that i get a real even extraction and that it maintains that even surface area that i've initially intended for which is a bag that collapses directly down on itself with an accordion-like effect i want to make sure it folds up like that so it's a nice little present you can see how how the bag looks that's one bag again what we're using is 7 gram 37 micron bags for the extraction here that's what i'm packing up [Music] i like to use something like that just so i hook the corners in nice that gives you again your even surface area that is predetermined [Music] [Applause] all right so now we got both our bags packed just gave it a trim there and we slide that in like so once you get one in you can stick the magnet on it holds it up nice you get the other one in you can tuck it down like a little present here and most people don't realize this but you know common sense thing you want to make the last fold the one that's on top that wants to slide in like this [Music] again it's all about holding that surface area and now at this time we're gonna check we're gonna go 700 material psi we got two seven gram bags and 205 degrees [Music] looks like a real nice color real buttery like i'm after oh god it's gorgeous looking though [Music] okay beautiful material [Music] nice smashing touch all right so we got our rosin let's see what it weighs 2.7 grams okay we're starting with the first strain here we're gonna go ahead and grind up the first eighth here [Applause] so this is the base for this canagar it's um it fits in seven grams fits real good in this and that usually if you layer it right and do it right it usually makes for um like i said somewhere two and a half plus to three and a quarter hours of uh good smoke and they'll stay stay going the whole time get everybody high as hell all right so basically what i got is i make a piece of parchment take a piece of parchment and i like to use kirkland parchment from costco and i cut it to about that shape you can see about the size of it and then i i curl it roll it like this and i roll it around the tube that i have this little stainless tube also a straw from a drink straw or a you know one of the yeti cup straws work great but anyway i roll it around that and um stick it in the nug packer and then i make sure that the when it's rolled at the bottom of the parchment's all the way at the bottom the material will stick to the inside of the nut packer so you need this parchment to remain intact all along the way so you got to be careful of that and if it takes you one or two times so it does it takes me one or two times often you know too so just is what it is it's the nature of the beast so i stick the uh the uh hole in there make sure it goes all the way to the bottom and i start packing flour in there i'll go on one side and i'll go back to the next and i like this little card that the nug packer comes with the instruction card for the nug packer to scoop my flower it's real good so it gets it all back you know gathers it back up now you have to be careful in the beginning you can see how that the rod slight slid right through once i start packing it in it won't do that then i like to take a straw once i got a little in there i'll start working it down real gently like i said you want to watch your uh your uh parchment and make sure that your rod's right in the center as you're packing it down and also if you have if your flower's a bit dry you want to make sure that you have a steel water and this will help the flower stick and it'll help it compact all the way through and take your time with it you know work it all the way around and this straw has a little serrated side on one side and then it has a straight flat side on the other but you want to pack the hell out of it you want to be a tight good pack and like i said sometimes it takes two or three times you can take your time with it right so let me see what i got working so far okay so what started to happen here and this is great that's what i want to show you guys what started to happen and often will and people give up on it is the bottom of the parchment started to pack in see it there and it started to compact at the top but the bottom it was all loose so what happened was i put too much flour in in the beginning and i didn't pack it enough in the beginning so we're going to redo this one this is a do-over [Music] all right so it takes a few times to get it right sometimes but what you do it's usually pretty good [Music] [Music] i suggest doing this if you're going to do it with the very best quality flower you can find or grow [Music] okay so we got three more flavors to put in all right flavor too [Music] it's a little morsel here i'm gonna give it a little juice on it [Music] it's thick enough here that we can get that down there won't stick to the stem and cause that some turbulence when we're pulling that out [Music] also i like doing that i wasn't in there too around a little isolate there but it also glues everything together nice once you get your base formed you can be a little you know a little more or less fragile with it as you can tell and things start to go a little faster still don't get too cocky just take your time with it a little at a time pack it in thin layers are good [Music] okay now we're almost at the halfway point you know this is the talked about point at this point once you're down this far everybody that's involved has already got a pretty [ __ ] good buzz going so i'd like to put a little zingers in here and there and throw a little diamond here and in there and just drop it right in keep packing away [Music] like i said you'll fit right at seven grams compact a little more eight nine you can get [Music] we're gonna go to start we're starting to go to some of our fruity flavors because that's how i like to engineer my candy go [Music] okay so at this point i'm gonna add a little more of the rosin droplet in there with a bath and thca [Music] fish it down layered up it's like baking a layered cake you know [Music] exciting isn't it [Music] okay now we're headed to strain number [Music] four labor four baby [Music] it's right between that one i like to drop a couple diamonds [Music] all right that's our last flavor going in the top here [Music] [Music] so yeah this might take you 20 minutes or so but it's well worth it [Music] we're close i think we've got about eight and a half minutes so far [Music] all right so let's see what we got here [Music] guys okay [Music] it's going to be a long snake and then the other is going to be a wrap you can see how brittle it is [Music] you gotta go relatively quick with this because of the consistency of the material being so shattering yeah it's nice to and then once i get it kind of funnel shaped like that that'll wrap nice i'll stick it up where it's kind of warm up here just so it's plow palatable if you will because of the the consistency of the material so you gotta get it warm to work with it so now what we're gonna do is we need long snakes you just gotta kind of work it everybody's got their own secret to this [ __ ] but [Music] [Music] so [Music] okay so i gotta heat it up cool it down heat it up so i like to stick it onto the edge here and then start to roll it [Music] and then when you get it about half rolled like so you a lot of times can take the if you could see that how that that's separated there so a lot of times you can do that and then you like to just you know keep it warm as you're doing it and then kind of roll it up so it's kinking the paper if you will like this again see how it's kinking the paper there and then you can kind of hold this here [Music] pull your rosin off [Music] so now you got your can of gar completely covered in just beautiful top shelf solventless rosin okay now this we're gonna get the rest of this because at this point we're gonna have to put a hemp wrap on this thing to wrap it up and put the tip on it i do like hemp wraps um i don't like to taste the tobacco in this at all the blunt wrap at all but everybody has their own preference now these wraps are kind of um they're fairly dry and to really cure right and hold everything together you need to get them kind of wet so don't be afraid to get these things wet and work the distilled water you have and you know don't soak them in water but get them nice and wet with the sprayer work them in with your fingers you want to make sure your tips on there nice and straight let's start it here you want to work it in take your time with it if anything's not quite wet enough stop and get it wet again that's our first initial seal on there um now obviously i don't like the paper any thicker than this i try to keep it just one layer up here where i'm smoking it but when i get down to the tip you know these these are often handed around to many people so i like to take some straps as you'll see and i'll strengthen the tip up where we're not going to smoke [Music] yeah it smells great i like that little fruity flavors on all these things you know it's just that's a lot i like it that's why i put the fruit at the end so you taste it first off so it gets you warms you up like oh that tastes nice so people that may be otherwise turned off from it or turned on to it so it was like that okay so now what's left is to strengthen this tip here [Music] i might need to use one more like i said i usually use two and a half or so [Music] sometimes [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so that should make it for a real nice smoke so now we're gonna let that that uh the water evaporate and dry let it set up okay now we need to make a snake and we're gonna make a snake uh wrap the snake all the way around it once it's dry and then roll the snake in isolate and then we're going to line the tip with diamonds all right no really easy way to roll a snake with [ __ ] shatter so you gotta use warmth and a lot of parchment [Music] just upright temperature and i'll start moving you like my snakes so far it's more like a worm there we go there we go there we go oh there we go don't stop me now it's still a worm slightly bigger one but i finally got my count okay so let's zero this [Music] 1.2 that's close right about a gram okay [Music] [Applause] so now i got some thca some isolate just gonna get it warm between the plates here so then i'm gonna wrap this in isolate [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] so guys here you go that's the uh that's the kind of guard it's going to last you two and a half to three hours um gonna get 20 to 30 of your closest friends high as hell and uh this is an absolute key to the life of the party enjoy and make sure you smoke daily", "CIzDcEwI7eU": "all right here we go you guys official sneezy review just outside the steezy downtown l.a store it's smoky it's hot it's humid but everything's gonna be okay because i

logix with our kinetics 5500 servo systems as we come around the machine here what you'll notice here is there are vacuum pucks on the bottom and the top of the pouch to open if at this stage the bottom and the top are not opened the machine will sense that along with any type of reject that would come along from the camera we'll immediately follow into the next station which is our fill at this point we are bringing in our pre-rolled joint cartons they're coming in through a bucket elevator into a vibratory feed system and into the fill station the fill station as it is being shown now dives up and down um as we're filling what this does is it allows the fill funnel to penetrate the opening of the bag to ensure that the product when it goes in the pouch is able to get in all the way if the customer would have chosen to do additional inspection at this point we would immediately look once the pouch is filled with another cognix vision inspection system if the product is in the seal at that point in time or is not all the way into the pouch when we go into our next station which is our seal station we would not seal if we were successful in sealing we would go into the next station which is our cooling and it would come out to our exit conveyor as it comes out the exit conveyor it hits a 90. and comes out and what is not installed but will be in the future is a label applicator again at this point if we have not filled and we have not sealed we will not be labeling that concludes our demonstration for the 8s235 with a bowl feeder for the pre-rolled joint cigarette cartons in a pre-made child proof pouch thank you you", "iLs3ho8cCYM": "hi everyone welcome to another west coast weed tour review i'm going to be reviewing the king roll tonight which is a cannabis infused wrapped in keith pre-rolled joint uh it is triangle mince flour and gelato oil it weighs a total of 1.3 grams it is testing pretty well at 35.57 percent thc so overall i'd say i love the presentation i think the little graphic with the guy with red eyes is kind of cute um product appeal i mean this is one of the prettier pre-roll joints infused pre-rolled joints that i've ever seen it's pretty descriptive too with the flower type and the oil type on it i'm gonna open her up i really like glass packaging for joints i think it's really pretty you know the color is a little dark for the keef um but it's not too bad really nice smells very fresh smell wow definitely getting gelato coming through which is interesting that's from the oil allegedly and then triangle mince the triangle is a pheno of og kush so that'll be fun um dry it a little bit i guess that's pretty sweet pretty funky so that's awesome like i said it says 35 thc and there's no cbd the only thing i would say about an infused joint is i don't love when there's keef on the outside just because it always drips on me um and then i'm always really skeptical of oil infused joints because they tend to clog but other than that pretty exciting wow that lit really nice pretty good flavor a little harsh from the oil i don't recognize the brand of paper but it looks like a rice paper way more into rice paper than hemp for whatever reason it has a pretty strong burn to it not gonna lie i'd say it's definitely gonna get the job done the taste is pretty palatable it's not dripping at all so i'm impressed by that although my mouth is a little sticky more information there is a qr code on the packaging so i can scan that and find more information but it does have the batch id the email i'm sorry the website not the email batch id um yeah uh and i would definitely recommend this this is a california product so anybody looking for an infused joint in california would enjoy this product i think overall i'd rate it pretty high actually probably like a seven and a half for for an infused joint yeah i'm pretty impressed thanks guys have a good rest of your night", "yai1AD7F2Vw": "these are own up to bit more you certify pothead just finishing one of my late afternoon black cousin played bleep little spin move tonight gonna be awesome a little bit different we're going to be looking at a CBB pre rope from caress so without further ado you jumps to close up alright Berzelius the Middlesboro mogees flat-band a comment section as we take a look at this CBD pre rope this is from caress that's hot Thank You say anyway um this it's 15% CBD THC right here says point 20 so it's not even like 1% THC so this is not going to get you high but the CBD and it has a bunch of other different benefits let's get this thing out the pack so we can get it close up but with this bang looks like all right so here's our CBD pre-rolled it's actually stuffed pretty tight in there says Instagram I think it might be a little bit oh we don't have to roll it it's already pre rope but since it does not have any THC on it on what I'm gonna do is won't take some of these Dabdoub put it on about half of it that way I can get a good decent idea with the flavor of it is on its own and then once D stop burning I'll get some that THC in here to twist um get this thing prepped and get it lit up all right bird club you got this caress CBD free room yes it was already rode so he basically did was be prepped it a little bit with some dabba-doo s-- as it burns those dapper dues will become more like loose and then I'll spread them all the way around it but let's go ahead and spark this up and see what the flavor profile I just see BB pre row actually is all right Burke up bout spark up this pre row this is one B actually the first help that smoked smells coming off of it now is just tudor be dead like the first in the distance see what the first side street is I'm expecting it to kinda just be rolling paper it may be a vegetative kind of scent but let's see there may be some real nice terpenes and help but I'll figure that out as you smoke you know the first size do smell is basically just rolling paper the smell of bleach paper there's a scent of burning vegetation - there's no like we smell of marijuana presence on there at all just take your first pool see what it tastes like well that that taste was actually like some very very terrible poop like some very very bad weep the burning of plant material between hemp and marijuana is very similar you can get that in the taste of it what you don't get is any other turf paint ASIS there's basically just a straight plant like them with like taste it is burning pretty good and it is really relaxing um oh yeah even even just those couple fools this it's made me make me feel a little bit relaxed see if I can spear these dad's out little fire without much don't let this thing heat up some more free smoke that is that is a very relaxing kind of portal hey I feel I feel my body going into a state of relaxation like every every time I pull this it was just deal like no turfy taste is getting right to the spot where these devs are gonna meet Bernie dam started to get some of that turf penis from your dad's coming through it's not really strong yet it's just like right at the beginning of the day of smear this is again this is a very relaxing joint the ash is a little dark though you see all that holy water aerated burn that Ash is dark I'm not like that darkness I'm thinking I would get a good Debbie taste right there but it's not it's mostly just a veget 'iv and tastes still okay there I've got some of that turvy damn they still you know with the dams burning over top of that we still taste like like some pretty bad poop um dad there's no there's no there's not like the strong thickness of wheat Burnie then aside stream that has that strong terpene taste though or that strong terpene smell it's a very very nice Terp Terp it takes the VOSA is dis if you can get chance on some of these CBD pre roads give them a try let me know how you felt smoking it like again for me very nice relaxing feeling it the taste of it is leaves a lot to be desired especially if you thinking that you're gonna get like a marijuana taste because you don't get that from the setup then when dad's are burning they still taste like pretty pretty low grade marijuana that's because there's so much help in here that it's like polluting it tastes not bad though forever like a real stressful day I'm smoke the rest additional five no Instagram it to of Mari Twitter - but Mari Facebook it to memory live I was actually thinking it when the dam started burning that it the taste of it would would resembles a pretty good marijuana but it doesn't it's like it's like some like the taste of some really low quality Reggie but with the dad's burning our young being high from before that it was just a really relaxing smoke now it's like real relaxing hi we don't take my word for it if you see them give them a try you get some depth there's some dabs on them and let me know I was there for you with that you two-bit

you came to chill cuz I would like to introduce this full Grand Prix roll of hazelnut cream produced by canna beta a sativa flower it's a full gram for only $13 I want to shout out LV cannabis reviews from making this all possible if you want to see my full review of this hazelnut cream just check out lv-426 because on the label here they provide so much data not only do we get to see the THC total which is twenty five point thirty seven percent that's baked beginners beware but we also get to see one two three four five six seven eight different terpenes listed most the time in Vegas only see three terpenes on the label the most dominant terpene is tur pendulum at twelve point four milligrams tarpon Helene has got some herbal sedate of effects maybe even some honey flavors some interesting how that's gonna play into this being a sativa strain and it having a hazelnut cream title cuz I'm really expecting some chocolate nutty chocolate nutty milky taste I'm sure what his pre roll looks like here mmm there's definitely some floral herbal scent system kind of a expresso kind of burnt sour smell Wow I think this pre-roll was hand rolled their way it was twisted it's got a squiggly filter at the end and we looked at all the data here got a chance to smell it but the full review will be on LV cannabis reviews calm and we won't really know the high we smoked it so let's get into

show you how the color of tube could affect your brand new custom shrink sleeves from cool jars so you've just worked with our design team and created the perfect custom shrink sleeves for your products and now it's time to order your tubes or bottles the color of tube could drastically affect your custom shrink sleeves and how they turn out one misconception is having a special or different color tube than your competitor but our custom cool jars shrink sleeves are now your billboard our pro tip is recommending the use of our regular white tubes or bottles for your packaging they'll allow your custom shrink sleeves to pop bringing out the whites and lighter colors for more true tone using darker or even brighter colors will highly change the look of your custom shrink sleeves a close second would be our clear bottles or tubes as they still give that blank canvas for your artwork to look great here's a look at a custom designed shrink sleeve across all of our basic colors and how the appearance changes first the white and clear which are great choices the white is just a bit brighter than the clear our greens blues and purples really alter the tone of the shrink sleeves smoke and black are probably the worst options as they really mute the appearance of the sleeves comparing the black tube to the white tube really shows the difference well there you have it a quick

[Music] watching [Music] you", "yJLvgnTZlps": "hello everyone today I'm here to show you our newest cone filling machine the sluice box the sluice box is made right here in the USA and in this video I'm going to show you exactly what comes with the sluice box how to set up the sluice box and how to fill pre-rolled cones with our newest pre-roll machine so let's get started your sluice box will come with a vibrating base a lower cartridge upper cartridge metal tray a set of dividers and if you got the ninety-eight and 109 mm setup then it will come with a set of risers to increase the height of the cartridge when doing 109 millimetre cones there is also an optional attachment the tamping attachment and I'll go over more over this tool on how to use it later in this video but essentially it helps to compress down the cones and provide a better overall pre-roll so let me show you now how to put this all together in order to set up this sluice box it's highly recommended that you purchase a rubber mat to place on the bottom of the sluice box that's in order to catch any excess material reduce vibration on the machine and reduce movement of the machine once you have your workstation set up it's very easy to set up the sluice box you would essentially first place the metal tray onto the vibrating base you would then take the lower cartridge and place that on to the metal tray once you have that placed on to the metal tray you are essentially ready to load the cones and you would load the cones individually one slot for one cone per slot there are 325 slots on the 98 and 109 millimetre setup and there are 406 slots on the 84 millimetre setup once you have loaded the cones into the lower cartridge you are now ready to place the upper cartridge on top and load the Cannabis you would simply grab the upper cartridge place it on top and then you are ready to load the Cannabis into the cones in order to start the vibration on the machine you simply press the button down here and you in short bursts now that you know basically how to set up the sluice box let's do an example run so you can see exactly how this machine works let me quickly show you how to load cones into the sluice box as you can see like most vibrating filling machines you place the cones into the sluice box at one slot per time if any of the cones are sticking up slightly all you have to do is gently press the palm of your hand against the top of the surface to press the cones down now all the clones are loaded you place the upper cartridge on top and you begin to spread your material you use the vibration on the machine to help further spread the material and help get the material to fall through into the cone once the material has fallen through you simply remove the upper cartridge and you'll see on the lower cartridge that there is some excess material on top what we'll want to do is we'll want want to run the vibration for a little bit longer and spread the material to make sure that our cones are well packed so let's just do that now that everything is well packed at this point we're ready to use the tamping tool in order to use the tamping tool you simply place it on top of the of the lower cartridge and you put the amount of pressure that you want to achieve your perfect tamp the tamp basically helps to create a better overall compression on the pre rolls and make sure that it's really well packed towards the crotch and at the top this creates a better burn and overall smoking experience so now that it's been pretty well tamped here let's compare the two pre-rolls one that's been tamped with a tamping tool and one that has not been tamped at all if you need to add more flour to your cones then we can repeat the process placing the upper cartridge on top again spreading more material and then doing the tamping process again the sluice box really allows you to customize your packing and tamping process in order to create the perfect pre roll some may want to do may want to fill it just halfway and then do a tamp and then fill the remaining amount and doing a final round of tamping whereas others they want to fill most of the material out first and then just do one round of tamping what you end up doing is highly dependent on your preferred smoke grind size fill weight and strength the sluice box lead time is one to two weeks and it is made in the USA the machine comes with one set of cartridges for either 84 millimeter or 98 and 109 millimetre cones additional cartridges can be purchased and the motor comes with a one-year warranty thank you for watching this video and please visit us at thank you [Music]", "YBEiwAE4PHs": "here we go here we go here we go sherbinsky's fairfax hollywood man i finally got it

honestly like I mean when you look at the history of cannabis that's the big things that that's what it really like hits home for me is that cannabis has historically been used as a tool for racism so to not recognize it as cannabis ambassadors feels like pretty blind be a part of it the Allies the anti race we've been reading some books lately we've been trying to educate ourselves and then our most recent vlog you know I've been going to protest as well they've died down a little bit here in LA but um but yeah it's it's it feels important to speak up and be part of this movement yeah be on the right side of history here and yeah we appreciate every single one of you that has told us in some way shape or fashion that you like our agreement with us and you support us cuz yeah this is this is a community you know and I want to feel that you know the that we're not going to be totally like blind to the world but that we can actually come together for the things that like we're passionate about passion about weed we're also passionate about you know justice also shoutouts thank you everyone for giving me the nice hair compliments I'm seeing in the chat here I love love the new hair looks nice yeah thank you this is the result of not going to the hairdresser or the the salon since like before all of this went down I think less time I got my hair cut was before I went to Europe in March so yeah yeah we're seeing what's happening it's growing but I'm think thank you guys for for compliments that's very sweet I think a compliment should be followed by a dad for the lady 710 we're taking a DAB out of this jell-o jell-o no it's banana split banana split chevensky card I know you know you like it when like seventeen you thought that we were gonna take it dad oh so guys I'm les she's saying pretty excited for what we have coming out for our seven ten video Friday it's this Friday happy 710 week everybody yeah yeah seventeen week hey I can easily say like yeah our 710 video coming out this Friday is definitely like top three highest that we've ever been on the channel yeah it's a good one it's a very good one right oh my god this is the face of a pen is like not gonna be a thing and then whole that's just smacks face suddenly this is the like double fisting but I was ready for him just like Oh get it get it BAM oh I see Jessie asking if it tastes like a banana split that is just the strain so it definitely tastes I'm trying to think um it has a rind miss to it like to me it's like banana runts as a candy you know but not candy flavored it's not it's not a flavored vape it is it is a cannabis terpene profile it's not it doesn't have like extra candy flavor put into it and stuff sorry um it does have kind of a sweet cannabis taste a little bit of yeah like it's a kind of a rind in there sort of a fruity sort of something but it's definitely not like banana split flavored yeah yeah guys we ever get to that future which I feel like we're well on our way then just like oh man that's a just giving my banana split flavored weed string even though something that we did very recently that felt very futuristic was this drive-thru dispensary that was fun that was all the way out in the desert a little bit of a drive but like totally worth it because that was a very just like trippy experience that was like oh we're in the future what is going on yeah I I didn't even realize so I looked up and London it's California's first drive-through dispensary which is crazy to me because that implies that there will be more and that is so cool and so crazy and I know that there's already I think like a couple in NorCal and honestly saying like how how well that video is doing on the channel thank you for all of that love and likes and engagement um I would love to make that like a series for the channel or something just I would I would go through every drive-thru right reoccurring series just getting weed from the car in a legal sense sounds like oh this but this feels so new and yet so familiar I'm never getting out of cars alright um we also went on a fun adventure recently to the lavender fields out at Highland Springs Ranch of LA last year they and I guess normally every year they do a lavender festival that we went to for the first time last year that had a bunch of different vendors and booths and food and we had a tea party and it was amazing we went on like a hayride and this year because of kovat 19 everything is canceled but they still allowed you to do reservations to come in and like socially distance walk through the lavender field with a mask on and like separated and only letting a certain number of people come in at a certain time and stuff so that was actually still a lot of fun and super chill to just like go out there and walk through that and I think that will be on our patreon already there already on the patreon I love it what we a lot of the times I came even in quarantine even with everything we we do try to you know get out when we can and whenever I feel like it's at least an adventure worth remembering in the future something I like I want a document for like ourselves one tends to go up on patreon because a lot of times there's nothing to do with we but it is very personal to us so patreon calm if you actually want to get a little bit inside look into our live because we have passions outside of we'd just like ashtrays we're just so kind of it's so pretty in the pocket that was my segue my transition into take a minute and appreciate good baby joints out of like the world's most baby ashtray it's just a tiny little house and then when you put your when you put your joint in there how cute is that how cute is that yeah we actually have another one very similar to this it's a little bit bigger this one is a slightly tinier house yeah we got both of them at pygmy hippo if you type in pygmy hippo shop on Google you'll find it um and I think usually actually they have a bunch of ashtrays that you can order online but because they're vintage it's all like a kind of one-off she curates and she finds all these great vintage pieces that she then sells in her store so a lot of them like it is a one of one that exists but I have seen her have other little houses - so pygmy hippo shoutout to them pygmy hippo I love you even has like a stamp on the bottom that's just like like proof of the kind of porcelain factory in Japan so family like Oh charreteras antique chairs that yeah we're about that's also definitely featured in one of our previous live streams we go through our entire ashtray collection it was a fun one that was a fun one yeah like I like anything where I'm just like okay we get to like smoke through a collection of things I'm trying to think we've also been on a couple of socially distance picnics that have been fun when I'm one with a couple of friends we all just like said our blankets out like six feet apart from each other and didn't share any food or anything and then just going on a couple just us two um when I'm one over fourth of July weekend that was just like very chill it's just nice to at least like get out of the house and like the weather is nice in LA right now so it's nice picnicking in a park is something that you can like still feel like okay as long as I really am way out spread out from everybody and I've got some shade and it's sunny and it's breezy I don't feel like I'm too much at risk or anything out there so yeah we definitely make sure that we're like well because I think we also like to like take a little like exactly and upset any families or anything we're looking for the the back spot in the corner under that one tree back there anyway so yeah but picnics have been I've been a fun little way to at least get out of the house and try and like pick up some food eat it on a picnic blanket and then come back and keep working from home cuz it's crazy guys that we are still both just on work from home mode at the dabbing cabin right guys March I think this is crazy I think yeah actually honestly really that has to be the biggest like crazy update that I know this is not the normal day-to-day for a lot of people but for both of us to transition from office jobs to now like we work in the same room like you have seen the davon cabinet or you've seen how tiny this studio apartment really nosy baby yeah and and yeah like it's crazy the the desk that I used to like edit and do YouTube is now the desk that I use for like all of my work and it's just like like we are it's nice um that we are always pretty much in like eyesight almost like with each other more or less ooh the day but it's like oh man I know that that that also would like break I feel like a lot of other like newer couples like thinking this were at least like said we're married we're good and but we're used to it yeah you get a lot more like snuggle time with the cat well I just had lunch so why not hit up the cat yeah it's been we are we are very fortunate though the like has to be said that we both have jobs that we can like work from home and you know we both have our health actually because of you know a recent participation in the protests and everything we thought it was like the safest next step for us to go get kovin 19 testing done as the drive for through testing at the Dodger Stadium which I now know is like closed so we were like some of the last like tests it sounds like to go through it which is wild and yeah I'm right now like working on that potentially is another video for like the channel I don't know might be patreon lobbying channel let me know when you guys actually be interested in seeing us like on camera yeah and check our results and all that stuff in the full process it's not necessarily like a lot of cannabis in it at all or smoking-related I belong to say I think we we do smoke at the end but um but yeah would you guys be interested in something that's like less less weed focused and like more I guess just current events at the fact that it's yeah just Co vid testing it's crazy um but yeah that was definitely was an interesting experience so either way that'll be a fun vlog for that to go out yeah I think I think it's so fun there like that and the drive through dispensary wild experiences of 2020 all done within just like sitting in my car right yeah so crazy alright I think I think the the bingo card that we still have to cross off is the drive movie theater we've still yet been yeah but that's very doable it's very doable there's a bunch of um popping up they're just all selling out very quickly we're finding out so we just got to get tickets for one oh I love it I know we've got some q and a's here god you just finished that first what I mean are you gonna strike second one I feel like we should share take a second I love ya we can kick off the kuna cuz I love seeing some great questions even coming into the chat one of the first ones is yeah just like asking about like Alice do you still work at Jeep and like yeah Japan yes definitely still full Jeep and fan um yeah so they don't love your smoking on mono don't mind you consuming yes certainly not it is it is encouraged at my place of work yeah I am I'm lucky enough to be working for a very progressive like california-based social media based company so ya know I am yeah we were great we I couldn't I appreciate it every single day that we find ourselves in a position where we're both in the professional world like I am definitely in corporate America but yeah I like most of most of my co-workers once I know I'm a little smoky secret no I like to keep it that way I'm a Scorpio we're secretive questions oh I love this question from Aaron are you are you currently growing so yeah so early into the beginning phases of our season for season four North Grove North Grove Road Ronal where we will see what popped a couple of these seeds these are show them to the camera these are for fathers is tangerine cookies hey first time growing was seed that's a big deal um we're in the stage where we've done the paper towels and the plates and they've they've sprouted and popped and then we got cups and we put soil and we put the seeds into the soil and now we are watering them and waiting for them to sprout up oh yeah fingers crossed it works out this is our first time not growing from a clown so um they could be duds they could be male yeah there's a lot lot more things that go wrong not a lot more maybe just those two but still early stages early stages but yes you posted but you're very excited we literally just started that like it's coming coming exactly you're growing fingers crossed I got a show I'm seeing someone Cyrus coming in desperate to know very aggressive have you seen have you taken a weed break have you - um yes yeah we don't schedule out tolerance breaks necessarily we tend to take them naturally when we are either traveling mm-hmm or under the weather yeah um so no use forcing a high if you're like under it yeah I know exactly yeah I just don't think you know yeah luckily we've we've never gotten to a point where we're like oh I feel like if I took a break that it would really help my cannabis and take and my tolerance and everything that it would be beneficial for me in that way I've never reached that level where I feel like I need to do that so I feel like taking breaks naturally enough cuz we do a couple times a year at least um with traveling or being sick is is is good and healthy yeah yeah exactly yeah I feel like whatever just doesn't actually thankfully I'm never and yeah like I do naturally if I feel like I need to take rice Oh God also I finished my joints and I can pull up the Instagram question switch off switching that off KJ I'm also seeing another question coming it like going to LA for the first time since we use recreational what is a good first time dispensary to go to that's no life God we I cuz I love we we have at least a two video series where you go to every dispensary in Hollywood a lot of good ones here but if you're two of them in West Hollywood yes that we each gave their own video if you want to see like inside of them because I think they both are amazing for first timers because herbarium you can literally like look into a window and see them growing yep uber areum is also I think their bud tenders and staff are trained very well to handle a lot of first-timers they are in not a super touristy part of Hollywood but also not necessarily off the beaten path eater neither yeah touristy friendly area of Hollywood so I feel like they are used to getting a lot of people out of town that is their first time experience so they're like very prepared to handle that and kind of embrace that which I enjoy also and we would be the artist tree this is a art gallery slash it's the kind of dispenser you're gonna go home after you visit LA and be like yo you guys would not believe this art museum we're growing weed in the middle of the room and you can like walk up to the plant it feels like it's out of a movie it's a very very big store that is laid out very cool just wall to wall very cool displayed products that you can just kind of like go up to and look not a lot of stuff is like behind a counter or behind a bar or anything it's all behind glass but you can still go up and get very close to it and it just covers like all of this space and then they have these really cool big art pieces that are for sale and by local artists and as Clark said they actually have a full grow going on in the middle of the room that you can walk into and touch the plants and like it is very very cool I love someone it's also shouting off the pottery and round that out as number three that's that's a good pottery is and a little bit more of a residential area I would say urban area man and the artist tree are very much like we're a tourist would still go versus the pottery feels a little bit more well turn what pottery is actually close to Leo's tacos oh you go to the pottery get a taco at the Leos taco trucks been like a couple blocks away worth going over there for that very local foods best taco truck there will be a line but it's worth it Spencer giving you the we taco combo lockdown at the pottery is very cool as well they have a lot to offer it's a super cool vibe in there it feels like a cool store that you'd want to like pull your phone out and take picture and [ __ ] there are the bud tenders they are also all very knowledgeable and the pottery sells a lot of cool accessories too if you're looking to pick up some cool like cannabis souvenirs like a cool like jar or vaporizer or glass or something or even shirts the pottery has a lot of that cool merchants accessories as well yeah yeah I do love that it feels like a kind of like cool boutique superstore feeling feeling that baby that was a it's a noisy cricket it's a lot um ooh I love okay we'll start up here um how do you handle fights in a tiny home oh I love it we kind of talked about that about like working from home together yeah um but yeah we do live in a very tiny home um and luckily I don't want to lie and say like we don't we don't ever fight but I feel like our fights are always resolved in the time that like if a fight is started it is ended and it has a we are moving on and we are not mad at each other and not that long amount of time has passed wow I'm high and feel like I just explained that a very bad way but I hope you got it listen fights don't take that long before we can just realize whatever we're fighting about is silly and just get back to like normal and not fighting mode like it's easy answers yeah we get high every day and this is always right there we go let's say we go okay that's an easy I'll that's that's an easy life guys that's that's easy right I love it but ya know if I never win if we've never gone to bed angry I feel like that's a very like cliche thing I've heard before or even felt the need to like I need to get out of the apartment and neither of us has been angry enough to be like I'm leaving and going elsewhere I need to get in my car and drive or I need to just go too far to the distance my literally you know maybe it the most okay I'm you watch TV and I'm gonna go do the dishes right now but like not even that because like yeah we wouldn't leave the room if we were still like in a fight like I don't know it works out a very good relationship we're very lucky very communicative yes we're so so we we [ __ ] love talking to each other we love talking to you guys now never stops love it besties for life do you know any places to get products with high CBD content and low THC content just looking on the chat here okay high CBD content low teens um I would always just ask a budtender if you can go to a place as a budtender on staff cuz I don't know if there's a place that like specializes you know anything yeah it would be better to go to a store if you're looking for something that has some THC in it because almost anything that you're gonna get online is going to be the legal like less than 0.3% I think it is THC that's allowed to be in CBD that's sold online so like I know like Japan just released new cookies CBD geo cartridges that are super cool and can ship to most stage most states nationwide but I don't think those have any THC in the malls at all and like yeah that would be my go-to for something that like anyone watching would be able to get but yeah if you have the ability to go to a store and ask a budtender for yeah something that just has that good mix for you oh if you're in California I will say poppin Berkeley has a bunch of good mix THC CBD products yeah yeah I like whatever yeah we can try to help when ya even have a question firm Larry I've been trying edibles for the first time but they haven't had any effect is it possible that it's a bad product for me getting tired of spending like $30 for these items so I definitely think them like edibles is something that I used to think yeah you know like didn't work for me but then yeah I tried the right brand or the right concentration and stuff I definitely feel like because I know how big a variety that there is the edibles to say for anyone to say that edibles across-the-board doesn't work for them I'm like okay I I would be cure I would be curious to see like what other like because there's tinctures there's like higher concentration recommend looking into potentially making your own edibles if you have any kind of a weed vaporizer and you're able to save your vape tweed afterwards that's been decarboxylated already and you can save that and then turn that into cotta butter and try and just experiment with some of your own dosages I guess you would say of just like how much to put in there and then you're not wasting necessarily twenty to thirty bucks per per edible you're getting at the store I would also maybe yes like its Clark was saying like try try a different kind there are tinctures a liquid might hit you different than a solid maybe just even trying a different brand of something if you're just going to candy maybe try try a gummy ifsar like a brownie to a to a gummy of some kind or something just a different way for your body to try and absorb that THC that's true yeah because it's like it's gonna digest a brownie very differently than a lemonade and everything and I would also recommend yeah if you can look into making your own edibles at home and figuring out what works for you that way that could just be a good money saver for sure my favorite nestle is gonna say almost lost a member when you have a high thought and you're like oh no it's gone forever snatched it my one of my favorite at home like edible things you can make it's just you know edible butter I feel like that's everyone's kind of go to make it a compound butter with different chopped up like scallions and minced garlic yeah and then you use that butter just slice it off and cook it with steaks like I feel like so many people think about sweet like butter and sweet edible it's like if you're really like down for some edibles like see oh my goodness cook yourself just something with butter that's savory you'll enjoy compound butter is exotic bud worth it this question okay I actually are stickers worth it or our fast cars worth it like yeah some people okay now to me reverence I have a slightly different opinion on that I feel like exotic is a very hot button vocabulary word right now that is getting used a lot is like adjectives to describe any kind of like not blue dream [ __ ] strain that you've heard of before exactly but it's would you call it an exotic like watching yeah so I don't know I think I mean we're very spoiled living in California that pretty much anything that we go to at our dispensaries is going to be just good quality and lab tested and going to get the job done so personal opinion if you're living in California like no just go to the store get get witness train you like don't need to necessarily go exotic with it if you're living in an illegal state oh don't dress yeah California bud is exotic to you like I will say California has the best bud but in general I don't think like yeah putting I feel like putting exotic over a strain name is is very much just like a yeah a seller kind of vocabulary word yes there are exotic strains yes that exists I'm not saying that that whole realm doesn't exist exotic strains are a thing but I feel like it's morphed into something that's become more of just a word to sell in push strains then actually it is truly something exotic that's true but I don't know and if you are gonna spend that much money on weed at least make sure it's lab tested that it's like it is coming from a shop anyone that's just like you bro this is my exotic out of those likes yeah exactly or even even a [ __ ] it's crazy the [ __ ] bags that they sell that like [ __ ] I don't even want to get into it [ __ ] black market isn't saying them um let's see here go to munchies spot I will say we live in Hollywood it seems like oily are our go-to though I'm a big fan of Joe's pizza and Hollywood Boulevard and right down the street there's a Popeye's Chicken we are now it's not a it's not beneath us we're not above a Popeye's Chicken here's what I figured out popeyes chicken sandwich stacked up against a chick-fil-a chicken sandwich as someone who was raised on chick-fil-a sandwiches pop ice like consistently is doing better it's it's a better body it's good yeah Discover's Joe's pizza in LA is like my favorite pizza it's so good just a New York style Joe's yeah so good so that's been the go-to munch you spot lately one of those two places where a house divided when it comes to pizza I think my favorite is Detroit style like thick crust like crispy hard cheese on there lots of soft yeah I'm all my bread and sauce she like hates good bread lots of cheese um let's see here um have you been saving your Dee carp weed from your - oh I love someone asking that like goes back to animals um to be honest no I haven't because we don't really yeah we don't really make our own edibles that much so there's no need for me to save it but that is like exactly what I was talking about so yeah I think that's the coolest thing is that if you are vaping dry herb that you don't have to throw it away that these like burnt up bits can actually continue can like pull every amount of THC out of it to me it's like such an ultimate Buffalo move it's like every part of it we're using all of it um let's see here um what'd you guys go to when if you get too high here CBD is a good remedy okay I can get too high um I think we did a full video on this actually what you do if you're too high a while ago alright yes yeah I wanna say maybe over a year I remember being surprised that black pepper because has a beta cario Filene in it which is a terpene that actually like for some reason kind of like snaps you out of the high affect like right so smell some black pepper know some black CBD you can definitely help um also I feel like sleep is is something - if I just get too high just go to sleep and I wake up and I'm fine so and then say I feel like I'm the office because I know a lot of people also use like exercise so just like okay I'm gonna like try just like work it out and like sweat it out and stuff and just like okay yeah like it's too high I feel like only gotten there with like edibles right it's true it's very true no um let's see what are your favorite methods of getting high also we're not smoking right now favorite methods of getting high I would probably say smoking out of my glass bong and I think lurk would say dabs yes I am definitely a fan of dabs I recently got a new quartz banger from bare quartz super super excited and with that what's that thing I'm like oh yeah that was a purchase well worth it yeah old-school with the quartz banger old-school a lot of different um let's see here did y'all get sick from the coronavirus or do you know anyone that got sick luckily yeah oh yeah I guess all right we're not sick now you can watch our video coming out soon very thankful we didn't know no one in our family um got sick or has gotten sick knock on wood um yeah yeah we've been very lucky I'll say that um BAM a favorite horror movie don't worry we're not big horror movie people cuz cabin in the woods count as a horror movie yeah that's a great cuz that's that's definitely my answer anything with any horror movie with Thorin my not so smart it's funny there's a classic story classic theory but it's also funny it's more funny than scary oh my god these joints oh no we're getting high okay no just yeah back to back I remember I watched a lot more growing up but I'm just not a fan of like the horror like jump cuts and stuff I remember like watching so much just oh I don't like to trash [ __ ] jeepers creepers just oh I saw the ring in middle school and it really freaked me out I don't do it no it was not a fun time um let's see here me and my boyfriend love your channel ah thank you what's one piece of advice for young couples love it that's a good question I'd love to give relationship advice I think that would be so much fun guys we just like turn this into our own little just like okay next like whatever couple of minutes relationship cue nice girl what you want um I'm trying like okay one piece of advice for young couples um I mean it's basic but just communication is so key to just like honestly never assume the other person is a mind reader and just like always yeah if this is what you're thinking and this is what you want if you can break it down to like what do I want out of this situation and just communicate that to your partner and they can do the same for you and communicate this is what I want then like yeah you shouldn't you shouldn't run into that many issues I feel like yeah just gotta yeah communicate and let each other know and just yeah you cannot be afraid to talk to each other yeah I feel like it's so cliche and basic but like it's so true and I feel like so many I don't know I would hear people at like co-workers and stuff at like previous jobs that would just be involved with such drama and so just like oh I'm not gonna text him so that like he knows that you know he's upset me or something but I'm like if you want to talk to him and you want to resolve this then why are you not texting him to teach him away just little petty things like that that's just like you're mad so you're not gonna text him but if you really you truly want him to talk to you then you should talk to him like you know I don't know just don't don't get caught up in any of that drama [ __ ] ya know um I think my thing but I would piggyback off of that is also like don't be afraid to just be yourself at like all like times up I feel like there's like I don't know there's there's almost no barrier to like if they thought if any kind of random crazy batshit thought comes into my head that I think will give myself a chuckle I'm like oh I'm sharing it with her yeah like first and it's like if if the person that you're with isn't like your go-to person just to like just to talk about life and just to just you know like just be open ya wheel with and to like be vulnerable in front of and to know that like you can you can just talk about like everything I don't know you had the amount of times for certain guys just like oh no I can I can only talk to my significant other about like XYZ and I'm just like it's languages there should be there's no why restricts yourself like it's so much easier this way why would you why would you like good you're put restrictions on your own life like well it's like I get it not everyone is just like who's lucky lucky to exactly be at that point to be able to recognize that they're a G self in front of let's see what's your favorite movie to watch hi your watch hi I mean like blue planet is just like it feels like always ins always gonna write any of that planet Earth stuff it's something watching a doc because there's like a lot of times never story to it especially yeah animal doctor just jumpy and you're just learning shape like your Sokka I didn't know that like [ __ ] yeah Doc's are great um I'm trying to think across the universe it's a fun one if you've never seen that that's all Beatles music and there's more cool [ __ ] visuals in that and that's an OK story got [ __ ] West world chick in it um yes yes anything I'm trying to think yes strong like visuals and stuff I mean she's been I a lot of times like I'm enough of a nerd that I will fall back to just like the Marvel movies the Marvel movies still like oh I have such a good like just return on like investment in terms of right you're really high and just banjo though there's I mean there's a couple like that are better than others there's a couple flops in there but most of them are [ __ ] amazing right we did we did get high and watch the last two Avengers movie I just randomly yeah was great all of the movies are there to make you go like holy [ __ ] at least a couple of times and just to make you just like like not to make you like shake your brain too much I felt like that's the reason why don't watch a lot of horror movies that are like I don't want to think about something that it says cotton just trying to kill me it follows I don't want to think about something but it's like always just trying to get at me like no no I want to watch this Tony Stark punch a robot and a mouth like thank you okay that's okay I guess the question was like what if you like when you get high sometimes such what you need I love seeing this question in the chat this was also one on Instagram too of do you guys plan on having kids in the future exactly for a couple married and doing well and stuff right now we don't have any plans to have kids in the future but yeah it's something that we've like discussed and I don't know yeah I feel like it's really like yeah I don't know like I love whenever I've talked to like what I would consider like very like oh happy healthy like parents they totally understand that it's like Parenthood isn't for everyone and it's just like yeah and I feel like it's it's nice that if we can be at least like examples of like that because I feel like that's something I just don't see like enough I don't know yeah just like yeah okay we're a happy happy couple us us and our cat gotta for a baby that we're very very happy with and yeah don't plan on changing that anytime soon so yeah love it but like yeah exactly if you are on

tim how y'all doing how y'all being so today we're gonna be doing something a little different everybody been asking me you know what's the best pre-roll this and that you know i didn't already told y'all that i don't really [ __ ] with pre-rolls because most of the companies put [ __ ] in them you know so today i'm gonna expose i got 10 pre-rolls and i'm going to expose them for who they really are you know what i'm saying because me myself i'm not going to pay no five to ten dollars for a bunch of [ __ ] shake you know what i'm saying but in a minute i'm gonna cut these open you know if it's blood i'll re-roll them up if it's not then i'll trash them but i will not be buying no [ __ ] shake i can promise you that so we're going to put them to the test man we're going to put them to the test first one we got is kush crafted 23.7 tac 1.438 terps 0.06 dbd it's a hybrid let's see what we got here folks well would you look at that well would you look at that [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] there ain't no bud in that who was this who is this right here that's [ __ ] right there guys i'll tell you what if we gonna do this [ __ ] let's do it all the [ __ ] way huh if we gonna do it let's do it all the way if we want to do this so we know it's [ __ ] did they at least give us what we paid for oh you give us what we paid for huh yep i guess they did well at least it's what it says it weighs it says it's a grime and it's the ground but you can see it's all powdery shake so that's a bus [ __ ] you might mix it up on your doobies or something you know on your roaches all right next company we got tangelo or strawberry cheese they're the same [ __ ] company so i ain't even gonna open up that one this one is strawberry cheese 11.81 t ac damn that's [ __ ] ridgey 1.67 terpenes they gave me some [ __ ] richie [ __ ] with [ __ ] eleven percent yeah you see i got brick we got 14 17. let's see here what we got what we got there's a butter [ __ ] it's [ __ ] you see how many of these little [ __ ] sticks that are in here right here that's how you know it's [ __ ] it's coming off of these leaves see those little sticks ain't coming out of the bud it's coming off them a little bitty ass leaves least all of this [ __ ] is [ __ ] it's been packed so it looked like it got little buds but it don't but it does have more than what the other one did but i mean like you could just tell from the sticks you know that it's the bottom of the bag it ain't where somebody has taken a bag full of buds and broke them down into some fine ground premium weed to stuff these cones you see what i'm saying when you see these leafy sticks and [ __ ] like that you know damn well they come from the bottom of the bag i mean you almost got by with that one you know what i'm saying it's got some little you know buddy type nugs off in there but our real players already know you know what i'm saying that's just some [ __ ] off the top of the bag that wasn't big enough for you to throw in the bud power because i can tell by these sticks that you know you on your corner all right so the tgs was a bust moving on to my buddy it's a hybrid she's got so many [ __ ] numbers on here i don't know which one to read to you i ain't gonna be no liar so here we go there's going to be another one i can already tell yup straight powder straight powder that's some [ __ ] right there i went out and spent a lot of money today guys because i don't want you to get [ __ ] i don't want you to get ripped off i don't want you to go out here and buy this [ __ ] thinking you're getting a good deal get a big ass stick right there huh who took the time to break weed down you don't leave sticks and seeds in there you know what i'm saying so that's how i know my [ __ ] take their time with this [ __ ] you know because if you see that big ass stick you're not going to try to stuff it in that cone because you're scared it might rip the cone that's way fat see what i'm saying i'm 120 you know but am i am i lying you know what i'm saying call me on my [ __ ] if i'm lying bro it says call me on my [ __ ] this is all trash this is all trash my buddy medicinals that's all shaped that's all shake be honest when you break down your buds you get all your sticks and seeds out of there but when you got them cones in that slapbox and all that other [ __ ] you just dump all that [ __ ] shake down there and let it do the rest fill them up if you pull a cone out and it's [ __ ] up you bust it back down and start over we'll see if you're doing that [ __ ] by hand with carrot you you know i'm saying you couldn't afford to do all that work and then rip a [ __ ] cone so let's see now we got some jack hair a pure cannabis pre-roll chill out i'm trying to shoot a video made by twisted 18 thc 20 point 26 zbd see what we got here i can tell you now this is [ __ ] here i can tell you now see everybody is doing this shake [ __ ] and i'm here to show you this man don't go and spend your money on that look at how much look at them little cheap grams they got at least this [ __ ] bud it's got more thc crystals on it than this [ __ ] shake see we gonna put these [ __ ] out of this [ __ ] they're gonna find something else to do with this [ __ ] trash they gonna make some [ __ ] [ __ ] ass vape carts or something you know what i'm saying but they ain't gonna keep putting them off on you know saying the elderly and the newbies you know what i'm saying [ __ ] newborns coming out here getting a [ __ ] car you know what i'm saying going over there getting this [ __ ] [ __ ] because they got some fat ass names on it and [ __ ] you know what i'm saying like oh we want that we heard about that pineapple express then you get home and that [ __ ] is some [ __ ] but you're a newbie so you know you got off the [ __ ] i gotta say this looks better but it's still trash you can smell the leaf in it i mean it's i think that one might have a little extra hash in it i might if i was going to purchase any of them so far it would be to twist it i'm going to re-roll that up in mia blunt here we have devil's crack this is from gray's farm 28.33 1.10 cbd 2.59 terps 28 or 23.83 thc is what it said 23 well let's see what we got here guys let's see what we got [Applause] that's got hella [ __ ] keeping it see that's that's how they'd be trying to get a [ __ ] you know saying where you can say you still got eye off the [ __ ] you know because they feeling all that [ __ ] keep in there you know like hash you know what i'm saying i didn't cost him nothing but an extra step you know what i'm saying and some dry ice i'll probably be mixing that too just cause the fact i can see so much yeah i might have to mix that too okay i mean those two have been doctored see what i'm saying them they went ahead and just gave you what they had at least that company is throwing some extra [ __ ] in there for you you know what i'm saying because they already know they're giving you [ __ ] you know so that's when they trying to make it up on the same thing with the [ __ ] hot dollar ones that say they got the little uh oil and all that keef and [ __ ] well we don't make a [ __ ] if the inside is just trash you know what i'm saying you put that [ __ ] on some weed you got something but when you put it on some trash you just got [ __ ] trash that's all it is all right so the last one for this one let's do this sublime green crack and this [ __ ] say it's a sativa 15 thc one percent terps now this supposed to be name name brand you know what i'm saying so they better not have no [ __ ] [ __ ] in here don't do me like that sublime damn this one didn't even make a grim sublime didn't even make a grim do they claim it to be a ground but they just claim to be a pre-roll nope grain crack number two one gram pre-roll that did not even make a gram and it's not weed either you can tell when a bud has been broken down on this straight flower hell this got some extra in it what the [ __ ] is this what the [ __ ] the [ __ ] is that something blue well how the [ __ ] did they even pass the [ __ ] pesticide test and all that extra [ __ ] that's [ __ ] god plastic in it or rubber all right here we go we got a a three pack from okay bud only the best the best top shelf weed this is a three pack of strawberry amnesia all of their [ __ ] twos had one goddamn pre-roll and this [ __ ] both have three they claiming that this is the best top chef weed they didn't say [ __ ] trim you yeah well this [ __ ] ain't even three quarters of a gram you see what i'm saying but y'all pay attention man my [ __ ] telling you they using the best [ __ ] look at this [ __ ] this looks like some [ __ ] rabbit food i don't even know if i want that on my [ __ ] tray [ __ ] okay this right here is the off-hour premium pre-roll og kush flower of life and don't say no extra [ __ ] on it but let's just see what we got here just don't feel like trash at the end anyway i can tell it's a piece of bug yeah i'm smoking that [ __ ] right there in a [ __ ] blunt rap i'm gonna stop that [ __ ] in that tyson rap all right that's well over ground 115. so i think i might would go ahead and go with that right there i will be putting that in a [ __ ] rap actually i'm gonna put that in a regular rack because i don't want to risk it i don't want to taste every stuff got one last one now we got ruby mays bowl flour distillate and keep one gram pre-roll one gram is in this [ __ ] come the [ __ ] home that's it one gram period i told y'all y'all [ __ ] want the wrong guy man i will expose your [ __ ] bro this better be a [ __ ] grammar here i like that they put the distillation [ __ ] on the inside instead on our side see how about that m black [ __ ] i bust that open and that [ __ ] was straight trash hold the phone [Music] oh what is that [ __ ] purple weed in this [ __ ] damn damn [ __ ] purple eating that [ __ ] here this [ __ ] apart these last two might be where it's at man look at dude oh yes all there too 107. wait yeah so uh i ain't smoked it yet but i'm guessing the ruby maze and this one right here is probably going to be the best bed yup and then this one so if you're gonna cheapskate it go this route if we gonna spin a little bit go ahead and get these that's a guess now i ain't trying none of this [ __ ] i'm just going off what's real and what's fake this [ __ ] ain't even [ __ ] weed you know saying this dude right here might get by with this [ __ ] right here because you know what i'm saying like there's some buzz in there but he got a lot of trash that's what makes me think you know what i'm saying like he just got down to the bottom of his bloodstack because like [ __ ] who took their time putting that [ __ ] in there ain't none of these sticks ain't none of that [ __ ] they're gonna bust the [ __ ] ain't nothing in this one ain't nothing i'm saying that's top quality craftsmanship is what i'm trying to tell you guys you know what i'm saying like when someone cares this much about their product that's where i want to put my money at if they care about their product they care about your feedback they care about what you think about their product these [ __ ] over here look at this [ __ ] right here man this dude don't give a [ __ ] what you think about his [ __ ] look at that autumn [ __ ] sticks in there he don't get no these [ __ ] cleaned up nice that's real nice i don't even know what that [ __ ] is like i said that look like rabbit food right there but there it is folks there y'all have it if it was me that's what i do right there i'm about to put this [ __ ] in a wrap okay kush 7 10 man i'm out", "zihRmfShP1g": "what's good everybody jp here checking in live respect my region we've got a west coast meet tour pre-roll review joint effort we're outside elevating woodland hills check it out super dope bag today's pre-roll review is the fresh baked apple fritter super excited about this the homies work with fresh baked i've smoked their flour in the past i visited the circle in long beach i bought this numero numerous times it's always sweet gassy it's a beautiful pine um it's just a beautiful pine gassy creamy smoothie pungent robust herby weed man that's just fire we're looking at a one gram pre-rolled glass tube 25.95 thc 30.13 total cannabinoids is beautiful the color of the joint you can see the flower inside raw cone raw paper you can see chunks of purple and dark green some light green in there as well let's dive in one hit i'm gonna talk about it two hits score out of ten you guys know it's [ __ ] good let's get it okay packaging it's literally like 100 degrees out here and then chris is on the camera let's go let's go all right here we go here we go here we go you open the tube really really nice creamy smell god i'm excited here we go here we go it's not packed too tightly nice and it's not necessarily loose it's just not jammed in there dry pull is incredible it reminds me of like a cannabis sour wheat smell crossed with like tropical fruit all right light it up light it up light it up let it light it up all right all right here we go oh man first hit delicious it's got so much pungent gassiness and pininess that it's it's like you almost want to cough and then you start looking at the ash the ash because of the paper starts off dark but when we get through the second hit it's going to lighten up watch this just like i said got a little bit lighter there the flavor shines even more so on this i'm getting even more pine a tiny bit of citrus this musky pumaline and i'm getting obviously there's spiciness and this this this uh this cushiness to it as well the apple fritter well known to be super delicious yeah look at this ash right there it's coating up perfectly delicious when i start to think about a score out of 10 i've got a it's definitely a 9. i look at the packaging the only thing that i really see the packaging missing let me see where this packaging goes only see that i think that i see this packaging really missing is this window needs some terpene information i'm guessing on the terps and i want to be able to accurately describe it just based on what's here one gram tested in earth labs harvest date may 12 2020 packaged june 15th so this is oh this is three month old cannabis if it were pressure it'd be better i'm gonna give it a score of 9.5 is where i'm sitting the point five that's missing to take away from the perfect score is i want more information i want that terpenes on there i want to like obviously i'm impressed with the high thc it looks beautiful glass tube to high joint experience everything is good on the quality but give me more information about the genetics give me more information about the terpenes that are in here and mary jane's distro there's a phone number and then the packaging date the the harvest on this is three months old so we could do a little bit better there maybe it's elevate buying this maybe it's maybe it's the uh the fresh baked who knows 9.5 is a great score read the full review of respect my region we got a blog coming out soon description a little bit more details there on youtube make sure you guys subscribe really appreciate you guys fresh baked this is delicious oh yeah wonderful some joints get worse some joints get better this is one that's getting better appreciate you guys for all the love

bar com", "-neHaJr7bBI": "[Music] [Music] so [Music] you", "GAuf51yXruw": "Florida MJ 4:20 here and today I've got some free rolls from Liberty Health Sciences what have we got some Papa's herb purple inferno I've never had the purple inferno strain before I have had the grape inferno I'm not sure if they're the same strain they sound really similar so what I did was I looked them up and I'll tell you about that in a minute but this has a nine point eight percent THC so it's a very low THC batch it does say it's an indica dominant sometimes you know the end occurs get away with having a lower THC percentage even though you might expect it higher on less than point one percent of CBD nothing exciting there but I'll tell you a little bit more about the purple inferno the purple inferno strain here's the thing online it says purple inferno is a sativa dominant hybrid across between Jillybean and Hellfire strains spread by exclusive seeds but this says it's an indica dominant hybrid I think we have a labeling problem here or maybe a classification problem where we have grape inferno and purple inferno mixup at Liberty health I'm not sure but I did like the grape inferno it had pretty nice strong indica effects I was pleasantly surprised by that so let's open it up and see what it's like all right here we have it it's a nice nicely rolled one grand prix roll it is a little loose up here so what I would normally do is if you get a free roll that's a little bit loose just take it like this pinch the tip and you'll see this portal start getting longer I'm going to do it gently and just twist a little bit gently gently and what you've done is firmed up the entire joint if you need to firm it up down at the bottom just push it down like this a little bit why you're pulling up on the paper now it's really firmed up a lot and the smell on this let me see here doesn't have that much of a smell to it probably because it's already ground up and it's a pre-roll there's another one of the pretty rolls right here just one the tip is a little bit more loose than the other one all right let's get this sucker wait up see how much is in it it's on the edge between 1.2 and 1.3 grams so pretty sure we got a grand there of ground up cannabis that's good we got what we paid for all right so I think what I'll do is let a little bit out of here and we'll see just what we're working with see if we've got ground-up buds see if we've got shake bunch of leaves or anything like that or who knows what we'll find all right that's probably a good enough sample get that all back in there I'll have to pack this down a little bit and I'll take a look at what is in it now this is not as dank as the pre-roll of member berri I had if you check out that review you'll see that I mean the paper plate was just powdered with trichomes but that was like twice as much THC percentage is this this is 9.8 percent that's why I was only 8 bucks I mean the other pre-rolls I believe were $13 so you know almost getting to twice as much money when I bought these I purposely got the lowest price 1 that's what I wanted to see is you know what what kind of value is it so we got a little tiny leaf stem here nothing significant really and I see a lot of calyxes so this is Bud material that's all roundup you do see some you know little pieces of leaf material in there I don't see big stem pieces so it looks like this is a quality you know some quality stuff in there so I think what I'll do first is maybe vape some of it to give you an idea of the flavor you know like I said there's not much scent to it because it's already ground up it's already you know ready to go in a consumable format and that's gonna degrade the terpenes a bit so let me get this bowl packed the easy way a little bit of flavor when I inhale through it get this packed in there properly let it heat up for 10 seconds I'll go at it again now it should give me a decent hit and we'll see what it's like as you can see I'm getting a nice decent hit out of there nice amount of paper hope you can see that hit um it was a nice decent hit very very mellow smooth vapor it has like a celery seed flavor to it I've tasted that before from their blue dream but uh it's a decent flavor I like it's not you know one of your blow you out blow you're out of your chair fruit flavors or anything like that but it's a really nice pleasant babe didn't get much off of that hit probably cooled down too much while I was talking there we go I was a really good hit alright that's one of those hits that you can really feel definitely feeling it behind my eyes eyes are watering nose isn't running yet what my mouth is watering feels pretty good see if I can get some more vapor out of this very late who don't know seems to be this paper here there's like played an instrument really all right now I'm getting to the toastier flavor and I'm gonna finish this so you know from those pivots that I got I'm definitely feeling the effects it seems stronger than 9.8% so you know may make of that what you will it definitely isn't as as dank with trichomes as the the truly pre-rolls that I've had so how about I pack this back down a little bit so this stuff this these kind of card caps make an awesome packer for these pre rolls so it looks like they use raw papers maybe I'm not exactly sure on the brands I used to prefer raw but now I actually prefer on elements because the rice paper just leaves hardly any residue at all all right just got that bit off there I'm actually I'm I'm in need to go buy a lighter and actually I'm gonna need to go grab a lighter and I will be right back all right I am back with the all-important lighter and now let's talk it up you haven't seen me light one of these things before or seeing how they're lit the best way is to get them lit on the end before you inhale because if you inhale while you're holding the lighter on the end you'll suck the flame right in and it'll run really bad now this isn't going to prevent running but it just helps so there you go and as you can see my air conditioner is on full freaking blast and it is just blowing this flame like no tomorrow so it doesn't really want to light it very well but we'll get there in time so you see how the end is lit now there you go all righty the steadies up here show off that Liberty free roll swag you might get down won't even stand up so let's see smoke is pretty smooth it doesn't taste fruity or anything but it's got a decent flavor it doesn't taste like nasty disgusting smoke I've already got a pretty good head start with this right here but we'll see how far this one gets me so I'll show you the size of that it's not a very big bowl really small bowl and as you can see I didn't cash it all the way or vape it all the way it's still got a bunch of green around the edges so silly lighter over all the time on the job lay it down what the heck it's a smoking really well I know that first part of it up there I had repacked but you know the the grind is pretty decent on this it's pretty even it's not totally powder and there's not big chunks in it good Bryant I'd say I could taste a little bit more of the paper than I'm used to because of the wraps instead of the rice paper wraps but you know it's still a nice smoke burden really well really start to feel the effects now nice cozy feeling that makes sense so base lightheaded this really really relaxed very relaxing strain this makes me think this is the same thing as the great Biddeford oh I believe it seems like such a coincidence of that two strains are so closely named man Wow really really feeling it now starting to come in hot gonna be at the ED here look I'm ready you know I only had just a portion out a little bit I got the rest of that right there so not even a full grab joy trashcan I'll be right back you're not that smart home all righty let's get back to some tweets a broken my tweens baking today between where you ready baby heat or something something like that you know we really seem to bring out my personalities and all man getting really harsher towards the end all that resin builds up you know especially cone joints but it's also a lot more potent towards the end because of that oh well we know what are we gonna do relight it that's what we gotta do we've got to relight that thing we can't fall down on the job folks we got to get through this you know we can do that as a team as a team we could do that mm-hmm all right let's get this sucker rolling before lighter never wants to stand up for itself that poor lighter man oh man so definitely getting hard sure I've got a lot of pressure behind my eyes my eyes are watering like crazy and basically crying my nose is running I feel stoked how about that I feel great I feel well medicated so relaxed it just removes all the tension so decent very deep hmm so hard at the end they just hit so freely when you get how close to the end oh man then big ole hits yes big oh yes bar that's what you got them out summer didn't beat all oh gosh well that's it for me guys I mean that's the end so pop is a pre-roll one gram of purple inferno indica dominant hybrid they say although I found conflicting information online 9.8 percent THC less than 0.1% of CBD and it's got me toasty the most e so toasty to the most e is that a thing I don't know I just wanted to say thank you to the bud tenders they're at Liberty Health Sciences Panama City location because you guys are great you're always very helpful

please leave your comments on future videos like challenges or I don't know but I'm figuring out something I can do and then give a shout-out to someone and do a collab with them so I really can't think of anyone to do a collab with because all the people I know on YouTube they would just destroy me if I asked for a collab anyways yeah uh-oh it looks like my worry is so yeah you got this one Grand Prix roll joint of Baker Street and only thing to cut it off is this still sealed cut and now you push down on it and twist I don't simple as that 1 Grand Prix world joint I like these little containers of pre dough so what am i doing with this I am putting it in my bowl I just noticed that you can't really see it on camera but look it's look they twist the way up there and I just twisted it more so it looks like it's under a gram it's pretty amazing I'm re like almost four minutes in I don't even got a single viewer oh well can't win them all so let's do this come on favors there they could have easily put another couple points in there but I guess not hmm I don't like this well I don't mind this weed it's called Baker Street I'm not too fond of it but it was the closest thing I can find to a high THC count here we go that's a one grand pre-rolled empty so now I'm going to show you what I have on my tray that's what it looks like Baker Street 20% THC and it's an indica yeah all right I see rat so you can hit a ball it's not fully out yeah all right let's do this should I or shouldn't I oh well I'm gonna use this ball tonight go big or go home all right boys and girls I'm gonna show you what my bowl looks like nice and packed in there all right people let's do this alright ladies and gentlemen all I could say is please turn on post notifications just trying to reach my goal to 5,000 videos make sure to give this video thumbs up and yeah smoke responsibly don't do poppers because poppers will cause cancer honestly so smoke responsibly and let's hit this fat bone pit

smoker so I really don't know what else to say other than see you all later on this evening so peace out and I'll see you soon", "uUghLpRmCzs": "all right y'all today i'm going to be making a video on the la cush p rule the blue box edition so let's get to it alright just to start off i was doing some research and i think the pre-roll is og kush and abusive og i guess the genetics aren't really known but that's what they think it is also this drain is known to be testing at 27 thc so it's going to have a high thc content most of the time this one's testing at 26.87 thc it's going to be no cbd in this one package today is going to be 0.909 2020 so it's about 25 days later so so this is what the box is going to be looking like just a regular blue box it's a pretty cool box for a pre-roll though also my favorite packaging for the fuels are going to be the corroborate those come like in the glass box it's pretty cool this box didn't catch my eye at the dispensary though here's a closer look at the thc content and the cbd content and the packaging date opening you're going to want to open it from the top it's going to be sealed right here with some tape up here also so you just want to open that it's going to come in this ellie kush pre-roll cylinder box thing and then we're going to pop it open you're going to have this blue box la kush peru does not come in raw cone most paper should start coming to vibes that'll be pretty cool but i guess that's kind of [ __ ] up the the game right because nobody else is [ __ ] [ __ ] with big bird huh dry hitting it it tastes kind of weird learning a lot but let's see what it tastes like when i spark it up so i'm going to spark it up for you guys real quick all right i didn't want to have the flashlight anymore so i just turned the camera around but i'm going to spark the journal for you guys real quick i'll turn the camera again when i want to show you guys the ash so you guys can see how the ash is looking like because a lot of times the ash does not be looking good on pre-rolls to be black so let's see what this one's going to be looking like [Music] i'm not sure if i had this strand before i want to say i have [Music] but i think i've only had the card i'm not sure if i smoked the wheat i know the carter for sure smoke for cars of like i've had strawberry blondie i've had the blue box i think i've had the red box um i've had i've had jackpot i want to say i've had like maybe two more but i can't remember the names for the weed i've had the black gelato i've had i think the blue box um i've had [Music] i think i've also had the log now i want to see i also had one more for the week but [Music] this tastes like some gas and gas gas and gassy weed has a very pungent um taste to it i think that's the word i want to say pungent um i don't know it has like a very og taste to it it's very different from your like exotic strains this is going to be a straight kush so if you like kush it's going to be a stream for you guys if you guys want to get away from the gelatos and all the you know weird [ __ ] names the [ __ ] that they'd be making up nowadays ellie kush is a good company to go to when you want to get that straight og kush the straight gas taste i'm pretty surprised on how the ash is looking like it's actually pretty [ __ ] white there's a little bit of black you guys could see there but for the most part the ashland is going to be pretty white and that's good for pre-roll because most of the time they try to throw in the ends of this i did see one video when you look up ellie kush pre-rolls i did see one video of somebody opening it and it did look up a little bit like trim i'm not gonna lie but that's expected to be honest um i am surprised on how this ash was like i wasn't expecting that to be honest also i want to say i got this pre-roll for like fourteen dollars out the door so this is gonna go around the same price as a um alien labs pre-roll and i'm not gonna lie i'm pretty lit for how much i have left usually with the ending lapse people i'm not even this lit even though i'm not you know too faded pre-rolls don't usually get me faded because i know they throw in like the lower end [ __ ] it's not going to be straightened up it's not going to be like you know rolling up your own it's just never going to be the same also if it's like wax infused and [ __ ] then those are going to be some better pre-rolls like the high 90s piro or the jet imperials those are going to be some good periods but they're going to be a little bit more expensive what i like about these one ground pupils is that you're able to get um a taste of the top top top shelf eggs for a lower price pretty [ __ ] lit this is a pretty good pre-rule all right y'all i'm about to be done with this joint i'm not gonna lie i'm pretty [ __ ] lit right now this is for sure gonna be a heavy hitting indica um i could feel the high running down my body with this one just finished the drawing off i'm in the video right here y'all i definitely [ __ ] recommend this plural um i don't really recommend pre-rolls a lot but this period is hitting right here for sure um i will say this is hitting harder than the ellen laps bureau um i would recommend this apparel for sure you guys have not tried one if you guys haven't tried the um lake kush company in general i definitely recommend it i usually get the ace out here for like 36 dollars but let me know how much you guys get them for let me know how much you got to get these pre-rolls for i got that for i think fourteen dollars i wanna say definitely gonna need to try um the red box and the um log i've heard good about the lg but that's gonna be it for the video y'all hopefully y'all enjoyed the video hopefully y'all got lit with me hopefully i taught y'all something hopefully i'll learn something also i'm surprised to go get this and i'll catch you on the next one man peace okay bye", "Cm80bzheGlA": "hello folks and welcome back to the captains show I have of course your dedicated freedom-loving pot smoking libertarian host the captain himself I'm here with my buddy Zach he's gonna show you a brand spankin new tool that we got here and health for life dispensaries to make free rolls Zach how you doing buddy doing pretty good man how about yourself I'm doing well man so why don't you scribe to us what we have here so this is our future Ola knock box and basically what it does it allows us to make curry rolls at a faster rate than what we normally would we can get about 100 curry rolls for every two minutes from this one machine and it yeah it's nice excellent all right well let's see this thing rock that's the first thing I'm gonna do I'm gonna pull this little tray out from the bottom and that's essentially what keeps your flour in here until we need it to drop down so just place that down right there just give it a few couple taps at the top so you get everything knocked down everything down a little bit low that way we'll be lucky it will take care of the hard part for us all right and we're practicing full of ground-up flower yes Eric and each one's lined up with the tubes down on the bottom here yes they're all at the bottom those are all comb rolls right there filters already in there as you can see yes here everything's ready to go so what we're gonna do that right there we're gonna start on this we have to do it's because the way the chains run it's jumping up and down like this and it's flying out through the back like that alright so but it does this thing went up and down knocking these things down into a decent density for about two minutes and so what do we do now you're Zack so now what we're gonna do is run take this tray which is why we put the cover on because look at all that flour we would have lost had we Montera we're gonna put this back without both the Baltic so we'll leave that right there for the time being very cool and what we're gonna do is we're gonna put this on the back it's essentially our little kit so and we have magnets all wonderful right Oh oh nice held on there with magnets oh yes sir we're gonna very carefully take the top off that all right good hello let's take a look at this there you are folks these things are packed excellent with the knock box take a look at that perfectly packed cones this thing does wonders and then because sometimes it's and then one two three what whoa that is badass take a look at that folks one kind of so now when we go to you know put the finishing touches on them we don't even have to worry about them being out of out of this we could just pick them up one at a time very cool Zach thank you so much Randy it was a pleasure there you have it folks that knock box

little review on this strand of herbal realness here that I got at the dispensary earlier yesterday and I smoked it a couple times I'm basically going to just start doing reviews on like the different things that I used freedoms this is my first strand that I'm actually doing a review on it's probably not gonna be the most positive one haha either but I don't know it was like whatever this one is the super Silver Haze basically I think it's a sativa you see it's like similar to blue dream but I really like blue dream it's one of my favorite strands to actually use it like always helps me to feel really really good you know but um this one was kind of weird I I don't I don't know I I feel about it you know um I didn't really get a like really creative boost I did notice a lot of like like sometimes if I get a high kind of often whether it's a sativa and indica I get like a little bit of a shoulder like tense up kind of thing and I definitely got that from this I was working on a project it did help me like kind of gather some really cool images for a collage that I was doing so it you know I guess it helped me be like okay this is good this is good like I like this this looks good with that you know but both times I I you know I I smoked before I went to bed one night I woke up and I was like I felt like hungover from it the second time I did you know I did my artwork but again you know I woke up the next morning it kind of felt a little bit foggy you know which is not too unusual but it's you know for both times the side effects were kind of noticeable for me you know I don't ever say that like this will affect everyone in the same way you know we all have our different strands that we really like to use and whatever and that just you know work for us and yeah this one I don't think I'll really try this one again to be totally honest i i would always you know recommend anybody like if you like a nice sativa if you're if you're an artist or a creative all you know you can definitely use some blue dream and blue dream is a pretty awesome strand you know I've done some really really awesome artwork you know with that strand not playing I mean you know it's all inside here baby but yeah you know let's not give Blue Dream the cred but it definitely enhances your ability to just like you know go with the flow but I don't know what I can really say about this like any noticeable like what type of high it was you know I think you know it definitely took away nausea a little bit I did have nausea before I smoked yeah I don't know not really not really I like five star kind of kind of thing for me anyways so that's just a basic just a little short video talking about this bad boy here this is a pretty role you got I got it for like five bucks it was a pre-roll for five I have like the very little left in their bottom and in smoke no but it's cool you know one thing I like about getting pre-rolls is uh you know if you don't really have the budget for a big amount of Bud you know you can always just you know save some money dude and this you know you could smoke at least three times if you're not like a heavy you know smoker like that it's little tiny left will probably be like you know the third kind of time that I so anyways definitely not going to be doing that super Silver Haze anymore but I'll let you know when I find some like really awesome strands and I'm like really really digging but that one was that you know good opinions bad opinions like everything is a variety right like we can't like everything that we try so ultimately this one's not my cup of tea but maybe tomorrow's will be like a different story just saying alright guys let me know if you liked the video leave comments if you'd like don't if you don't want to you know that's cool to give some thumbs up you know follow me subscribe do all that stuff alright thanks for watching guys bang", "Rj8oxQBvz7I": "tada March 2017 volume number 14 exchange

EOG 23 point nine nine percent THC English breakfast cannabis tea got one of the satchels in there I was kind of looking at this one it is a smoking tip right here we have another another joint one grand prix rule humble its finest and it is let's see if I can find it fast eighteen point seven TC okay right here we have green goat sun-grown pure flower oil coffee Kush half brown the final joint in the box headband favorite because of the headband feel it gives you on your head because of a sativa properties and hemp derives CBD super berry jam from the jelly shamans earlier they had a champagne flavored jelly in one of the last boxes and I think it actually tells you how much maybe it's it's 40 milligrams of CBD that's awesome and last Satori dark chocolate 90 milligrams total so you have ten milligrams THC per serving with nine servings so this is great for people who do micro dosing so check it out if you don't know what micro dosing is", "-sD2C5_qbJA": "[Music] what's going on I want to give a shout out to organic CBD for making this review possible we have plenty to get into from this company but um welcome I'm sorry Cass if your first time to my channel welcome if you're coming back how you do it so they sent me over a pre-roll and this is their purple kool-aid I have never had this strain before they're using the raw do it I'm like smaller like herbs I mean yeah okay yeah it's CBD and it yeah but no it's smells like tea another exclusivity from our farm is the luscious purple kool-aid which originated from a rogue seed that smelled like a dream it's peachy citrusy tropical grape flavor is hard to describe but you just did but as uniqueness makes it one of our most beloved breeds follow the benefits of an explosion of terpenes this use DEA certified organic CBD flour will make your taste buds dance with happiness it's average six percent CBD will go excuse me we'll get you through the day happily it's belonging to the sativa family which makes it perfect which makes it perfect for daytime use it smells lovely dry wine that's the grape yeah I'm not getting a peachy citrusy I am getting the great because I gonna add something it first inhales like it's if I dry wine wine grapes yeah they're very dry yeah I know I don't like it's a dry taste it's peachy citrusy so the flavors hard to describe and the first in here I was like yeah tastes like you heard what I said you know but as you smoke it it's a dry taste you know it's burning slowly which is lovely like I said it's like a dry wine is that that's that tropical that's that briefly because it says peachy - citrus - tropical - great so that's the great bum you can tink I'm saying and I got to try a whiner I'm not a fan of it oh I had aftertaste Paul I don't like that you know I've experienced this is it dry started again to organic CBD yeah it gives me a dry you know again you do get I'm getting back grape flavor I do feel a change in my body a little bit of like a little pepper so there's a little bit of okay but I'm just not a fan of the taste and that's a problem it's effective it does what it says but I'm just not a fan of the taste yeah instead that dry tasted in is killing me well Wow but again Charlotte's organic CBD you might like this cuz I mean somebody the dry think may be fine for you it's not harsh it's just that try taste that that aftertaste mmm-hmm so this is something okay maybe I can start my morning but it's not something like I couldn't finish this in one sitting you know that's see that's even all like I get to good I can't take the dry taste after but you might like it anyway make sure you check out that pin comment so if you get some things from organic CVD they have a lots to offer so you definitely find something that you enjoy and we're gonna get into more from them until then I'm out thank you for checking out the review all information is down below where you can get the product for yourself

it was like nine at night we were just walking back to me just seen it we could do that wait what do you mean we could do that this pretty boat is done well this was a smoke sesh pretty [ __ ] with it good stories oh yeah my own business and i had just got you", "QsEwAlvkc-0": "I'm over here with braden here from Rocketbox let me go ahead and show you their booths right here, they are a company that does equipment for pre-rolls and with our groovy doobies we are looking right now to find a more efficient way that we can make more cannabis joints to be able to lower our price down to the retailer as well as to the consumer so I'm going to go ahead and let Braden talk a little bit about this machine what the value is and why we're doing it it's all yours thanks brad, yeah I'm Braden this is the bottom tray of the Rocketbox essentially we're gonna do here is drop in your cone that you use for the joints after that, what you do is take some funnels here in this top tray go ahead and secure that on top and you pull these trays go ahead and put them in the machine so basically we're taking the cones and we're taking the cannabis when did we start loading the cannabis into the cones is that done over here on that side that is done when the machine is running so you've got the machine here it's loading up on fresh air underneath as you can see by the number here once that hit 60 a little bit of vibration here to turn that on so now you're looking at a little bit of how the rocketbox packs the joints by vibrating the whole tray make sure you get a nice even fill throughout the entire join as you spread your material on top during the vibration this bottom tray that'll be holding your cones they kind of see a couple of the cones peaking up on the bottom there that I dropped and those come in different sizes that are volumetrically engineered to make sure that you don't overfill you know basically using the average density of flour there and the other part is with his top tray out what you'll see these funnels also act as a limiter make sure that once or flowers in there it doesn't get overfilled and you can't smoke the joint afterward it gets you know too crowded does this have the ability to do, say quarter size cones like half gram, gram joints we recommend different papers for that so essentially you use the same paper or same size cone, but what you do is you have a longer filter that filter is going to take up more space less room for the flower but since they are volumetrically it does focus on the space for the flower but if the space in the cone is taken up by the filter you don't really have to worry too much about you know flower getting into it so when you are looking at the different-sized cones a one-gram cone it's going to be much larger than a quarter gram cone so you're absolutely so you're saying basically you're not going to lose any flower outside of a quarter gram versus a gram with the cups that you have here yeah so the trays are all compatible with one another so the bottom tray holding the cone that's what's gonna change sizes the top tray would be compatible with any of them how many joints does it produce and the time frame talk a little bit about that absolutely so what you're looking at with this tray here 453 joints so if you're doing one gram\njoints you are gonna use one pound of flour for one run 1/2 gram 1/2 pound of course and the other part is it takes about three minutes for the machine cycle you'll need time for your team to close the joints afterward of course but in terms of cycle about three minutes and you'll have them all packed up they'll ready to be you know closed out with one machine you can do up to 25,000 joints and the course of an eight-hour shift okay so the other question that I would have is based on the ground or the courses of how they're grinding of the cannabis itself does your machine change I know you can change like the vibration speed is there a way that you can change the density of how much it's packing down into the cannabis joint or is that something that has to be done with a tool to be able to you know push down the cannabis yeah so a lot of that is going to depend on your flower but beyond that you can customize the machine cycle and make it shorter so that it's not packing in for as long it's not gonna get quite as dense there are a couple others you know a little tips and tricks you can do but what it really comes down to is that with the machine you get a full day of on-site training so our expert comes out to your facility and we're gonna take a look at you know every little part of it from post grind your moisture level you know the papers using out all the above can give you every little tip and trick we picked up hundreds of clients to make sure that you know exactly and to make the exact choice that you want", "be7m72NBJ6M": "hey I'm sorry kids and welcome back to star cash games oh but wait we're

Facebook it's plain Jane hemp they're a company a hemp company focused on making the smoothest cleanest most odorless hemp products on the market our hemp rolls are designed to be an alternative to tobacco allowing them to be sold and consumed everywhere that cigarettes are currently our goal as a company is to always provide the best products at the most reasonable prices we do this by providing you everything you need quality products without the things you don't we support small farmers we only saw a flower from local family-owned farms providing you with the flower of the highest quality what's going on once again shout out to Plain Jane again try play Jane on social media networks but send me over there hemp products they're hemp rebels to sample and you know I've been doing some reviews for other companies and you know it's good to have something to compare you know than just trying a product first time you're trying something in oh my god it's the best thing since sliced bread alright so when I first opened it up I was like wow these look like cigarettes but then when I read their mission statement I said okay I understand but it could go to waste because I mean you want people to get off the idea of smoking cigarettes but I mean it looks like a cigarette but I actually understand you can't have a prio looking like a joint and to be sold in stores so I get the whole process so mean yeah now the first one I tried was to odorless smoothest cleanest and it hasn't odor it's not really like - you know him that I've had before the amount of CVD in each of them let's see if you can see it where is it okay there we go all right uh-oh it works so we're looking okay so look into the total CVD and you can see it for yourself you need to do if you have to rewind it back and do something yeah and go through all that now I tried to overlay smoothest I don't like the taste of either of them I don't know it's just I don't know if it's tough filter part that's doing it but I don't like it is it effective it is common not as strong as other hemp products that I've tried is the first time I mean pre-roll is just the setup data team but from other hemp that I've tried and again you have different grades and stuff so I know it's gonna affect you differently but I'm just talking about from these for me I felt it but it wasn't as again I like the whole idea that CBD for me caused me this one okay now for me it's not a product that I would like if I saw this in a store I would think I mean of course why I have to read it I mean a small print yeah it says because it doesn't say it says hemp in small print there so like just passing by a person passing vines you know because they have a pack of the full pack and it looks like a pack of cigarettes you wouldn't think it's a hemp product so I mean they're they're selling method I get it but I mean it can it's like a pro and a con so to speak now for someone who's trying to get off cigarettes and trying to move into the more healthier I would definitely say give it a try well for me again someone that I mean I didn't come from smoking but I do enjoy hemp products and I don't so much want my what I'm using to look like a cigarette because yeah I don't smoke so that's just me s it's a a visual thing but a product is effective it is calming not as potent as others I've tried then I try to smooth this the cleanest earlier smoothest and clean it so thick oh I meant to say the only smooth the odorless one it burns really quick I notice Dave burns real quick I'm gonna try like [ __ ] [ __ ] real quick I didn't find it the same with this art and I like that they have the coats on the back so that if you want to get all the information download an app on your phone that you can read and scan you can scan and get the information for yourself I like that so you know everything that you're inhaling in your body so the pros of this is great get off smoking cigarettes to a healthier life and and great results to your body the and the only con for me my experience I don't again I don't know if it's the filter but I don't like the taste of it in my mouth think it's the filter so I'm thinking it open it up and just smoke the hip yeah but um yeah shut up begin to plain-jane from making this review possible allowing me to try your product again hit me up on my Instagram or all you have to do is just google the title and you will find their product they also carry but as well in stuffs not just pre-rolls this is just one of the products that they carry and yeah oh no [Music]", "_EJKFd2AZNo": "all right what's up everybody this is main homie any opinions bring yet another episode we're just gonna try out this CBD hemp pre-roll we want to do a huge shout out to my home is over at Stone Age pharmacy in Long Beach right down Long Beach Boulevard by the 405 and I think were low but the reason why I went in there was to get clones which I you know I'll put in the video I walked in there and one of the bud tenders like hey man you know we connected before so he's like here try this pre-roll and so that's what I'm doing so shout out to them for you to all really hooking it up and honestly sponsoring this episode so yeah it says here that this is a full CBD hemp pre-roll which I think the rap itself may also be a pre robot pretty raw in this Bureau but it also may be hemp it says on here from the code to the CBD hemp flour and we'll let that helicopter pass real quick that's what happens or you live in a very populated area honestly dude what is this you know what what's up with this whole little comb finish I think it would have been better they just stuffed it and left it you know what I mean or cut it or you know do a little flat but this is this is not wrong other than the fact that it's unpleasant to like pull out to be like what the [ __ ] you know what I mean it's just it's not finished you gotta have a good finish but because I did they just hand it to me they put it away I don't know exactly how much these costs but I'll figure it out but yeah man it's [ __ ] cold out here you know what I mean so I'm all stuffy anyways before she gets real we're here let's let's light this let's spark this up now finally so the rapper itself is smooth what comes to mind with these is kind of somewhat the equivalent to cigarettes because CBD is it is like yeah it's gonna probably make your body feel good but it's not gonna get you high so and it's also in my opinion probably wave cheaper to produce but here's the thing with these we don't know it says lab tested but we don't know what's in this but I don't have an numbers so I feel that they're trying to kind of weed into the to the industry especially with the CBD crazy everybody's into see we need goods it's honestly really it tastes good it's a good smoke kind of tickles tickles the top of your your throat a little bit when you inhale now obviously with no seat would no oh you see that smoke we obviously with no THC you're not gonna get faded but what I do want to see from the CBD is how does it affect me or if it's just there if it's just another pre-roll to smoke you know because honestly it's not that bad especially if you're not trying to be higher I know some friends would love to get super faded but then you know after a while they're like dude I need to come down I feel like this is gonna definitely calm you down just because you're smoking you know that habit of the vid Haley kind of relaxing and like you know what smoking kind of does to is you know you breathe and relax honestly it's not a bad it's not bad at all I think this is really is is a nice nice pre-roll I just wish there was more numbers but you know what it's not it's not a weed product in my opinion it's a CVD pre-roll just like a little cigarette oh that's just for fun you know our friend just chilling out it's not like let's go get high it's not that but yeah it does taste good the smoke is smooth a little harsh I mean just a little bit harsh I don't know that's because of the actual blunt itself like you could taste a little bit of grape I want to say but it's just so harsh and that's another thing with the CBD I wish I could see how they grow it or what they do what they put in it is there any pesticides is it come from a big ass far or is a just a little mom-and-pop shop a little family farm or is it indoor/outdoor there's so many question because the CBD technically you could I guess take this any state it's not illegal you know what I mean I really think this is a filler for cigarettes if you're trying to get off cigarettes I try to get it to weed I feel like this would get you there because you're not getting high you just having a smoke field which is East a zone you're not I mean this is not bad I honestly feel really calm and relaxed Pam Parillo so it says Hamm Parillo Wow honestly I would I would say you guys gotta try this I'll put the price of the description below once I figure out how much it cost me just smoking this and try this now I think this was a pleasant experience definitely not what I would go to every single time I'd prefer TCU mom my bud but definitely worth just trying out do I see this staying yeah I definitely think that there's gonna be some people out there that are just gonna buy these just just just to have them you know just to go somewhere chill out because honestly you are relaxed and I think that's got a the goal the CBD has tried I don't know if it's real or not but definitely it does have a calming effect wiping my nose it's so cold out here alright guys I mean that's all I got to say about this and anymore would just be [ __ ] so I'm gonna end it there and if you guys want to like share and subscribe I appreciate that I am growing more bud and I'm doing that a little bit better than I've always done just trying to up the level so if you guys want to see a grow log or just you want me to post some growth videos let me know other than that yeah I'm out", "z3dbbY0G0Pg": "[Music] hey hey thanks for stopping by again today today we're talking about Duchy from Hanna mitts this is a peck of their

not like school and I gotta catch it it burns nice to eat me a slow and I like that very much again shoutout fern Valley links down below guys check them out check them out", "8jI777TvQWI": "oh all right what's up what's up ladies and gentlemen welcome to my youtube channel and if you're new to my youtube channel welcome and make sure to turn on post notifications and the reason why I say that it's because I upload constantly not daily constantly which means just trying to reach my goal to 5,000 YouTube videos that's right 5,000 and only you the viewer can help me reach my goal to 10,000 subscribers so with that being said let's get this video happening alright so I've got a 1 gram pre-roll joint here of radar Kush so if you're new to my channel you're probably wondering what I'm gonna do with this well I don't smoke joints so I'm opening it up I'm gonna put this weed in my bone so yeah that's what I do I hit bong hits also I start my video off with a cigarette because I do smoke cigarettes and I am addicted to cigarettes so just bear with me I don't usually smoke my full cigarette I usually smoke most of it and then I put it out I'll empty there is an awesome Oakland bong rip so I really don't know what else to say other than ah it's a good afternoon today in Sudbury it's not raining or anything it's a nice day today I guess I never been out there today but I'm definitely taking that up opportunity to go outside today but as a right now just just holding on to this for a second or two because this is what I got to do take a baseball bat oh yeah it's also $12 a gram for this stuff Oh dollars a gram it's so funny that they couldn't even fill it up that's the funny thing you could probably fit an actor like point two in there ah - I didn't bring liquids damn it I should go grab some liquids right now just to make it better for me also I'm gonna put out my cigarette so you can get a drink and that's about it she's out all right go get a drink I'll be right back all right I got some Fruitopia ah I still got one viewer all right so let's start this is what I gotta do what I gotta do alright I'm see it on my tray all right this is my grandma Rayder cush all right people let's smoke a bowl but first first things first I like my cigarette back up put that aside some Raider hush with this weed all I can smell is Windex people actually it smells like mr. clean it's like it smells like like one of those floor cleaners like mr. clean in that general sense or will wind axe and mr. clean mixed together that's exactly what this weed smells like but it's good stuff well we got a viewer and no one is saying anything or commenting I do like to have a conversation with people but not if they just sit there or whoever they are well almost 10 minutes into this video ten minutes so I got a bong hit pact of raid or cush and yeah it's very good stuff it does smell like mr. clean and Windex but it's good stuff I don't want to say I just hate talking to myself when I have people watching people should have a conversation it's kind of odd that I have over 1,700 subs and you did not respond to my how oh okay how's your day going all my days going good so far yeah I was like out there when you said that comment so yeah my day is going good my day is awesome because I got something that's an herb the day goes well when you have herb you don't have it's a boring day so as for myself probably after I'm done doing this video I'm probably going to get back to my show on Netflix and that would be stranger things season 3 episode 3 it's kind of crappy there's only eight episodes this season of stranger things anyways I am done my smoke that's good but I'm on the tolerance break so I'll get very bored hmm I don't know a tolerance break I should take a break one day but I can't because every time I do even if I go through days without getting high and if I do get high after those three days oh my god I I don't know how to explain it it's just I feel like I'm going to go to jail for a very long time for some reason there's always a reason for something but yeah I feel like if I quit and if I smoke I feel like the whole world's after me for your thumbs up show some support and yeah let's do this let's get high one minute first ball hit of the day holy [ __ ] right now I'm just try not to puke holy crap man holy [ __ ] oh yeah holy cow 27 percent THC people that's unreal I don't know what to say man I really don't know what to say [ __ ] oh why do I buy pre-rolled joints and don't smoke them it's because I don't smoke joints I'm sorry about that maybe if it was someone else's and they lit it I would have no choice to smoke it that's why I don't smoke joints because I I can't smoke them but I just don't then why do you buy the joints it's because when you don't have like extra money to buy like containers like this because they normally don't sell like grams of things I want but I was actually really really surprised when they said they had Rader cush in grams because I always wanted to try Rader Kush and I liked it I like this stuff for $12 a gram it's better I like it but some pre-rolled joints like bubba kush you only get 2.5 joints basically you buy one gram for $26 and then they have other kinds of pre-rolled joints some you can buy like five gram 5 1 gram pre-rolled joints for like I think it's like $59 or something like that and there's the others yeah other than just buying containers like this because normally half quarters of like good stuff range between $36 to $43 1/2 quarter so basically buying the pre-rolled joints is much better in a way but I'm pretty happy about this honestly yeah the Raider could really happy when I saw this I had 12 dollars a gram so yeah when I get extra money I'm definitely going back to this if they still have it because it's a high high THC count at 27 percent that's serious fun fun well I think I'm gonna end this video already 23 minutes in it's a pretty good video today just gotta say thank you for all the people that decide to stop in and say hello yeah like I said I don't upload daily I upload constantly I could upload probably two hours from now but yeah just trying to reach my goal to 5,000 videos I know I'm like about I said someone told me that their day they're like Jay you just have like two thousand and a hundred videos to go I'm like really I'm like I didn't reach tooth out mm videos yet or wait 3000 videos yeah someone told me they're like you almost have 3,000 videos I'm like yeah I have like 2900 that was my response damn I don't know to say I'm really really stoned right now I'm probably just ranted about whatever but yeah I'm getting back to my show on Netflix which is stranger things season 3 episode 3 if you haven't seen stranger things yet I advise you to go check it out and if it's not your thing that you would like to watch I still advise you to go check out the flash now that's a good show to watch I forget what season got me seriously emotional but it's a good show honestly yeah it's a good show there's a lot of good shows on Netflix I should actually put a link in the description next time yeah but anyways yeah that's the 25-minute mark oh joy ah anyways yeah smoke responsibly yeah I see him Lucifer I'm not into something like that that's just that's not my thing so yeah I'm probably gonna end this livestream got uh got back to my show I'm probably not young I don't know there's so much I just want to watch but I'm only one person right so yeah thanks for checking out my livestream today everyone if you made it this far into the video make sure that turn on post notifications give this video a big green thumbs up just show some support and yeah I'll be back sooner

man I have another review coming from I think I told you guys this in my last review that I was going to be reviewing this because I got two things and it was from family wellness I got the New York diesel and then I have these indica blend pre-rolls indica blend pre rose oh oh the indica Bream blend pre-rolls are coming in at 14.4% CBD they are wind grandma peace first of all every package from fab relief if you saw me open the last thing comes with the notice to law enforcement which I am a huge fan of I want that if you don't have this in your back it automatically takes you down a notch to me and of course the COAS they come in every package know the indica blend I reached out I got a little information about them the indica plan is Afghan hash is F the Afghan strain bubba kush strain and purple rain I've done a review on all of these strains individually if you would like to know what I think about them if you don't want to go back and watch I'll just tell you I love the Afghan it is a heavy heavy indica it is very tasty it's strong and it makes you sleepy Bubba cush was my favourite strain of 2019 believe me and I'm a sativa guy but it's an indica but it's more like an indica hybrid I think because it didn't really have any stuff I could smoke bubble and still take care of things that I needed to do for that day and then the purple rain I love purple rain it is a beautiful in a very very tasty flower and on a day like today I need pre rose I'm gonna tell you why I just got work soon as I got off work I came to the house I took a shower fresh out the shower I

gonna give them about Derrick solid eight and a half easy eight and a half nine only because I like my pre-roll just a little bit looser it was it's packed tight and full which I really love but I did have to freak it a little bit so that made me take a little half a point because there would be a nine there would be a nine but I got to break it down to eight and a half just because I had to freak it a little bit but as far as the taste the taste alone is a nine the way it tastes is a nine it tasted great this is a great blend and now it is pulling and see when it cools like that when that flows like that you really get to tasted that the tasters are nine easy that Afghan and that bubble in that Purple Rain go great together it is a great blend definitely it must have hmm sharing is

"McyyS1F183k": "hey guys what's up welcome to my channel welcome back to my channel today I'm going to be doing a review on this CBD pre-roll joint vegan on my name's Robin change get you changed big buddy range no we're not the same I found my local smoke shop so some people ask me can I get it CBD without ordering it online like how can I just go pick it up smoke it today you know spark in them you can pretty much pick and pick it up anywhere I've seen it at gas stations I've seen I've seen it at smoke shops like dispensaries you name it CBD is pretty much everywhere they even have CBD stores in different places when I first seen it I thought it was just one pre-roll like I couldn't see what it says but guess what it is - because secret nature is what the packaging looks like I think it is so freakin cute it's called frosted cush and it is to see your city rose to free Rose that our CBD and it says in the comment you suck you how they think how they say later on there and at the bottom it says organic cannabis flower so we got to see what secret nature's all about I've never tried them before or anything they actually are from Rogue Valley Oregon hmm so if I ever go to Oregon if I like I might have to go and check this out but this is what it looks like and then it just has a little tube this is so cute like you can keep your ashes in here if you want you can keep your yeah joints whatever you smoke but it is to pre-rolls in I swear this stuff smells so freakin good this is what they look like what the tips look like I know you guys did it I hope you guys can see I'm glad you like the beauty gurus but yeah this is what the tips look like you can see like get some cbdu at the tip I don't see any like sticks or anything actually there is a little stick right

lattice be laughed at it even got the test ID I got it done and Bill Costa labs I don't know what the where that is but they basically tested it and they even have a test ID on the bottom of the package so this is how you know you can some legit smoke okay y'all don't want to be smoking their trash yes you can get trash as cb2 flouring the way this whole he it's so hard I taste I can't really

then everything just popped up that's really high that's really how you got to do it anyway like in order to find what you really want and check out new people in trying to shake you just gotta try shape but make sure it is the lab tested okay even if there's not and you just want to try it give it a try because I still do the [ __ ] but I try to make sure that I do see lab tested somewhere on

for a couple months now these are all the old containers I have what I like about these CD joints is a you had to keep that body hive that you get from smoking THC products but you also keep a mental clarity so you can really think and you're not as foggy I guess is the best way I could put it my favorite thing about this product is the packaging the packaging is just so premium it can be reusable that's why I kept all my cases because you can fit your pre rolls or joints in there that you made yourself and just use s container it has a magnetic flap so it won't open random little matchbox addition to it is a very handy just in case you forget a lighter but overall other than the price it's a very good product and I would definitely recommend anyone that would like to try any CBD drones and also get a cool package", "Q_RKmbYjq2M": "hello everyone good morning good morning good morning this is your homie malty oh we and today we're coming with so i come off with my car my cat is there um that is only me now people today we have the nice and the cbd uh products that and last night we done the from the goods and today we have from the goods as well onion the last night was more um concentrate site uh you know a beautiful and uh grounded purple uh shuttle it's really good um and of course ours and the little um a little vape pen uh what it's delicious as well this is blue dreams that if someone is interesting on that side um check my last video um or go on the straightaway to plays with cbd products people today we're going a little different way we go help our way and as well i wanted to discuss what i think about company how i see in the website and all that you know by the way i'm not sponsored by this company all this product was by them by from my pocket that i'm not related this is pure pure pure pure my review and my opinion with no you know influence from another people uh people say that today we'll be having the disability uh little pineapple express pereirol uh 30 percent of cbd or 14 protein of cbd that people what i do i change our view um i do little close-ups that you can see in the bible how it happens and we open this and later yeah you know i light up and smoke and i tell you my faults what i think it's good or not it's i think have little different approach uh this company for anyway if you change the view up here you go people pineapple experts coming out to but anyway um first i really like um how you know a company really make packages uh it's look amazing i like it it's really in the top top quality uh at least in the packaging and i'm not saying that there is bad boys it's under five star um now with this one it's in the 14 percent of cbd okay that is that is cool and now ingredients why i say this company have literally different approach look at that people organic pro property theory i'm sorry if i butch this world herbal blend what i think it's really don't use hemp it's use this and blendy use this on the use this blendy blendy blendy blendy products you know [Music] what you can use to um to mix with your normal and the wheat what is quite cool i try and it's quite nice um i try this in the holland anyway go back to this little bad boy and what has happened and the art and the cbd isolate what is in the from help and the tapes and minor cannabinoids that can include in the cbg and cbc um that and a lot with previous and products that people yeah quite interesting but let me open this it's safety card we like that let me smell this bubble what's this inside kind of sweet and tiny that really shoot exactly and smell and here we go and that is cool this this is glass it's glass people this is good it's glass tube that that is big shout out um no plastic you know cool nice glass tube uh that people yeah look i was saying they look nice i will if so use and the own papers what we have as well and at some point i'll be delivery of these bad boys uh don't you order it those people yeah this look nice smell quite okay not anyway we got we changed our view and i light up this bad boy but we here you go we go it's time to try this little bad boy uh people uh coffee is check uh lighter check and of course our spiritual check yep that here we go ready to go people i smell very piney and heavy piney what is correct because and the pineapple excess should have little tiny sweet piney healthy flavor however we see how gold is it's quite moist very mellow it smell the pine on you not every day you take kind of sweetness almost nothing almost go tasteless and i think if i'm honest i like these blends for you on the sleeves instead to use tobacco because it's almost tasteless and you have your whole almost whole spectrum and the real deal stuff now i don't say it's bad because it's not however to compare to two flavors what you have from this uh flavors what you have from that uh yeah this little lay down however you know it's nice ben honestly it's good quality and the herbal mix that uh you know it's how it is and i tell you that we go um it's more it exactly taste better than ham flour that i think i like this approach i like this approach to use herbal mix and infuse with with cbd isolates well that is done um i think it's better idea to do it and instead to have perroll hem however i think price of this is about 10 pounds it's 9.99 um it's a little too much i know and they give me and the nice and the glass you know jar and that that it's all cool and that i think it's a little too much uh it's only that my opinion um if i much prefer add you know another tenor and have this bad boy and i have 300 parts and it i i must be picky i'm sorry um overall it's no battery it's very mellow almost you smell it tastes nothing that as the art medicine for you yeah i think in the cook yeah it's not unpleasant what sometimes can have unpleasant than the smell that it's it's okay i mean i think it's still uh it's still um little down compared to these products that people anyway i still be smoking this and now i'll be quickly jumping to show you in the website how look um that you can see um and decide for yourself now people change the quick review and i show your website and we'll be done now people check there you go people website it's let me underscroll it's really uh look nice i like how look look uh cool now you have quality control the premium and the line of cbd infused products and the lab tested that it's so good you know explain you everything nicely a winner so 2020 i'm not surprised um that people yes i think it's this is the herbal mix uh and it's done that i if i'm honest it's better by this uh it's better by honestly by this you you come better and that now you have a vape pants what i really like and enjoy um of

some point in the review uh that people thank you very much hopefully you like and enjoy in this video if you guys don't forgot like share subscribe uh if you're new here and see you next time people have a great day", "Cf7fcJVHRLU": "hello everyone today I'm going to show you our custom cone and custom tube selection some various branding options and a few different tip and filter options so first I'm gonna start with our standard rolling paper options our standard rolling papers are all sourced from France they are ultra thin French rolling papers made from the factory that has been producing rolling papers for over 200 years it is FSC certified pulp which means it is sustainably sourced the rolling paper itself is made to food grade standards as required by the FDA and EU so that means this is paper that is produced to the same standards that is required for any type of paper that comes in contact with food so the three paper type options we offer in our standard rolling papers is unrefined brown refined white and 100% hemp there are four standard sizes that are rolling paper cones come in that is the 84 millimetre cone the 98 slim cone the 98 millimetre standard and the 109 millimetre come the 84 millimetre cone holds 0.5 grams the 98 slim holds also 0.5 grams but is a slimmer and longer profile the 98 millimetre standard holds 0.75 grams and the 109 millimeter bolts one gram that's commonly known as the king-size cone all of our standard rolling paper cones feature a 26 millimeter crutch and a straight gun line the straight gun line helps to reduce uneven burning and also reduces the amount of paper that your customer has to smoke therefore improving the smoking quality of your joint all of the cones are produced in an ISO 9001 certified facility and lastly are compatible with all filling besides the standard sized rolling paper cones we can also produce some extra large sizes such as this 120 millimeter by 26 millimeter cone or this 140 by 30 millimeter cone both of these cones will hold more than one gram which is increasing in popularity recently as producing joints that hold between 1.5 and 3 grams so we do offer those special sizes as well so now moving on to the branding options for those standard rolling paper cones the most common way that our clients will brand the standard rolling paper cones is via direct printing on the filter tip so that what that means is we print directly onto the filter paper and then we roll that into the cone that's important to note because there will be some dilution of the colors as the rolling paper is going over the printed filter tip so for instance the hemp paper has the lowest transparency it is the most opaque so it will work best with designs that are light colors against dark colors or dark colors against light colors the white paper is the most transparent so you'll get the truest colors and the most original colors what some of our clients do in order to get closer to the original color since the color is diluted by the rolling paper being rolled over it they'll they'll modify their colors slightly in order to get to the more true original color of their brand and so one easy way to do this is to take your design print it out in a few different shades of your preferred colors and then then just place a rolling paper over that design in order to see how that rolling paper then dilutes the colors of the bread the brown rolling paper is going to be sort of in between the hemp and the white in terms of transparency so there's no specific guidelines around that to design your your logo with we print by a four color offset process and so what that is is we print in CMYK you can print full-color via this process but it is a very high quality print it is using plates and directly laying the design onto the filter tip versus something like a digital printer so this will produce very high quality branding very high quality prints in the printing industry it is considered the highest quality print and then moving on beyond the direct printing we have two additional paper types beyond the rolling paper types we have our hemp wrap blunt papers as well as our palm leaf blunt papers both of these cones will produce a smoke that is thicker and richer as compared to the regular rolling paper cones and so that's why we call these the blunt cones as they produce a smoking experience that is much more similar to a blunt as a port as opposed to a joint this is a great way to expand your pre-roll line with some new product offerings there are certain customers in the dispensary who prefer this type of smoke as opposed to these regular rolling papers and then moving on for some new branding options we have the external wrap in the cigar band the external wrap and cigar band are the only ways that you can brand the palm leaf and the hemp wrap blunt cones but you can use them as well on the regular rolling papers if you would like the reason we can't do the direct printing with the butt Blunk owns is because as these are not transparent papers you won't be able to see through the paper and see the original filter tip that's why we have to put the design over the paper as opposed to under the paper so with the full external wrap that's basically a sticker wrapping around the entire crotch area with a full color print there's absolutely no dilution of your colors or your branding so you get the true original colors with no need to modify the logo at all as you can see we have regular glossy type printing as well as some more like foil type and then we also have the cigar bands which is going to be a die-cut shape that you can put you could put a circle you could put a diamond you could really customize this to any type of shape that you would like and then moving on beyond these various types of external reps and cigar bands we have our tube style rolls and so the truth style is a little different to the cones obviously as it is straight rather than cone-shaped and so it is a little bit more difficult to fill versus the cone the cone works in most you know standard filling operations with the tube you're gonna either have to hand fill or use some slight modifications to your filling machines in order to fill these tubes so we have several different types of tubes and I'm gonna start first with the cigarette style tubes the cigarette style tubes are you know what are used in the tobacco industry to produce cigarettes and so these are either gonna have full cellulose acetate filter they are slightly different as compared to a regular cigarette the filter that is used in these is called a high flow filter so it allows much more smoke and material through as compared to a cigarette actual cigarette filter and so these will filter out a lot less THC they will still filter out some but it does help to like cool and make the smoke much smoother as compared to just having a paper filter if you don't want any type of filtration there is also the option of having a hollow tip filter so what that is is a it just just cut with a hole right down the center so there's absolutely no filtration with the cigarette style tubes there are three paper options there's unbleached hemp bleached hemp and just natural flax paper so those are the three options with the cigarette style tubes and then moving on beyond the cigarette style tubes we have the artisan style tubes the artisan style tubes use a thinner rolling paper as compared to more like cigarette style paper which is going to be slightly thicker the artisan style tubes come standard with a spiral tip filter these this spiral tip filter really helps to cool down the smoke and prevent any types of Scooby Snacks or little particles coming into your mouth this this standard style artisan tube is 84 millimeters long with an 8 millimeter diameter at the top so that's the same as the standard cigarette style tube size this will generally fit about half a gram of material we also have some more specialty style tubes these are to blend style tubes one with the hemp wrap and one with the palm leaf the palm leaf has a standard 8 millimeter top opening and is an 84 millimeters in length the hemp wrap style tube actually has a 11 millimeter top diameter and is a hundred and nine millimeters in length so that's gonna hold a little bit more material as compared to the shorter and skinnier ones and then moving beyond that even we go back to our cones we have a couple different filter types here and all these filter types could be put into tubes or they could put into cones and even if I show it just as rolling paper it could be put into the hemp wrap or it could be put into the palm leaf so with this first filter tip customization I have a long 30 millimeter tip and also a shorter 21 millimeter tip we can make any tip length any tip diameter so these are just two common examples that people will use a lot of people like the 21 millimeter crutch for something a little bit shorter and a lot of people like the 30 millimeter crutch for something a little bit longer next to this I have the biofilter tips the bio cooling tips they're similar to the cellulose acetate filter tips however they are biodegradable they have the same function however they will filter out the tiny amount but a lot less than a regular filter and they will help to cool down the smoke and improve the smoking experience exponentially and then last I have two very premium options we have the glass tip and the wood tip filters the glass tip and what tip filters help to create a nice tactile experience as well as really elevating the cone beyond just a regular joint into something a little bit more premium now that we've gone over some of the basic customization options that we offer for pre-rolled cones and tubes although we are adding new selection almost every week here at custom cones USA let me just talk about a few of the logistics of starting a custom branded cone or two project so first with any of the branded options I showed you the direct printing the external wrap or the cigar band the lead

and the packaging here in this video now i have tried a couple times to film this video kind of unsuccessfully what's up you guys it's king kali here for another mini vlog even though i don't know what order of my vlogs are coming in on which is why i'm gonna sound so excited in these vlogs compared to my little review videos where i sound just kind of dead sometimes but anyway we're gonna fix that we're doing it on the go vlog today yeah so i'm just saying this isn't gonna be the main video you guys this will be inserted in the video just like another vlog that i have coming up um but i have a lot of videos coming up so i'm not sure when this one will be up but we're going to be doing the little selfies we're actually going to smoke so i did go ahead and smoke both of the indica pre-rolls already the medellin the medallion was the indica it comes in little two packs half grams so each are 0.25 grams there's selfies payroll so they're just little personal hits that you can do the medallion tested at 20.4 and less than 2 cbd when i smoked these and now let me tell you guys i don't think this is like super premium flour i think this is just for a quick on the go smoke for a nice little quick smoke i'm in a little you know easy to go packaging i don't think this is the most affordable pre-roll if that's what you're looking for for your money because for eight dollars for two um little pre-rolls that are 0.25 grams you could purchase a full gram per roll for like 10 bucks you know and get a little more worth your money but then again it's not going to come in the cute little packaging and it's not going to come in a little .25 gram it'll be a fuller one but that's completely up to you and there's tons of little selfies i'm not little selfies but little mini pre-rolls and joints that are out there now to try today we are going to be doing the one that i showed you guys a close-up of in this video which is the super glue so super glue is a hybrid strain this one tests at 20.4 as well now super glues origins um should be northern lights and skunk so let's go ahead and like this one up and see now if you guys look in my video it is really small like really tiny like i light it and it's gonna be gone in a second it's not even going to be a really long pre-roll video now i will say that it is like a super glue it has a very kind of um funky kind of taste to it to me it's not super sweet it's not super harsh it has a nice little white ash at the top of it here um where it's starting to burn i mean like two or three hits this will basically be done and you put it out so let's go ahead and hit it again so for a little pre-rolls that you could just take on the go with you guys you know if you're just pulling up somewhere and you just want something to just pull out and smoke on real quick this is like a fun little idea do i think this is the perfectly best tasting flower to be honest no i think it's okay it's not the worst flower ever smoked um doesn't taste just like trim or anything it does have a nice taste to it but it's not something that you know i pick up i would personally prefer to roll my blunts or joints if i'm gonna smoke them but yeah it has a nice white ash coming to it we'll also open the lime which is the sativa here on camera today too let me go ahead and grab the little clipper that i'm using for it because i don't know where any of my scissors have gone but the clipper works just fine to open them up we'll go ahead and pull one out looks just the same as the other one um this other little one is pretty much almost gone anyway but for a hybrid i would say this has a nice mellow taste to it it's not like a strong um too strong of like a taste to me to where it's you know unsmokable but i would say this definitely has more of an outdoorsy type taste to it because it is sun-grown pre-rolls most likely because it's eight dollars for two little mini pre-rolls it's cute packaging i like the little reflective packaging that they have um but just for a little on the go pre-roll i think that's the really only point to it the lime which is the sativa taste are tests at twenty point two percent thc less than two percent cbd let's go ahead and light the sativa one up and see how it is and hopefully i mentioned it when i was talking about the super glue but that one is a hybrid the medallion which is the one that i don't have to show you guys to smoke is the indica one which is this one right here because i tried to film the video before and it wasn't working now i will say these are cute these are cool um definitely like to throw in your purse or something or your backpack and not have it smell and just want to open one or two it's definitely nice because they're small also they don't really go out or anything so i think that's the nice thing of it too now when i also looked up the lime in the medellin just for kind of strain info for you guys i think the lime is more of just a lemonade lemon strained derivament um the medellin comes from specifically cookies brand flour they rolled out the medellin as a sun grown strain before i'm not too sure on the medallions madeans medan's origin um but i just wanted to go ahead and do a little fun little review because i haven't done many pre-roll videos i think only just the one which is the lift tickets that i did before for you guys but i'm going to go ahead and end the video here and thank you guys so much for watching if you guys want to write any comments or have any questions make sure to write them below if you guys

Dozo organic hemp 3.5 grams 3.5 grams does it tell me what it is oh it does it's right on top it is super haze one thing about the super haze is that shout out the east songs from esau CBD she told me that super haze is excellent for pain so I have I have a quarter to eight of super haze and I also have two Apes of electro a bit the lecture happens to be one of my favorite strengths I like it make sure because it's just it's a good day time strain into upper its see it's electric hence the name Elektra it gives you a little energy that lecture reminds me of the reminds me lifter in a way so I don't think you go wrong with little oil rector mr. pence also do you know what this is these are markets minute to pre-rolls three worlds my CBD heroes heroes yeah I got them pre-rolls pre-rolls my CBD heroes heroes um what do we have here this is from doze oh I like that name Dozo I don't know why but I don't like it a lot and what we have here is CBGB yeah yeah yeah don't forget the Jeep miss CBG this is a CBG pre row Jack Frost wood looks tasty it looks tasty okay we have the Jack Frost which is the CBG and we also have a CBG CPV this is a one to one this is a sativa Hawaiian haze and Jack Frost 15% Hawaiian hey is 17% news I like these so this is a wonder one of the these are the pre rose the hybrid I'm going to do the what I got to try out is this CBG I'm gonna try these CBG pre row this is the Jack Frost CBG pre run it's a fatty oh oh it's a penny oh my god Vicki look at that pre well I mean it's like so big it must be rolled by one of those rap guys or that guy from smoking legal and that's me big oh but I didn't roll it but it is nice this is a nice fatty so fat free Roku and it's in a raw tone kudos for that kudos for using the rock home that meet you to take the cheap route and just do some whatever car look luminous smells good it has a nice smell to it this is a Jack Frost I've never heard of Jack Frost it's everything mmm it's not loud but I guess that's because it's already in the pre-roll but it does have a nice smell to it not really kind it's earthy it has a slight little bit of pain but mainly earthy it smells good I like it a lot but some reason I'd be seeing people do this when they get their pre-rolls or anyone's they go yeah let's get to it I smoked all day and I'm high I'm risk to smoke so salute to health wealth and self self-love is the best love if you haven't heard the words I love you today then get to the closest meeting and say so I love you self you know why because you can't expect anyone else to love you or love anyone else if you don't love yourself first so yeah you know what self love is the best love syllable seemed Esprit CBG Zach Kraus CBG pre-roll I like the night and it's Jack gross yeah okay you know what these little tools these are glass they didn't take the cheaper up they can see they got the glass for the pre-rolls I like that a lot I'll keep these from our future pre-rolls I mean it's not really coming through yet there we go there we go okay why is this thing not pulling right I'm pulled in with this now pulling it's tasting good about an ounce net in this time it's not pulling good I'm a freak it a little bit as we like to say a lot of people ask me what a CB g ZB g is the mother cannabinoid CBG is where THC and CBD come from and smooth now it's hitting good yeah you see that smoke coming off at night now it's even good that Ash is nice and white that's in the CBD is the mother cannabinoid to me it it's silly CBG is silky it's like it's like the creamer to the coffee it just it's a very small smoke cpg it's coming in now CBG gives me a very calm feel a very chill relaxed feel after not smoking all day this is what's up I also just meet personally I like CVG more in the afternoon I don't know why I see me Jesus for real for real relaxes me this Jack Frost is pretty tasty it tastes good um the flavor profile is not really strong only because I'm having to pull so hard on this pre row never go they are nails in now that's that smooth creamy taste that I like that's what I'm used to with CNG and it's this Jack brows I don't know why but it has a familiar taste it's reminding me of another strain I can't quite think of it but it's good I like it I was hidden now now is hitting the arm it still has that earthy taste this is gonna sound weird right but it it it kinda has a little bit of I don't know if it's the CBD or just the strain Jack Frost but it has like a little bit of that papaya taste to it if you like retires then you know exactly what I'm talking about very smooth though I mean CBG is very smooth it's tasting it's very smooth very tasty okay okay jack brows okay then okay then I see you I see you I see you Dozo Dozo CBD I see you even though I think this is more for the afternoon it's so smooth that I want it with a glass of coffee I want it with some coffee because city is just a smooth Strang I can't wait to try the Silver Haze in the electro and this is the CBD CBD to CBD that seems like that's gonna be good as well but the pre-roll the jackpot is the little eagle the only thing I would say though does the flower taste good when please make sure you put the notice to law enforcement in there please make sure you put the seal ways in there always every single time every single time - you may not want to roll the pre-roll so tight because I took about it had to get burning about a quarter of the way down before it starts hitting like I wanted it to be hidden but other than that it's good it's smooth as silk the taste is like I said the taste is kind of earthy it's palpable it's a light smoke you can pull hard as I want and I'm not gonna show I'm not gonna tell I don't like it I do like it I come excited about trying to own them so well I just it's just packed so tight that it's then that's done if I expect so tight that it's kind of hard to enjoy it's hard it's hard to pull I'm really having to pull this I like him I like to just pull it easy and make it easy like that but this is a little bit difficult but anyway other than that I do like it see your ways needed notice to my enforcement need it and don't pack it so tight but other than that you got something good going as I like to say you know smoking legal you know how we do keep it positive we'll keep it pushing you need keep it positive or keep it pushing uh if you haven't had CBG this is a this is a good one I like I like CVG a lot more companies are trying to get that is out there so yeah does up do Co I like it does oh it's a good one does LCPD calm people", "NsP97DcbRWU": "[Music] [Applause] my head's so messed up but i can't fall to no fear guys i sit right up on these bands and i'm gonna use the white tears five years still sticking to the

hard in a cold world ever since you left i don't know what's next i ain't found closer i keep a knife in my chest just to cut holes off i don't know i'm leaving a [ __ ] in the past i gotta go now what's up guys welcome back if you watched the last video and uh hello if you're new here um today we're about to smoke one of these west coast cure pre-rolls provided to us by jacob thank you very much jacob thank you i'm really hyped about those i've heard a lot of good reviews on west coast cures um i've never smoked one before i don't y'all never smoked one before right that's happening i tapped two hits off of one of these but haven't really got like a full experience okay cool and um i'll let you spark this thing up buddy this is chrisley i like how they put it in raw joints i like raw papers so i think that's pretty cool use that all natural taste yeah [Music] a little harsh [Music] damn this is pulling yeah you can't hear the [ __ ] section it stinks damn duncan it smells like some gas for me this is gonna be an easy hot box it does so now that i've gotten into it a little bit it's got a nice little it's got a nice little gassy taste to it under the i swear i think it's that keef it's super it's got a little stink to it for sure dude i mean it looks very hard so that [ __ ] pulls like i mean it pulls like shotgun like i really don't think it tastes that bad compared to other pre-rules we've had not many at least i mean it does have that pre-roll flavor but it's i i expected it to be hard yeah i mean this is [Music] perfect [Music] i hope our youtube channel gives you nostalgic memories and when you used to hang out with your bros and you smoke up or you're chilling with your brains and watching yes we're all bros here this is not bad it's not bad at all i mean [Music] that [ __ ] was yellow yeah he took a [ __ ] that was kind of nasty it's not bad i mean you can you could tell like it's probably a little a little old you know what i mean not the pre-roll of the bud sitting on the shelf a little too long yeah you got to get a pre-roll like the day they made that [ __ ] i mean like at least a week after they made it but like i mean [ __ ] bird there's no telling when they made think about it and you roll a joint right and you just have that [ __ ] sitting there for like a month right it's not going to taste like it did you do that exactly yeah that's what i mean like they need that you need to like if somebody rolled that [ __ ] or made that [ __ ] like that day that's fire i don't want a [ __ ] live resident or keith that's been sitting there for like a month or some [ __ ] bro like yeah facts look at him god damn it that's more expensive than milo and he doesn't even realize that's two of him like they make you buy cats be called or like buy pets really i mean when you go to a pet store and you have to buy it for like 40 dollars like you were just saying bro that's like it's just weird like you're kind of helping them you're helping them out by taking that cat off their hands so it's like i don't know why you're having fun and pay for it yeah that's what i'm saying like that i got it from an actual shelter and like they uh they make you pay adoption fees for the shots and they give it a chip beforehand and all that stuff and they also give you free they give you free like a chip yeah there's a chip in it just in case it got lost and they brought it back to the pound they could check it for a chip and it's got my number on it inside of them yeah it's like under his ear bro he's like [ __ ] he's like a clone bro order 66 right right like this like dude imagine one day just like all the cats that have chips and him like just [ __ ] somebody from the pet store is like executed 466 they just all start killing their [ __ ] owners and cats with [ __ ] machine guns [ __ ] blazer machine guns taking them out there's like yes my lord there's her like it's like the slice and jacob starting to sleep and she's liking rick and morty with the the dog had the [ __ ] robot suit yeah yeah that's a dude that was a good [ __ ] episode dude while he's taking that little hit here you want to talk a little bit about what you thought of that west coast uh yeah i mean i thought it was all right i mean like i said it's definitely not a fresh pre-roll so it's hard to tell like if it was like a brand new one i guarantee you it's really [ __ ] fire you'd definitely tell that was like it's pretty old but it got me high but that's all that matters i guess at the end of the day you know what i mean but yeah i mean the taste and everything it wasn't really there it was it was okay it was all right it was i gave it about like a a six and a half because it got me like high but like taste wise and stuff it was not there in my opinion but that like i said that's an older one so i'm not going to sit there and say like west coast here suck because i've heard really good things about them so i might have got like a dud kind of yeah i mean i bought this a week ago for the video yeah exactly so yeah i mean there and it probably was like made weeks before that so yeah if not yeah so this is what you the price you pay when you're getting a a three roll in my opinion i think the pre-roll it wasn't i'm on the same page but ever wasn't anything special when it came to the flavor um but i definitely would say it accelerated my heart yeah yeah for sure we were already kind of getting before we started so yeah i mean it got me high so i feel like it just um it's cool all in all like it was good it got me high and like that's what i want um i just feel like the taste wasn't there you know like it just it and i mean that is that's what you're you know you're gonna get with pre-roll that's what i said today yeah so all in all it was a pretty good point i mean i or joint it got me high i mean that's that's what matters yeah so pretty much we all said the same thing yeah i i pretty much about have the same the same thing to say i mean it was really it got me high it was a nice uh a nice feel and everything it was smooth but the flavor that i wanted out of pre-roll for that kind of price just wasn't there yeah i expect more of it it's probably like trim or shake that's been sitting in that you know in that joint for like months and i mean it's like i said earlier you know if you if you roll a joint of some gas right top shelf even you sit that [ __ ] in in the cabinet for like what a month even if you put it in a nice little glass jar sealed up it's not going to taste the same it's just not dude and that that's the case i got high i mean i know there's some gas in there because i'm high and there was five heads on that so i mean i noticed some gas dude don't get me wrong um especially if you take a dab after that you know you get really stunned there's some pre-rolls though that like are [ __ ] insane bro but like it's just like you're asking for like a hundred dollars for one joint so that's just just not me but like that's okay you're smoking like four grams in one joint which is cool i get it like it honestly it equals up to 100 but like i just don't want to smoke all that at once i want to save my [ __ ] but that [ __ ] is probably like where it's at that's probably those are probably the pre-rolls you're really going for you're probably not gonna find a solid pre-roll that's only like a gram and it's just strictly but you know i mean like you need to pre-roll with dabs or some live resin in it some [ __ ] like that really get a good taste out of it but you get to say the option buddy okay uh what do i need to say did you just say it dude now y'all got me like thinking all that [ __ ] guys all right i gotta get um wait a second all right so uh yeah thanks for watching the video um so or all right whatever milo is hungry dude dude just do it then if you want to do i don't know the [ __ ] favor all right do you want to do it again endeavor yeah um all right

"I just wanted to show you guys this individually I've showed these in a previous video but I didn't review these individually CBD hemp direct sells some pre-roll some options include 1 Grand Prix rolls 3 gram and a jazzy pre-roll joint with Keith infused in it now I've smoked one of these and a little risk associated with this is that this one here with the wrap on it and with all the bud that came into it when I put this on the scale it comes out at 4 grams it's about even when I put one of these two on it it comes out at like 2.8 so that's obviously less than the 3 grams of flour that you're supposed to begin so for the 15 dollar price that these are they really while 3 grams of flour is worth $15 these things go pretty quickly I was lucky enough to get these as add-on items before CBD hemp direct updated their website and got rid of add-on items so these were definitely worth the add-on price but I don't think that with what you get out of these pre rolls here that they're really worth like 12 bucks or 810 a gram you know this one I think you can get it for like 8 bucks I got it for 5 and I feel like it's barely worth the 5 so if you are a fan of pre-rolls and you were curious as to what you'll get with CBD hemp directs payrolls they blunts are juicy J hand perhaps they aren't tobacco wraps so they're a lot smoother and they are absolutely full of flavor the strawberry is actually really really strong and the natural I thought this was gonna be more of like a green tobacco leaf flavor but this is actually like a very light vanilla very very pleasant if I were to go back and get more pre-rolls from them I would just order Naturals the tubes that they come in are really cool though this the the reason I bought this pre-roll here was just because I wanted the screw top tube the one gram pre-rolls you might get this with the quark super satisfying to hold CBD hemp directs buds are you know little harsh so you know keep that in mind when you're ordering this these are the AC diesel strains they used to use cherry wine but they upgraded their pre-rolls to AC diesel so if you were curious and wanted to see a pre-roll in size comparison before ordering one this is what you'll get", "3zecCiJsYsg": "[Music] uh [Music] okay radio first session so you sort of have an idea of each other you are going to board a ship known as the iss teemo and i'm waiting to see yeah where we go it's an erickson class scout ship it's um a little bit different than the average normal expected scout ship they seem to be long thin needly like things this is shorter more broader [Music] it's been modified so in traditional games of cps or scout or traveler you have jump and you have non-jump drives in this game you have non-jump drives which is your your petrol fuel stuff or your whatever you have hop skip and jump drives so hop drives are drives that do a partial jump within a solar system they they can't jump they can't jump out of a solar system but like if you're going from one side to the other side you could use a hop drive skip is what we call the standard jump drive jumping a parsec two three four five six and then you have what we now call the jump drive jump drive is a bit of new technology and what it does for the added cost and taking up a bit of room it gives your jump your sorry skip drive a multiplier so your ship normally can jump two one or two it's got a multiply of 1.5 it takes a bit more fuel and a bit more room which means your ship can technically jump a one two or a three which gives it a lot more versatility the ship has one turret it has two entire two types of lasers steve's trying to quickly get through the book to find out what they are um i thought you said they were laser cannons they are laser types but you have two swords you have beam and you have pulse so a beam one i think is easier to hit with and a pulse one does more damage when it does hit um or it's the other way around for them i just you never remember which way it goes [Music] but anyway so i've got the stats somewhere and i've damned myself if i can't find them i do know that you don't have as much cargo space as it it says there you do or what it looks like you only have because you're also carrying an extra half ton of life support which means that that gives you eight more weeks of life support for one person there's four of you so that extends your life support by two weeks so you can do a jump three you've got six weeks of life support and you've got enough fuel to give the duration of a month i think it is is it a month yes i'm pretty sure it's a month or two weeks i found the page on the turrets yep that's page 69. cool i was very close there's one page out so there's pulse lasers and particle beams uh yeah no you don't have the beams beam lasers are weak but accurate yeah they get a plus one whereas the pulse laser oh hang on ah there you go pulse pulse laser gives you two hits when it hits as opposed to the blending laser which only gives you one hit yeah yeah um yeah our ideal for point defense and hit incoming missiles this is a pulse laser at a base row of gunnery six plus rather than a gunnery ten plus they're powerful but accurate causing two hits on targets but attacking at a minus two to hit ordinary targets so you have a pulse and you have a beam oh we haven't one of each yep or one of each okay but they're both in the in the turret at the back open so you so you like do you fire one or the other or can you fire both you fire both okay yep um and i'll walk when we get should we get i don't expect us to get ship combat straight away yeah um probably in the game or two depends on how badly the first encounters go i guess or how well they go with the aliens that you may meet so the other part of the story is that you'll see in the house rules i don't think there's most of the house rules were to do with generation and some of the changes made to the game so like if you have a characteristic that's five or less it's a minus one and i think um matt your character has a minus one on their social if you have a nine to eleven it's a plus one if you have a twelve it's a plus two and i don't think anyone's got a twelve at the moment so that's that's the bonus you get um if it's associated to school and say add in your characteristic bonus there's no such thing as deception skill you've got to role play that out um you are playing the medic you're playing is also a surgeon because you meet both requirements level 3 doctor amid and uh 10 or plus dexterity so you can do surgery um um interrupt you real quick uh what is my dexterity uh because i'm not seeing in the attributes 10 then okay ten yep um so the only thing uh they bought you a shotgun but i don't think they've brought you any other sort of weapon um last week anthony and dean filled up the ship's locker so you've got a tech level 9 i think it is space suit it does the job and i think they've bought some shotguns for the defending the ship you've got your own shotgun um i don't know if you're gonna have bought a you don't have any melee um skill you might want to have a dagger if you want i don't know um when we get into combat i'll talk about the combat rules which is the second half of the house rules and it just changes in cepheus engine um it's different to trevor in that it's it's about penetrating the armor and doing damage um but their combat the hand-to-hand combat was different so it was two sort of separate systems so i've tried to make hand-to-hand combat as close as possible to ship to ship combat so they tend to sort of share some um of the basic mechanics so it's not having to re-learn things all over again so if remington for argument's sake i'll just do this quickly if remington needed to roll for surprise okay so remington is not on the merch he's in the merchants which is not a military so he and he doesn't have a leadership skill um he doesn't have recon and he doesn't have tactics okay so head roller d6 and the other side rolls of d6 add up their bonuses and whoever gets three or more gets one round of surprise which means they get around to do something horrible to the other side or flee up to them whatever they want to do most times you get surprised you want to take them out because combat can be deadly um as you probably found out which version of traveler did you play playmat um i think version two is what they were saying classic mongoose mongoose 2 mongoose traveler 2 is the the quarter rule book that i've been looking through okay so cepheus is much closer to classic traveler it takes some ideas from cepheus it takes a lot of the updating of the tech um and employing it in the game but that's sort of as close as it gets so that's sort of where we'll sort of things will get a little bit fuzzy but don't worry as your game goes by you'll probably make sense of it more yeah that's fine we'll learn on the role cool okay so coming down to the i haven't given everyone a little figurine yet i'm hoping you don't need it um just yet i'm hoping we can just um get by flying and doing things so this so a sector is four sub-sectors wide and four sub-sectors down these two rectangles are a sub-sector okay they measure eight light years across and i think it's 10 light years um north south so you are the one that you you are in is this one here you know i'll just get us all to that one i don't know which one of these buttons does it there we go so up in the top left hand corner is the planet euron called terminus if we think about it in the sector it's the four by four it's the bottom most right most subsector the big subsector next to it is three by three so it's on a diagonal so they sort of match up on those two points so you're jumping from terminus past the veil the vowel is a spatial anomaly that creates a whole lot of havoc and it goes for quite a distance um i haven't got the whole subset to map the whole sector map done yet but i've just done this basic stuff just to get us started because you don't need the rest of the human subject to map because you're leaving that behind on your very first jump um you do have the set to your jump subject you're jumping into you do have that information so you know that's where the stars are okay so the other thing you can do if you happen to be just one jump away and you're thinking of jumping to that star you can do a it would be raised doing it it's a navigation role because what he's trying to do is interpret the aggregation data to see if there's enough wobble or something that would indicate that there's a huge gas type planet in system where you could gain fuel from okay because fuel obviously you jump you burn most of it up and you have to find a way to replenish that um but that's only available one one hex out of your current position unfortunately you don't get that on the first jump you're jumping in blind hoping that you can get through the veil with this new um engine technology and end up on a planet that's either got water or has a gas giant around it well exactly so this um venture is being funded by two agencies one is a intergalactic university i'll make up the name of it and the other is a merchant cartel of three different merchant carrier companies basically and i've got to work out what your um we did work it out and i can't remember sorry what remington's cash is but basically everyone's taking a two month advance so they've got money to buy stuff with and have money on hand to barter with to try to buy things that they need on the trip yeah i think i'm looking at twenty five thousand yep yep um so the rest the ten thousand will be given to you sorry the the ten months worth on your return to terminal you'll gain all that money back plus anything that you happen to have made the information done wanting obviously two different sorts so the university is interested in what you find any information about the veil any information about the alien races behind the veil so any information is what they're after the mercantile cartel is after a mercantile base so they want to know resources they want to know if there's a equivalent trading price of things they want to know if there are suitable star ports that they could establish themselves out and like move out into that once they get past the veil so this is purely business orientated so you're keeping two different sets so i'm going to say that remington um you're actually responsible for keeping all of the mercantile data whereas raise is responsible for keeping all of the educational social technological historical all that sort of data biological all that stuff okay jack you might be able to throw in some information about technology because you've got a pretty good handle on technology um and not yet jack yeah oh no jack no that's garth sorry garth jack is your security guy his one job is to keep you three alive go yeah that's what he's got to do so he doesn't have to worry about anything about just keeping you guys alive he's also the best person to be in a firefight with because he is something like a basic plus three to his uh surprise role i think before we even start calculating anything else nice yeah he's he's very very good he can lead surprise i think so opposite of me yeah where's the surprise you you calculate it from all your skills so you you um you have leadership that's one yeah we're in the you're in a military thing that's two um you have recon one tact and that's three so before i even start calculating anything else you've got a plus three on your dice yeah okay um which makes you really good in a fire fight because you you are liable unless they have some sort of alien biological advantage you're liable to get the uh jump on them yeah okay you also the person who guns uses the gunnery yes yes that's okay so we'll be using beyond the valve the audio chat for our audio and if you look up above you'll see beyond the veil which is just a text chat to chuck anything in the information or any questions in between games and any other thing you want to put in there you can have a look all the other stuff um the only one that you can't really do anything about is callum terra because that's a friend of mine who is using this server to play his fantasy game on um but all the others are mine so that's not a problem so with that uh double plus wrong fun productions that's what we're called is going to start the game so you're given your final instructions you know the risk you could very well finish before you start jumping in across the veil is dangerous many ships for many hundreds of years have tried to cross the veil no one has come back they've never received a message from anyone so it's a pretty um steady sort of um steadying thought that you could jump and then just something horrible happens to you in your show the other so therefore there is going to be those who survive will also get a bonus of 50 000 credits danger money danger money danger money yeah that's just like hazard pay kinda okay uh i won't say no to money yeah okay so um now there's a certain set of things that you go through before every jump so obviously first of all you make sure you've refueled you've re-re life support and at the moment you're full on both of those which is all cool um if you are in an atmosphere the pilot would then make a parting role to get out of the atmosphere because going into an atmosphere you make a piling roll because you suddenly go from space to atmospheric which can be quite dangerous for a ship to go into the pilot makes that role to get out of atmosphere and you do have an atmosphere although it's very thin atmosphere you'll still be making that pilot roll then you go out to the jump distance you must always be 100 diameters and i've got a little table that tells me how long it takes you at whatever g you're doing and this ship i think goes one or two g that's um that's how fast it can travel or accelerate um depending on how fast you want to leave you have to travel up to a hundred diameters that's where you can make a safe jump if you do it inside of the planet you're on yup if you jump from 10 diameters out to 100 diameters you have a monstrous chance of blowing up okay or miss jumping if you try to take off and do that on the planet or within 10 diameters it's pretty assured you are going to miss jump and it's probably that you're going to blow up as well but if you jump at 100 or more diameters that usually is the damaging point from the point you leave the planet's atmosphere to the hundred diameters is where you might have an encounter with pirates or some other ships that sort of stuff so you just got to be careful about that whether they're pirates or whether they are normal ships and there's certain codes that are sent um so like you get hailed they usually give you the name of the ship and the name of the captain and requesting who's the captain's name of the ship in your ship they just because your ships send out um a signal a transponder it has which the any ship can pick up so and if you're worried if you've got someone who's on sensors and raised that's going to be you you're going to have to work out from the sensing data you get in whether or not you trust the transponder or not if you've got a concern that something is not quite right so you do that just to verify that what the transponder's picked up is what they are once you get out to uh but also you can get people to try to trick you and um like pirates and all that sort of stuff you may also get boarded or checked with customs that's usually on the way in it's very very rarely on the way out unless something really big has happened on planet in the searching to see if something or someone has escaped but you kind of know what you're heading into on that on that side of things once you get up to 100 diameters the first role is that you engaged well first of all why are you getting out there it's just assumed that the pilot is making the navigational inputs now if you're going into space where you have no navigational inputs and you have no navigation you know where the stars are so you can definitely aim for the stars although you don't want to go for the stars but you don't know where the planets are because you don't pick up any planets this far out so you're just taking potluck you could end up like you come out above orbit of a planet you come out inside a planet if you're really really unlucky or you can come out close to but not too far or on the opposite side of the star system so there are some tricks on that sort of stuff that i'm assuming that your character will just be doing raise being the pilot navigator that he is he'll just do those basic things but if you have to and remember the three things you need in this game to have a chance of succeeding is the skill the resources and the time so if time is very rare and you're only relying on skill or resources that's when you could have trouble when you re-engage out of jump okay so yeah so the first thing you do all that the the next thing that the engineer will roll his star engineering or sorry he should be all the time checking the engines pre and post jump to make sure nothing's gone wrong the engineer makes one roll to see whether the ship's going to blow up as it enters jump yay usually you've got to roll really high to have that happen so you don't want double sixes usually double six as long as you're using what's called refined fuel and you're not doing a hasty jump you're fine you'll never do that it's when time's short or you've had to use unrefined fuel that you start having problems with a jump um then after that on a refined fuel is that just like raw that's you you scoop gas out of a gas giant yeah you've got okay you've got things that can you can automatically then jump with what you've gathered or you can wait because your ship can produce five tons of fuel per day of refined fuel um oh so we can mine that and then turn it into refined fuel yeah yeah um you can't have refined and unrefined it automatically goes to unrefined if you're mixing it in your fuel system and sometimes you can only have unrefined because you don't have the time you might be chased by a pirate or something you just want to get enough fuel to jump out of there um but most times you'll probably be able to find a gas giant scoop from a gas giant that's a piling roll um and then once you're full head in system once you've detected where the actual main system planet is because this is different to traveler because that's usually all very well known and all planned out in this game you've got lots of unknowns so you're gonna because it's new i've only thought up a couple of systems on the fly so if you can think of other systems that seem reasonable and safe try them because we might adopt them as part and parcel of how this game is played i like doing so matt just sometimes just by the skin of your teeth because i like that sort of adventure and that sort of high risk sort of thing i hope you don't mind because that's how we're going to go cool um then the pilot makes his role uh again modifiers with um if it's a time factor or if he's too close to a planetary mass or if i think there's unrefined fuel i'm not sure i'll look that one up i think that's only for the explosion but there's other things that happen you don't roll against your it's just a flat dice with these modifiers um and if you fail again rolling really high you miss jump so you can miss jump with these engines normally it's a random d6 direction because you're using hexes six d6 up to 66 hexes away so six times six or one times six or whatever the dice are yeah but because you're using a jump drive that becomes the d6 times d6 times 1.5 hexes away so you could technically jump around about 48 light years from where you want to be awesome yup so as you can tell if you go diagonally one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14. there's only 14 hexes maximum diagonally in a sub-sector so you're looking at like three and a half of those so um are there like if somebody else i guess in the on the ship has a um i don't know like uh any piloting or just kind of skills can they kind of help them out you know and like grant them a boon is that the thing so that's that that is called your aiding so what happens if you can aid you've got to have a skill a level one at least you do the pre-roll if you're successful depending on how much effect you get like if you make an eight that's a plus one if you make a 10 no sorry if you make a 12 that's right 20 plus one if you make a 12 that's a plus two and then they roll modified by your roll and this there's their modifiers on that final role here so you can support somebody as long as you've got the prerequisite skills or you've got complementary skills complementary skills i haven't played with yet but we're going to try this in this game but it's probably only going to be half as effect and i'm not sure i'm going to do that because yeah sometimes that rounds to 0.5 and i'll have to make a call on that depending on those three things i said time resources and skill yep so with my so with my piloting skill could i go ahead and make a like a helping role um probably not flying the ship no but you could because you you've got parting one is that correct that's what it looks like yep and navigation zero yeah yep okay no no you do in this game when you get pilot you automatically get navigation but how i've played it if you get one you pick pilot or navigation which is your primary and i think i've picked pilot for the character so you automatically you've got never zero so you can still make a nav roll to support i'm looking at yeah i'm just looking at the skills on like in front of me on the on the character sheet that's all i see yep so if there is something that's navigation make sure it's a zero not a negative something because it should be zero um so yeah so that that's that's a possibility i like um we'll try and evolve the system as we go um and if it's not i mean i'll i'm all for dramatic moments but if it's just like it's all about like all your hard work's going to be done done perhaps we won't use those systems um we'll see how the game goes okay so you're about to leave terminal everything's on board you've done your preflight checks normally there are roles so actually i'll start getting you guys to get used to that so anthony for garth if you can give me his engineering role with a plus two and if he's got education a high enough education use the modifier for education on the engineering role uh education is eight no modifier oh that's not good that's a one okay as far as jack knows everything's fine and everything's everyone's sorry i'm so comfortable with that i i didn't i rolled as jack not garth does that matter well you're rolling gar stuff that way yeah yeah yeah that's okay just just remember um under the chat windows swap when you go to airs rolling for someone else that's all there will come up so we'll do that swap it and roll again and see what you get with the modifiers so 2d6 plus 2 plus 1 i think for your intel education holy okay great start okay the first one no it's even more garth is even more sure that everything's fine hey it's a refurbished ship but it should be totally fine get out the spanner and bang something see it sounding perfect to me goes over and tips checks it against his head yeah taps a couple of gauges yeah the needle seemed to move lights are flashing we're all good to go down on the engineering bay perhaps okay so here's another thing anytime you go into space the other group because of the nature of the game they're never sure when they come out of jump what they're going to come into so they always do several things everyone gets to position so gunners and gunnery engineers in engineering everyone where they need to be sort of thing they then um um suckle the atmosphere out of the ship into back into the tanks yeah cool yeah so this um suckle the atmosphere back in the tank so that should they have an explosive decompression from a missile hit or a laser hit it doesn't happen so they don't lose a lot of stuff um and in their game they've got a pilot and a navigator separate so the navigator always takes over the sensor controls and does the initial common communication and sweeps the area for context and all the other sort of stuff looks out for the automated messages all that sort of thing you've got one person that's gonna have to do all that that's quite difficult but you've got to do all that um raise because that's your role what you could do though since uh remington is not actually needed anywhere else he could be your assistant on in the cockpit let me let me ask you this as well um the jumps usually take like quite quite quite a long time right one week one week so i could possibly be um what's it called training or researching or doing something to advance another skill okay the so that brings me on to that normally in the game you're in a universe where you have access to study materials and exams and all that sort of stuff for this next year because you've got six months to go as far as you can and then six months to get back for the next year you're not going to have access to that so it's going to be very hard to train what i do do though is every time you roll doubles be they sixes or ones or twos or four whatever every time you roll doubles you add a 0.1 to whatever skill they just applied to when it clocks over from a point nine it would would take it up one you make a dedication role or d8 uh sorry two six you make an eight or better your skill now through experience clocks up to the next level and you start all over again if you fail the role it drops back down to zero and you're gonna start all over again with no advancement in the level i just call that um advancement through experience okay that works yeah just the little mechanic there so just make sure you take note of when you roll doubles okay gotcha because i'm not gonna look for them you got to point them out to me otherwise they don't get it yeah yeah okay so so we've had um garth checking the engines and tell you everything's fine better than fine lights are beeping gauges are moving something's happening with the jump with the um power plant and the maneuver drives you're all good to go there captain all right this apartment say let's go raise the roof okay so you now have got to make literally yeah okay so in this sort of system matt you would be if you're in the cockpit with the captain just taking over the um communication senses so do you have um i don't know if you do do you have computers do you have one perfect okay then you are the perfect person for that job um okay so you'd be taking all the sensory data uh you'd be taking in like initial uh contacts giving away your um name name the captain and that of the day you'd be the como officer as well as the sensor officer as well as yeah all that stuff okay so yep so you'd be um talking to the tower right now saying you're ready to take off and waiting for them to give you the victor feed that into the pilot who then could use that to take off let's go okay so we'll take it as that's been done by remington yeah cool and but no no next time i'm gonna leave it up to you because if you go do something i gotta do it okay yeah i'm just going just it just carries on and um what happens happens uh all right so yeah so as jack should i be sitting on the turret right now or would i just be chilling with helping out i mean i'd say i'd say like all like stations man right yeah we're better the unknown space yeah well you're gonna jump from known space into unknown so yeah i'd be i'd be sitting in the train wouldn't it so everyone's vex suited up yep cool okay great because you need an eight um okay so you take off um it's pretty smooth sailing this guy knows how to pilot the ship um so remington you're just okay and checking all the chickens they sort of say bond bid your bond farewell and you're on your vector you're heading out raised to 100 diameters this is normally where i check for an encounter i know there's none because this is but  nowhere basically this little planet it's the end of the road basically so you don't meet anything out here if you do it's it's very rare and it's probably a pirate so um can you please give me my eye out regardless hi hi um so can you give me a roll please matt for a sensor sweep just checking to make sure everything is clear in your flight path so two six plus one um eight that's nice that's what you need so everything's clear the ship's on the victor you're feeling quite happy um steve's looking for travel here we go now captain as i said your ship can go either 1g or 2g i believe let's go 2g okay so to get from the ground to planets you orbit at 2g takes you 23 minutes boom you're there you're out into space so um let's have a ground to typical planetary jump point four hours it's going to take you four hours to get about a hundred diameters away so that's four hours potentially where things can go wrong you've got your sensor guy making sweeps so you're not going to accidentally fly into a medius micro media swarm and and hold your hull and you're not going to be there's no encounters as such at the moment so you get to the jump point this is where one moment before you do anything anthony i want to make sure that they haven't turned this on its head and it's double ones that are the danger point would i have jack help um gaff with anything before the jump no no your role is strictly gunning and gunning and i think you've got some gunning in there yeah i got gunnery yeah yeah and gunning and i think you've got some gunning as well gunnery what's the difference between gunning gunnery nothing i'm just saying you got a lot you've been the security officer that's your one sort of thing if you like all right just trying to find the bloomin because i don't have it as tables at the moment so i'm just trying to find the jumps jump modifiers unless they haven't okay calculate plot engage drive jump okay here we go so to jump through 2d with the following dm's a throw of zero or less causes a miss jump okay so they have reduced it um engineer engaged drives so okay this is your engineering role okay so once the jump plot is ready the chips engineer must throw engineering of six or better to power the jump drive this procedure takes a second and can be done in the same round as the jump throw itself so this will happen simultaneously so first of all there you go mr engineer garth try this again hold up that's not bad yeah it is double fives so on a piece of paper somewhere in the notes put down plus point one to engineering oh yeah okay so the shipping engine has been engaged correctly now it's back down to the pilot to make sure you don't jump into a bad place so you're gonna roll 2d6 hang on second i throw zero less causes than this jump so um okay we better go back you've got to make a calculating point so this is where the two of you in the cockpit i've gone past a step sorry because they have changed things slightly so first of all matt you make a supporting role with your nav zero you've got to make an eight because you've got zero you can still make it as a oh not this time okay rodeo throwing up everything looks good on the sensors yeah i don't sense anything no um you're wearing your helmet backwards oh that'll be it okay i thought it was dark in here okay okay pilot you calculate your own jump point now um i'm assuming you're going for you're not jumping to be 100 diameters away from the star you're jumping in by the spectral type of planet it is to this suspected life zone yeah yes so each one has a different you know like little red giant dwarfs they are very close to the star our ones are sort of a little bit further out the big ones are like way way out so this one is a red giant so you're going to be going in fairly close um so i need you to make a piloting role to calculate the jump plot um yep but don't forget your nav is not plus two oh sorry navigation not piloting yeah that's okay it still makes an eight you can just click the text right you know what you can just click the text and it makes the roll you don't have to add the modifier to it click what text in your skills like say you've got admin you can just click admin and it will put the role there yeah and ask you the modifier as well you don't have to add it every time yeah okay so if i go if i click piloting yep and then you just click okay or add a modifier if you have to yeah but the good news is what a pity that wasn't the role yeah but that's okay yeah yep so um radios so jump is fine jump drive is damaged using unrefined fuel no within 100 diameters it's a minus eight okay 2d6 flat 2d6 raise 9. you are not misjumping everything went smoothly you're now in jump going in for the kill so to speak i don't know perhaps you are going for the kill um over to this star here on 0809 the only thing you know about it is it's a red dwarf so if there are going to be any habitable planets they're going to have to be fairly close to it um and you sort of aim roughly for the life zone so um can i uh since we're i guess in regular space again should i make another sensors roll no no no you you've got a week and jump oh so we're still going okay yeah so what you can do guys because it doesn't require any study as you can commit yourself to a four-year physical fitness regime what that means is you you can do that for four years you make two rolls you make a double a 2 6 roll if you get eight or more your three physical stats the first three stats go up by one at the end of the four years you've got to remember to do this you make another roll if you continue for another four years if you make that role and you continue for another four years that becomes permanent if you fail they all fall back down one and you have to start over from scratch so um we make the roll right now if you are committing it yep if you're committing yourself to physical fitness regime and that's something you can do i didn't get it nope i got doubles though petty you can't use it on anything ah not quite okay it's hard it is hard okay i'd like to have a sleep and roll again after i wake up and finally oh and then i gotta roll with the other guys yeah him being the physical guy he's the only one that gets it a bitcher no not jack okay none of you can do it for another four years that's the problem yeah okay so you pretty much gave up on the second day that was it um okay you've got to weaken the hyperspace it's up to you what you want to do whether there's maintenance on the ship you have to do there might be stuff so in the engineering section you'll have a small print shop they'll be able to print off basic replacement parts some parts you won't be able to because they're a specific or specialized metal or chemical but roughly 90 of the parts on your ship you can fabricate for yourself if you need to you can also use that to repair guns providing the person who is operating it has they have to have a level one in the gun skill cool so i guess um if i'm uh if we're just like cruising i guess i could do like the computer thing like the scanner thing can i maybe look through sensors and see if there are any errors i guess on the ship some will need to i don't know take a look at any any like alerts okay yep so you check the ship over um you won't need to make a computer check for that it's a pretty standard um thing so you're just checking the ship for any unknown cracks that develop or any anything that's odd or off there is nothing odd or off um there's no damage being reported back by the automated systems everything's fine it's turning to be boring did anyone think to buy any hollow vids to bring on oh i knew i forgot something yeah okay so they do have a couple there's three in the library um one is of the um now so there's three races in this game from the human perspective the human empire the the there is the hoenn which is the dog race that dean is there's canoos which is like like race and there's humans so you have found some adult canoes porn which looks more like a wildlife documentary to you but you know it's something to entertain yourself with um and there's another very boring um safety first um film that every ship has so i make so i say to everyone all right team it's our first day together let's make sure we do this right we're going to watch a safety video okay it's all about 25 minutes do you what sorry oh no no go on okay all righty so you watch through that it's boring as all get up and yes you know everything and but you all have watched it you can all tick the box um the third one is a really really obscure um old piece of um human entertainment um it's yeah you're not quite sure it's something called star trek it's highly inaccurate totally inaccurate um you know um yeah the the huge mistakes they have yeah but that's all you've got but you've got the entire series i guess i just uh i plant the ass on the on the couch or the chair and i guess that's what i do for four weeks was it one week when we can jump yep okay um you could also being the doctor you could check your equipment um make sure it's all going working and everything i'll go ahead and put that off until the last few days okay i'll check i'll check every like couple of hours and check you know the senses and stuff too yep everything's right or no no there's nothing in jump space um the one thing in jump space you never do is look into jump space so or any pools you've got will be shuttered yeah i'm not going to tell you what happens if you look into some space but two players have already done that and they know what happens but they're not going to tell anyone let's just say it ended in death so so we've got no and no form of internet research capability even i think everything we have we have to take with us pretty much yeah yeah you've got and we've got is a library data but all it has on it is the spectral type of stars and their positions um which help you extricate um you pretty much are going to be filling in the blanks okay so i'm a surgeon you said right um i've got the could i maybe like um i don't know uh do like implants and stuff like if i had an implant could i you know implant that into somebody or myself probably not to yourself unless it's a very minor thing um i guess i'd have to check i don't know what's going on in the storage i guess like yeah can i go ahead and like check over the uh the medical supplies and see if there's anything interesting in there um yep so the ship's locker i think has two additional yeah i bought two kits med kits you've bought on a whole lot of medical uh drugs and stuff the rest is pretty basic stuff so you can do surgery it's it's more sort of field surgery than anything else or what you would consider field surgery although you can make the entire area sterile on that it doesn't have auto dock it doesn't have all little automated things that can do like hypnos sprays and all that sort of stuff you're gonna have to do all by yourself or haul one of the other guys in to do some of the heavy lifting for you while you do the more delicate stuff gotcha um but and and unfortunately you'll be using your stateroom as the sickbay nice yay um yeah um um so with my repairs electronics and mech skills would i know common parts that would need to be replaced from wear and tear from the ship's turret systems and things like that you would have a gunnery is more a skill of using it to attack and defend less about repair if you wanted to repair your repair stuff could tell you that okay so would it like was it worth me print like printing spare parts for things usually you don't print anything until you need it okay you never know what you're gonna need yeah i mean think no thinking of printing stuff uh we got somebody who's uh likes to build robots and stuff right yeah print parts for robots maybe like little recon drones something like that oh the ship has a good idea um it comes with sorry oh it's not mentioned on there 15 drones that are launchable from from orbit to um atmosphere and so okay the 3d printer i assume takes material how does that how's that measured uh the measure you've got a ton of material in the cargo bay okay and uh depending on how much or what you're wanting to produce you use up so much of it okay yeah so if jack can we do something with garth about using a bit of that stuff to start building some basic robot stuff i was gonna say i reckon i'll get garf as the engineer to start designing a robot frame and working i don't think have any interest or any particular skill set to do that he's got engineering which is starship drive oh unless you want to robot and then jump into space pretty much you just need permission by the engineer to use the resources or by the captain okay you could sell it as a combat droid yeah that's what i was thinking i'll just sort of start that process designing the frame okay yep okay so the first week you're just sitting in your room designing the frame working out how you can make it the most effective the most efficient use the least amount of material until you can get a big lot of material to use to either fashion yourself or print so give me a that'll be a mechanical to start off with because it's a building process yeah and you can apply your intelligence or education bonus if you have one only one of them though or educate no and i couldn't and i wouldn't and what's does what does garth come for mechanical he's got mechanics one so can he help me um only if he's not doing his job remember you guys have got jobs for reasons um yeah okay all right well i'll just talk to him you can show him at the end and see what he says well okay that's one week done and you really haven't got past the resources issue um yeah it's just you can make something but you'd be using up an awful lot of resources you can't get it to be a bit more efficient but you can show your results to garth and see what he can do with them okay oh that's rolled asgarth whoops okay okay yeah so i'll show my results okay towards the end before you go into um come out of jump space give uh give me a mechanics roll from garth please okay oh okay um he grabs out a stylus and he grabs your port comp or whatever comp you've been working off and he you know pulls that off pulls that off pulls it off he says well there's a working skeleton and he's reduced the amount used by around about 60 percent but it is just a skeleton yeah okay yeah that's fine okay so now you just got to get cleared by the captain to use the printer to create it you won't use them an awful lot it'd be probably around about 10 kgs of the um ton yeah okay okay and that's a t o n n e not a t o n yeah so i'll have a so captain you're all good with me starting to make my robot frame yeah why not let's one let's get some more entertainment on the ship right okay all right i can only yeah that might be on someone's to-do list next next habitable planet get some form of entertainment um okay um you're coming out of jump so you don't have any much more time it's taking that long um jack to get to this point you have the okay to start printing when you've got a spare moment all right i'll let everybody else do whatever they want to do first yeah well um i believe remington's just going over his stuff raises checking sensor data garth is just doing whatever he's doing so everyone's doing their bits and then it's coming up you've got about a half hour warning to um prick prep to come out of jump all right so what are you doing to come out of jump guys um i guess i'm i'm going to the pilot uh or not i'm going to the cockpit to help the pilot do do uh his stuff yeah um i tell the engineer to check everything make sure everything's all good ready to rumble yep we're gonna suit some stuff apart because you're going to be doing something else soon aren't you so did i sit before this happened did you what sorry did i set this to print before can i do that no no no there's a huge amount of energy to exchange when you come out of jump you're moving in dimensions so the ship needs all the stuff there you need to be basically setting your gun ready to power up the minute you come out into normal space so i need to do checks as garth don't i um well the captains ask you to do a check on everything yep so that would be an electronics for the power supply unit and starship engineering for the engines so two roles so this is my electronics role okay guy thinks that everything's okay engineering role uh and the engine is a fine captain well i can't it's all these ones i don't know i don't know but you're pretty okay for the first one or two jumps guys your ship's pretty much new um if this had gone into the game a few sessions those numbers might start to be one worrisome because i might be hiding something from you uh good to know yeah um should we maybe yeah yeah we'd like to think about finding another engineer next time we hit port that should be pretty good oh man yeah um okay so you're coming out of jump space jack you're in the turret and the shield will come up once you get into normal space you come through immediately um remington we need a scan roll a computer role please okay that's right nope holy what -3 did i had gum i had i had the uh computer using computers yeah okay that's good that's a better one comms is fixing it is using and fixing but yeah computer will be enough to get you through um okay yeah okay interesting stuff there is no you're not receiving any automated data streams um you're not picking up any other signals you would expect to come across something so early indications suggest to you remington that this is a non-inhabited system okay um can i i guess tell if any planets are around do i need to another sweep yep you'll need to spend a bit more time you can use your um either intelligence or education as a bonus uh if they've got a if they've got a bonus yeah i think yeah got one unintelligent cool so you're spending extra time uh raise you've been just told this that he suspects that this is a non-inhabited system cool um but you're sort of so what are you doing with the ship are you bringing it to a halt until you can work out things yeah i mean so okay so it takes a while because whatever speed you enter jump you exit jump in so be very aware of that okay do you want to kind of just uh because we don't know like in terms of like you know planetary bodies we don't know what's going on yet do we no you haven't got the information you didn't get any anomaly or anything in your jump time so you might want to go over the um sensor records and all sorts of other bits and pieces just to see if you can see what's happened there oh yeah something i could pour over that since i'm sitting and then like what the later date it'll be that you want to sort of work out what's around you so you don't impact on something just at the moment yes yeah so when you're ready make your next computer or uh with the plus one for intelligence hi okay radio um doing and also sort of crawford servants seeing some of your navigational stuff you do pick up um no main bodies but a whole lot of um smaller bodies so after spending seven hours going through all this information um just give me a second gotta get to the right planet right system here we go um you have detected several ring belts you also have detected quite a distance from you though a gas giant which itself seems to possess four ring belts around it so you've got fuel i guess i le we i guess um i go ahead and i i relay the information to the captain in the pilot um okay that's what you can do and you then you might want to switch over and start looking at um other stuff yeah so i'll like while they're doing their thing and like doing their gas scoop i'll just go ahead and look at the the i guess the data from the um the veil yep okay i haven't tried to interpolate that so what are you doing captain um you've got a good sensory reader of the system you know where to avoid what you know roughly where the gas joint is um i guess i'll head towards the gas giant just to get some um okay one or two g go one one g okay so that's going to take you 25 hours to get there so just under a day so what happens is you go you get to what normally happens is you you you go at one g for this round then you go another one g which makes it two g you got another one g it makes your three g and the other one g makes it four g and you just keep on adding it's a vector sort of system then halfway you flip the ship over and you decelerate by one g so that by the time you reach rough orbit area of this of the um planet you're sort of a g that you can control like a zero or one g yeah yeah well above zero it's between zero and one g so okay so i need you to make an easy nav roll please just uh 2d6 plus zero i think it is for you and if you have a bonus on your i'm going to say education you can edit four it's just what you need it wasn't a hard roll but good god you made it hard okay so you have plotted a course you start taking the ship in that direction yeah yeah okay no piling rule needed because you've plotted the course you know all the data so it's going to take you just over a day but at least you've got stuff to look at jack you're staring at space stars it's all rather boring nothing to shoot out here um do you the captain's done a pretty good job you can sort of bring up your sort of trajectory and all that sort of stuff and roughly where things are so you know roughly when you get close to something you might want to be sitting in the turret just in case you want to play let's shoot the rock that passes by us or something yeah okay so you've got a several hours before that even happens um seven hours um remington make your computer roll and you've got no bonus to your education is that right perry i met uh yep sorry i was muted uh yes no i'm eight so that's no bonus okay give me a roll please see what you get five god damn it okay um there's a couple of energy signals that you can't oh that's a double two add the point one to your computer roll how do i get a double with just five because you got two two twos plus the bonus of one i thought we were i wasn't doing a bonus and don't forget just to write it somewhere in your notes that you've got a point one added to your computer skill you betcha because you've got a double there okay radio so i mean that their stuff will be taken care of in the background as we get to know these systems anyway um what you've got from your time at the computer and trying to look at different energy signatures look at different things um there is a definite period it was about 40 seconds around about on let's say day 2.7 um there's 40 seconds where the energy readings were not consistent anymore with background so background energy readings of what is whatever that is jump space was different but you're not sure what that means you just know there was a um about a 40 second difference okay not much i can do i guess but just log the information yep yep and and until you can pick up something else yeah okay so you've got the rest of apprentice today jack you get up into your cockpit you're gunning cycle looking up there's nothing within range the captain's keeping it nice and safe good but your fingers are bit itchy um wanted to pull those triggers seeing what this thing can do um so yeah um well if like if i'm if i'm 100 i'm very confident that nothing's coming up can i just start my skeleton printing yeah at the moment you could you you don't have much in the way of energy drain on your ship yeah so once that that happens you go back in and then start printing off so you input your stuff and the stuff that garth sort of gave you pull out the raw data put it into the print machine and you start printing it so what you're left with is [Music] basically it looks like a little servery table um it has four straight legs it has wheels at the bottom which is where it's going to be motivated they'll be electronic motorized wheels which you can send down the circuitry down the leg or print it on the leg if you want to to power them you have a small round about a foot round um shelf table like structure at the top which is going to hold um the cpu the sensor base the weapon base the honor like a pivot um yeah sort of thing at the moment it's a very basic little machine but um that's sort of what you've got in mind at the moment that's the smallest you get to so you're basically building the locomotion part of the vessel you still have to work out how you want to power this thing okay batteries would be great but that consumes quite a bit of resources because you've got to change the raw material into different metals so you might want to try to gain those elsewhere if you were going to go a small nuclear pack um you'd have to get permission to actually build one of those because obviously in a fight should it get hit and should they actually yeah the shielding that you have to make on it could be quite dangerous oh hold on i'm thinking uh that might be a good thing right let's uh go ahead and make us a little uh suicide drone like a little uh i mean wouldn't you think though we got a group of enemies we can just you know poke a hole in the ready uh the shielding and just send it on down yeah over overload the reactor throw it into a bunch of enemies yeah right so contrary to popular belief overloading the reactor doesn't make it explode well maybe not over no no not ovary uh not overloaded but radiation everything they get a massive dose of radiation they're gonna feel pretty sick and they're not gonna wanna fight anymore that's okay so just a point to remington that breaks so many war conventions oh we're out there no we're out here in unknown space we don't know anything about that but you do know that raise your captain is recording as much as he possibly can okay so i guess i bite my dog no i don't know you might want to suggest it quietly to check no no no well i don't know about that because you'd have to permission to record them if they're somewhere like in their own room or something that's still sacrosanct but like women do not know you might suggest that to check quietly in in the room somewhere and say have you ever thought of like having something that could like let the radiation out and da da da da so you could have that talk but it's up to jack because i mean yeah jack's got to get work out what power system is going to be best and how to um regenerate the power what does he want on the ship on the vest the device as a um offensive material what sort of shielding it's got lots of questions to ask himself he's all he's got is a pair of working legs eventually that's it at the moment he's got a little remote control zone drone and he might even yeah he might even want batteries instead so that's maybe a conversation for a later date yeah but batteries can be rigged to blow up i like this i like rigging things to blow up idea don't you have demolitions as a skill no no i've got it okay now we know remington's the light and blinding one of those toilet things and say make it a garlic yeah put a vest from swordfish there you go there you go okay radio so um has anyone thought to capture any astrological data of the system they're in i have thought i thought of that you know i just i was it just now occurred to me um should i make a rule for that yep no that's you just you just turn it basically on you just got to think of these things that's all it doesn't require anything you're just going to grab as much astronomical data as you can dump it into the library data so you've got something to refer to later on okay i flipped the switch and you know start learning drums for the way home eventually you go through a night cycle you're awake you are approaching the gas giant this gas giant is a sort of a yellowy greeny color which would indicate probably sulfur [Music] probably some ammonia so you want to be careful going into it now we need rays to make a piloting role to basically take the ship in open up the vents and start gathering gas now do you want to spend the time it'll take you five days that's five days worth of and you got to keep track of air support our life support but do you want to spend the five days in gathering and refueling with refined fuel or just gathering and just taking off with unrefined fuel um i will spend the time because we have it um okay yeah i'll spend the five days good morning okay so that means it's going to take a couple of parting roles you're just being really safe which is a good call at the moment so can you give me your first piling rule please 11. beautifully done not a double no no okay so the first one he comes in he sucks everything up and he comes back out exits really lovely the um garth you can start turning the pumps over and you you're in the first day you've created your first five ton of refined fuel the ship i think requires 24 tonne um of refined fuel so but some of that sorry you've only used um the 20 tonne in the jump so you've only got to replace 20 tonne plus the fuel you'll need to replace another ton to replace the fuel that you've been using to power the ship to do all of this so possible would it be possible you know for me to kind of just siphon off a little bit of this fuel you know so i can make some i don't know a little handheld explosives are you asking me i'm asking the dm if that's something i can do as a demolitions guy it's a possibility because you've got to read well sulfur would be a really good one ammonium as a gas grenade bomb thing would be quite horrible again it it crosses so many conventions no i don't i'm not okay so i don't really ask and looking at how the captain's got to do this he's going to have to take a fifth day to get that one ton um so he's probably going to have extra on that last day okay yeah i'd love if i can kind of surreptitiously you know siphon some of that uh fuel off i'd like to go ahead and take some and try to make a couple of little compressors put it put in a little the remote castle possibly yep okay and hide it somewhere in your state room yeah okay well we'll see if that can happen but first of all um back to the second day the arrays diving in getting some more gas eight okay oh this is close oh hold on uh no because no it's added an additional plus two so it's actually six well that's okay you've got a problem with plus two you know but it's added an additional plus two on top of it so it's added two plus two plus two plus two oh so it's a six yeah okay this is where garth gets grouchy you manage to get the fuel and start the process but you've scratched up the hull you have had particulate impact on the hull your hull doesn't have any armor so any damage must it is best that it is repaired as soon as possible i want to go ahead and go through the uh like the uh the sensors and see if anything's like critical has been damaged okay make you roll please that's going to be computers correct yep yep all righty uh uh intelligence modifier or just um this would have to be intelligence because you don't have full understanding of the ship so you're going to apply your intelligence so that's not an education you're not trained in the ship stuff gotcha okay yep nice um is it a double yeah well that's point two already uh oh he's getting lots of experience um having a look over everything no primary secondary or two three systems are damaged it is it has pitted some of the external hull that can be you can just take a small amount of the material print it off and then um weld the plate on to that area to keep it protected that will require you to go out on a space walk and use your mechanics to do that you have zero i would do that wouldn't i yep garth wood zero g what zero or one oh goth okay uh he's got uh who's got the better zero g n mechanic because it's mechanical zero g1 and i have zero i i thought i had zero g4 uh i don't have zero g i'm zero g minus one and garth's plus one ah yeah cause yours is your jack of all trades yeah yeah okay all right so garth would do that okay radio so he's gonna go out there i'm not gonna complicate matters by making him do a zero g roll because there's nothing dangerous out there he's just got to get the plate put it out and weld it on so give me a mechanic roll please okay here we go you can not get a negative one do i get um i just do a modifier of zero right it's a 2d6 plus whatever skill level is here yeah okay eight was it a double it wasn't okay but it's all squared away he's happy with that um he's not worried about the ship going into an atmosphere or anything comes back in reports will clear third day where you go captain next dive what you've noticed is that um five oh god okay he's putting up the hull which means garth's got to go out there and do it again okay but that's okay because low numbers mean i'm going to get high numbers soon we hope so do another roll oh yeah awesome work okay he comes in after the third day um fourth day seven you're fine because you actually need less than an eight um but no scratching up cool garth is very happy he doesn't have to get into a spacesuit get out there and yeah look at the yawning mouth of a guest giant that's trying to pull him into his death and crush him mercilessly in the depths of the high pressure yeah um that's always a danger when you're around a gas giant ah so last day you're diving in to get a little bit not too much okay over and get as much as you need okay i'm going to ask a certain surgeon on board ship are you actioning your plan uh yes i just want to um kind of gather and compress a small amount of the this fuel okay well it won't be fuel um because that's the fuel plant you'll get the gas itself yeah because it works off hydrogen the fuel so you're only putting water into it you're using the raw elements okay so um so you're gonna have to give me a mechanic roll okay to do it and then if you want to cover your tracks a computer role to change slightly the sensor data yeah mechanic  okay you couldn't do it um but double ones you've learnt from experience what do you know there you go oh do you get it do you still get it from double ones yeah because i think it's double and further up i did get double one originally it was just double sixes i'm trying to see how it goes i didn't realize we're going to get so many doubles i might change that later on but for the moment any doubles counts although i'm a bit worried did not have doubles that have been thrown anyway i got a double one for rolled engineering i got two cool so are you trying to use the computer just to cover up your sense of uh sensor data that you tried to do this remington met so i keep forgetting that i'm on push to talk that's uh yeah okay computer submit and that's an eight as far as you're concerned there's been no no one's tried anything totally fine next time next time yeah and of course by the time that there's a next time you might have been able to get and create some gear that might make it a bit more easier okay yeah okay radio so you're fueled you have used um two days one week five days seven seven you've used 14 days of life support yeah i've got that here yeah so you've got another four weeks okay before you need to really panic and say oh we're going to dive asphyxiation so how fast you want to get out to your jump point from the jet gas giant um i would we'll go to the 1g um and just kind of take the time and see if there's anything else up there okay rodeo can i get remington to give me a sensory suite please you got a computer plus one for intelligence still right and there you go that's a fool 14 damn did i do that right i got double sixes oh my goodness that works for me okay [Music] people are thinking of backing the surgeon it's just too lucky anyway um what happens is that you do your last sweep your every piece of data you've gathered on this place still confirms that it's an uninhabited zone you haven't picked up anything that would be out of the ordinary about that and everything seems to be secure and safe on the vet you're carrying carrying carrying onto to make the jump to the next place but what you want to do now because it's a jump away one jump away this is where the two of you in the cockpit can support each other so um if remington can do an aid for razer's nav to see if there's a gas giant present in 0710 okay what kind of role would just regular that's a nerf roll which is never zero i think for you i don't have any net so that'd be minus three no no zero because you've got pilot remember pilot never this um similar just yeah that just got a zero on it because it's not your primary okay nope no help there okay right here raise he got doubles again what the hell doubles wow i'm thinking that this doubles for everything might stop after tonight's one i've rolled so many i've only got two don't let me don't let me roll don't let me ruin it for everybody else well yeah we've got one at least um okay radio so going into it we're all good to go no you've got to make a role to see your party you're never all please raise perfect you do detect there are multiple [Music] says steve before he actually looks at the entry hang on a second yes you do detect that there are multiple gas joints in that system you will definitely have fuel at least we'll be jumping too sorry 0.70710 okay so where do we get life support from um other races that have technological stuff otherwise you have to gather it you would land on a planet that's got a compatible um atmosphere to resupply that you'd be able to gather food and store it somehow so it doesn't go off you'd be doing that from like planet to planet um you do have some refrigeration stuff but most of your stuff is pre-packed stuff um water on board a ship hardly ever has to be bought it's it's topped up every month or two because all the water in the ship is recycled so your urine everything's recycled drinking water and whatever so um just to give you an example um basically this system that you're jumping out of needs a name and i've just labeled it lux lux as in light yeah i'm i like the landlord because that's about the only thing that is in the system is light so if we were looking at a an entry so if anyone's going to keep an entry of the system okay this is what the entry would look like okay and i'll read this to you so you know what it is okay lux is the name of the sister the system it's in the hex 0809 it has x no star port so the other three six numbers are the first three numbers the physicality of the planet so it's size 0 there's no actual major planet that's habitable so it's all ring systems asteroid systems because of that there is no atmosphere it's a zero because of that there's no hydrographic levels which is a zero there are no people in the system so that's the fourth zero because there's no people there's no government system which is the fifth zero because there are no people in the sixth thing there is no law level and lastly the other zero is the tech level there is no tech in here apart from what you fly in which is a zero and there is a g for gas giant present that's how you'd read that system so if you want to start keeping track of that and um when i set up the page on eight plus so um i'll invite you to that to match if you want to to you can look at all the other games and that there will be a place where um i'll eventually get it so that you can actually add your entries to that particular part and tell your sort of story from remington's sort of viewpoint you know i have gleefully now made five of my i don't know melting bombs or something whatever you do with ammonia acid or something sulfuric acid what have you created in these little lovely things yeah five liters i'm perturbed raised last time i checked he had two arms now he's got three where did he get the extra one that sort of stuff yeah why has he got tentacles coming out of his head um but anyway um talk a bit more about that later on um so that's how if you want to keep record that's how you do it and i'll help you with the numbers and stuff as you get so you get familiar with what the numbers mean but in this case it all means there's absolutely nothing here except for a gas giant and the star yeah so you have detected on 0710 gas giant so you know there's a g at the end of this description and at multiple gas giants so that's good that means it's um the possibility of if it's got at least two guest giants it's got possibility of having more planets so you go through your system of navigation plot by the pilot and this is where you can aid the pilot should you wish to remember so like yeah okay make your piling roll first to see if you can ate them good nine okay you get a plus one from the a that remington is giving you you need to make your plotting your jump raise let's go another pardon roll with plus one of his nicely done okay so you've got all that lined in you are not using unrefined fuel so first of all you get your travel out which is about 17 hours to the jump point which is nice and easy um and then well i just could look up those bonuses again penalties for jumping um so the can i get the engineer to give me a 2d6 plus engineering yep i think i know what you need to engage the oil engines and make sure everything's cool done beautifully is that a double no okay already okay um you get the green light from uh gareth rays all good to go ready and this time his voice seems to carry a bit of conviction with it i'm very confident very confident yeah and you make the role to jump in the jump space i'm so be okay rodeo when you jump in what are you going for gas giant area life habitable life zone area um i will go for gas giant because i know we've got a couple of weeks left of life support but i think our next stop will be for life support okay radio so it's a weak spin and jump um anyone doing anything did um do remington want to go back to the data that he got from the jump across the veil or do you want to interpret any other data or did he want to start working on his little how can i siphon off some gas and weaponize it and if you are talking we're not hearing you matt god damn it my bad very good yeah um i'm gonna go ahead and um go back to go back to data to see if there's anything more i can gain from sensors data okay um so that's the whole week you're doing that um mr skye jack jack is gonna start looking into um he's done the locomotion systems yeah so he's gonna look at um so he's done is he done all the power to that or is it just just motors and wheels at the moment at the moment he's powering it off a remote control device sort of thing okay beaming some energy to it he hasn't just checked that it can move and hasn't so he's gonna yeah so he's gonna start designing the sensors for um judging distances and okay um visual awareness vision systems and things like that just to know all the navigational type is it going to be camera vision is it going to be thermal vision is it going to be infra vision what sort of vision systems are you wanting to put in place on it it's going to be what's improvision infra vision is um in done in low light it detects heat you've also got low light vision you've got thermal vision which is another it's much more refined than infra vision improvision would be cheaper and less costly cheaper and easier to make but it's not as refined as thermal vision oh yeah thermal vision okay thermal vision and ordinary camera facial recognition stuff yeah yeah okay radio so that's relatively easy because you can pull some of that from the computer and it would just be miniaturizing it and setting it up so um make a i think you this one would be more an electronic roll and just make it and it's going to be a much easier roll to get so yeah it's going to be heaps easy hopefully uh i got a line cool no double oh always check for the double um okay so yeah you got something that would be compatible that's not using too much um you are going to i mean the more stuff you put on this thing the bigger the power unit is going to have to be yeah i mean that's your requirement anyway um so are you wanting 360 vision are you wanting four people no no just just just binocular binocular human do like standard front vision but i'd have that rotation like rt rotate rotation well that'll be more on the um the gimbal the thing that moves it around yeah okay right so it's just bipedal um bipedal um normal human vision basically yeah basically okay right so you need to make sure that captain's okay for you to take that because you're gonna take it a little bit extra because you need to change it to several different substances um yeah but as long as he's okay with that he's already giving you permission that should just proceed hey captain captain look what i've done i've designed the the vision system for my for my uh for my autonomous robot i really need to send this to the printer and get it started right away what's wrong with my vision this is an autonomous rover it's here to protect us are there any any any explosives on it not yet but we can happen to it and then and then maybe you can talk about uh now i've got i've got a method i've worked out a method with garth and i've discussed it with him this is the the plan of attacks we're gonna work on the the the critical systems first and then and then go on to the workplaces let me let me know when you want me to put a bomb on it oh definitely because it's definitely gonna do that i don't really know if we wanna we need to get there so we just this is this beginning stage this beginning stage and at the moment the only place that could really do well in this protect the inside of the ship um yeah that's right unless you're going into a flat place this thing could protect us while we're sleeping yeah i think and how come how come you how come it's on wheels why don't you have like a maybe you should put some wings on it or like maybe a couple of rotors maybe turn it into a helicopter that's a that's a good one that's a good uh thing it's a good option for version two yeah i don't i don't wanna i don't wanna waste the resources that i've already used version two you wanna grab unit on it yeah yeah that's that's what we're going for that's that's the that's the aim but at the moment we're just going to start with the basics hey do you think that thing could like you could hook up like a little uh grappler arm in the welder or something that can you know that's a good idea and then we could send it outside and garth doesn't have to do the repairing when the captain smashes into things [Laughter] sorry dean i'm not smashed into anything so uh are you giving permission to proceed with the next step um with the eyes yeah yep okay good cool okay right they're just printing off um you don't need to roll anything they'll just be made in the rest of the week that you're in jump um can remington give me a um i'm just trying to think what would be the best role here not really using his skill okay so garth might be able to support remington with his sense of stuff about the void because garth has studied in starship engineering right so he understands the sort of physics behind all that sort of pallava so taking that data to him might be beneficial if garth can make a role to then let you have a bonus from his role yes okay okay well so i guess i went ahead and i yeah go ahead because it's just at the moment you've tried just your version of trying to interpret the raw data with computer skill didn't work so now you need to start looking at different avenues what else yeah i just like i go ahead and i take uh the data to to garth um and you know i show it to him when i say like a what the the is going on here i can't i can't wrap my head around it okay garth give them uh give them a roll versus um engineering yeah all right here let me let me take a look at okay no no but it gives you a plus two on your next roll because it's a 12. and that's going to be so it's um yeah that's what you're using computers plus two you said right and and your computer school yeah eleven nice okay um from your data what garth has had done he's able to produce a 3d representation of the field [Music] and so he sort of shows you a little mock-up model on the omnicomp what it looks like normally when you're going through it's a like a shell it's like a cocoon that's based and it's around about up to about three four meters away from the actual hull of the ship yeah what you see any twit like he twists and he turns the whole thing so you can see that normally that's about everywhere what when you've gone through the whatever it was you went through it it warped the feel the shell around your ship so it sort of pushed everything near the front really really close to the hull so it would have only been about a um a foot away from the hull but weirdly enough it expanded like the last five feet of the hull the back part of the hull and like it really ballooned out there through like streamlined it it's like you know if you make a circle with your finger you think your pointing finger in your thumb and if you were to draw something through that it sort of gets narrow but it bulks up at the back of it sort of that effect um still not sure what it is but you've you've definitely got now a physics effect um to look at and explore a bit more on something okay everybody so anybody um anybody here have uh any science science skill science okay psychology remember that's your number one all the others are zero oh yeah okay yeah i can do a science check yeah yeah okay so i bring up bring all this to him in the uh yeah okay okay and do you have okay are you gonna either employ your intelligence or your wisdom as the bonus stat um i don't i don't get any bonuses okay but so you can choose whichever one but doesn't matter it's just you know just how you want to know which is not the lowest um i'll go [Music] which one did you say intelligence or education because those were the states that would apply to this i'll i'll apply education okay yep make your role okay you're not sure what's going on but you have a a working theory because of the multiplier on your on your jump engine it might have been stronger than previous models if that field had collapsed or come in contact with the hull the field would have collapsed and the ship would have imploded in jump space okay so i'm thinking like maybe you know it seems to me like you know we're moving along you know kind of through through jump space and then like we hit like i don't know some something something like thicker like we're moving from air to water and like suddenly it's harder to get through it and that's why like the uh the front is kind of front of the shell is kind of you know like kind of condensing and the the rear is elongating yep so maybe so you've got a working theory there yeah what creates that and how you manipulate that is further steps to look at but the other part of the working theory is because your drive is just fortified with the new multiplier that's probably what saved you because none of the other ships you're the first multiplier jump to go through here well you well you've never heard back yeah and you know you're alive so this is your working theory until something else proves it either right or wrong how long would it take if we um sent a like a message back to you know where we started how long would it take you know wow assuming they replied immediately two light years away something like i think that's 40 years to send it there in 40 years if it was traveling at the speed of light oh no not um if it could get to the maximum speed no it's not it's more than 40 years so it doesn't travel at the speed of light nope nope nope communication travels at the speed of jump okay yeah so everything's always a year a week later okay yeah makes for interesting things that happen in the game well i guess i mean we're not going to hear from them until we go back then we could send ourselves a letter to get in 40 years yeah but you're only going to be here for a year six months and six months out no i mean like back to the um where we came from terminus yeah okay but i have to work out how long it's going to take it's going to be much more than 40 years i have to work out how long radio signals and then of course there'll be decay oh yeah you are talking about two light years a good point yeah that's a distance and a half and that that's providing there is empty space in between because you might have something in the middle that's to do with that you've got the v you've got to pass through the veil and you're still not quite understanding the full impact or the full mechanics behind it about what it is so your radio signal might hit that and then it just might dissipate we can still see like the uh the stars easy easy to see yep so it's not affecting light so we couldn't like shine a like a like a bright ass laser towards them and start talking to them in binary and maybe get like a two-year message i don't know yeah i guess yeah and do we want people to know that we're here well you do kind of well we want to oh yeah that's right we got we got new contracts right yeah we've got an education one so i'm dealing with all the like obstacles right and i'm looking for like um you know people like trade people to trade with that business business deals yep yeah and there's about jack of that right now i guess so at the moment what are we so what are we doing now i think we've done all we can do with the punch or the defenders are we going to refuel well you got to get out of jump first if you're still in jump space right so is raised doing anything is anyone else on board doing anything else i know what jack and remington are doing no i'm just i don't know like i might pot her off and look at their weird legs and eyes and okay i don't even know what i would do read a book okay watch that safety video again but this time in reverse or you do it in like half speed you just start mucking with it or something okay so um you come down the point where you've got your half half hour warning sign kill until everyone get ready like cool we're good to go like check the engines i feel like i've repeated myself all the time but safety first guys right yeah so um render the cockpit with the pilot and help him to do his thing yeah is everyone doing just that um vex suits i tell everyone put event suits on yeah i don't know how many times i need to remind you if you die oh wow yeah i'll be really angry but i'll take your shear of the money um yeah well you're not quite sure whether human is is nourishment to a hoend um but i guess we'll find out um okay you can decompress your ship um you jacks in his little pew pew station hoping to pew pew um you're coming in on one of the guest giants you hope or in the gas giant zone um i think garth's been asked to make another um engineering check just to see where things are first yeah nice everything looks reasonably good yeah all i've checked everything out everything looks okay sounding quite relaxed okay so boom you shift from jump to normal space okay remington seeing if you're looking up anything yep computers click eight okay um you are picking up signal it's faint it is coming from in system so you'll definitely be able to eventually triangulate and and narrow in it once you head in system um but you are around about 15 hours at one g from a small gas giant so he's placed you perfectly can i use my computer role and see if i can maybe try and detect a stronger signal a what sorry a stronger signal yeah what do you mean by stronger well you know how what does okay i don't know do i die like you know how you said he gets a faint signal is actually wrong or is it because that's what's there that's you have to work that out if you want to roll to see if you can pick up a stronger signal you can do that um if you want to just leave it as it is because it could be a physics thing um things he could he could wait like an hour right um and then you know make another roll and kind of the difference in distance could kind of give us a better idea of which direction that signal is coming from yeah yeah okay so you you'd wait a bit more than an hour because you need to travel significant distance so perhaps halfway in your 15 hours to get to the gas giant um you make another roll no but i got double ones yeah yeah there you go okay alrighty on you don't pick up anything add that to your 0.1 there you go um what you are also doing um i forgot to tell you sorry remington is that you would just flip the switch to try to send signal through the computer to see if it's a communication of any sort to try to decipher try to translate all those sort of things while you're waiting okay yeah so that's been running since you got the first signal forgot to tell you about that sorry okay um because otherwise you know it's not assumed that people are going to talk your language so that's running in the background um you just have a look at that like halfway through and oh yes what it can decipher is yes it does seem to be some language and the computer is building up a language base so it's looking for repetitions it's looking for certain things so it hasn't worked it all out yet but it would suggest that there is intelligent life in this system does a i mean if they're like any kind of like you know phrases or words that can pick out does it seem hostile yet no um there is you notice there is a another carrier wave that is carrying a second signal um different to the first more obvious one so if you want to play around with the computer school to see if you can work out what that's about yeah okay yeah i want to go ahead and investigate that one a little bit further make your role it's a video signal but it's a very it's like going through your database this is sort of an like your systems send it all on what we call the unibeam so video audio all goes through one line yeah it's all compacted into one packet this one's using two different frequency bases so you recognize as a video sync signal so you're trying to clear it up so this is going to take a bit of a while so we're going to move over to the captain making the dive into the ship into the planet into the gas giant first look at nine five yep that's five ton of fuel okay next day you can have another um computer roll um you check on the language it's still working on the language but it seems to have worked out some of the alphabet gotcha so one more time assuming we're on the next day already yep ah six okay um nothing further on the language you have been able to compile as much as possible um of the video signal you it's really hard to tell it's degraded quite a lot so they two things sort of become obvious one is that these signals are not very powerful so they weren't intended to travel great distances um so the other one it looks like some it's really hard to make out you you can see some moving sort of figures more than a couple um they kind of give you the you sort of look at them you kind of think are they floating in space did they not have grav tech oh so you're not quite sure you're gonna have to try to tidy up the picture again i'd like to um talk to uh who was who was saying they also had a computer skill hey i'd like to know talk to talk to resin um ask him like if he might want to you know kind of help me out on the comms and maybe see if we can kind of triangulate sort of like a direction for help that that'll happen on the way in because you you are aimed at the gas joint at the moment which won't give you any triangulation you're gonna have to move through the system to triangulate well we could kind of compare that to uh the first signal we got correctly we just came out of travel okay so we've got two samples we need one more yep okay that's all i got for today cool okay um so jack you've been pretty quiet you've um sort of worked out the eyes of your little operation what are you moving on to next i'm gonna do i'm gonna add i'm gonna add i'm going to try and do um like an ai compute module in the cpu to see if it can learn on its own so you can sort of like i can press the go button and it'll map out the ship and and find all the nooks and crannies and it should drive itself around okay so first thing first you don't have the tech level experience or equipment to make ai you do have the tech level um to do what you just described it can move around by accident and basically yeah that's fine i'm happy with that okay so do you have computing i have computing minus one that's what you're going to try to use can i get one of the guys they are a bit busy with their stuff at the moment they're busy i got a six no not quite um you are um so you've grabbed a couple of the spare things that are on board ship just some basic ic units icu units and stuff and some ram some you grabbed a small solid state crystal um because it's all crystal um recording things um you've built the the holster and all that sort of stuff for that you've mounted that on um you still haven't got a power unit so you can't actually do anything but you're building that um but that's as far as you've got in the time that you've been spending so it's slowly being developed now it looks kind of like um a bowl on a table is what you're getting at the moment yeah okay yep okay that stands about three foot tall and the bowl's around about another eight inches yeah it's got some pieces around the rim okay and a sort of screwed up head okay the third day captain third day i'd like to you know make another roll and uh yeah i'll just get him to do the okay and just about scraped the engine oh it's great to scrape the ship okay radio once the captain's done that you too can make your captain can help you with a computer roll to see if you can fix up the video file i got an eight plus one plus one seven yeah so that's an eight right okay you do clear it up so give me a second i will now show you so these beings because there's about four or five of them you can see in the um in the in the video they appear to be in some sort of chamber and they appear to be floating so your suspect suspicion is something like um a space station an orbital space station or something of that kind is what sort of is suggested to you still working on the language still working on the syntaxes and stuff um but they're talking um looking finding i think this is it now i'm just going to find it sorry just give me a second so what you have to apply to this is a whole lot of fur but basically if i can load it into roll20 if it lets me is doing that now guys you'll see the picture of them very shortly basically what you're seeing a rather tall thin bipedal which can only be described as because they these are fury um tall bipedal fury llama-like creatures that's what you see on the screen and they're talking they have some very very basic spacesuit type of thing on them of course their helmets are completely different designed to your helmets um yeah they seem to be quite animated um if you're reading the facial expressions correctly they seem to be smiling and the odd noise could could possibly be described as laughing not quite sure um but you don't know any of your social customs or anything but raise you've got a piece of the video now once you can tie that up with the translating device you might be able to apply some of your social sciences to start working out what might be a way to approach these creatures but it is suggestive that they have at least attained space flight at least to an orbital sense is what you're sort of seeing okay yeah you haven't got anything to to confirm that but that's sort of the suggestion at the moment um as i said the computer is working on syntax so it's sort of so it's working on a 36 uh symbol alphabet um there are a couple of sounds that you sort of practice because they're just not natural to humans all sorts of weird stuff but you have liaison so you're the person to make first contact when this happens so you've got the layers on skill raises trying to work out from a sociological point of view what might be the best way to approach these creatures and that's a couple of days off because we both have liaison can we approach them together no yeah yes you can but the one with the best liaison is the one that does the work that's one thing you can't aid a person on because it's an interactive skill yeah okay uh sorry the only director skill you can aid somebody on is intimidate okay yeah because i guess we should um kind of wait and wait for the uh the computer to kind of break down more of the alphabet yep well you've got a couple more days yet he's got two more rolls uh one more roll to for the next day to get the final lot of fuel so last roll please raise beautifully done okay you've got your fuel you can plot your okay another sensor sweep please so you can sort of get a better okay you've got a bit of a direction in the way to head um can we have a navigation role please raise nine cool so you know how to dodge you've plotted it around various there are planetary bodies that you have a rough idea of where are so you've plotted around that you've picked up some outer asteroid rings so you know how to work through that the other thing you notice and i'm assuming that someone's clicked on the put this in the library data is that this like you know how most um systems have a plane that the planets are on this system has three planes okay so it's kind of chaotic out there um the the three planes yeah as you go in you're going to find out more um it's going to require a bit of finesse it's definitely going to require jack in the gunnery thing because he's probably going to encounter some bits and pieces he's going to have to blow out of the sky to keep you safe so yeah knowing that you're just going to have to go so it would be traveling at 1g while not perhaps the best it does give you time but it's the safest way to go so that would be i'm making the suggestion now but i'm going to give you facts you guys interpret that and decide later on but just because this is the first time so you're looking at close to six days to get into the origin point of the signal okay does anybody have um any any linguistic skills no um you too with computers would have the closest because you've got the computer to help you work with that okay so the linguistics i guess that's yeah but that's okay because you've got you take your once once it's corrected you would take your omnicomp with you and it would translate between the two races so my my linguistic skill will be minus one instead of minus three for you because i've got jack of all trades yeah okay um so there's but there's nothing like we can do to help it along then i guess just gonna have to wait on the computer yeah just like it's a computing power trying to ascertain what the syntaxes are and all that sort of stuff um i'll use my psych skill to try and figure out like body language and stuff yep okay so you're going to spend the next couple of days apart from pilot would be best now while you're not near any rings or planets or things that you have to be really conscious of dodging i mean it's not gonna be that that easy but you know just yeah so like i look for things like if they made a certain sound if there was uh like a hand gesture or something all that sort of stuff totally cool okay give me your psychological role please 12 10 10 good enough okay yeah you're starting to understand these creatures they they there's many similarities between them and what's what is social in human sphere terms um you're still not sure which ones if they actually have two different genders or the same gender or they have three or four genders there's nothing obvious at the moment about that some of them have different coloration definitely when remington looks at the computer data there is definitely different modulation frequencies some speak in a slightly higher tone than others and they do tend to be um of different coloration you don't know whether that's a gender thing or this that's like a cast thing or what you don't have the full knowledge to know that but you've noticed these differences um they seem to have whatever it is for them a sense of humor because you sort of the body language and the strange noise and the things they do after whatever interaction they have to you indicate that they their version of laughing um yeah and they seem that there seems to be two different sorts of communication going on there's one sort where it's more relaxed and one sort where it's not relaxed you can tell the difference in the voice and the the um facial features and the and yeah so one is more formal one is more informal yeah kind of yeah is this on the loop is the the recording on the loop is it no it's just on a loop at the moment because that's the only one you've you've cleared up okay and you can pick up normal stuff if you want so i can obviously tell there are there's more than one person like oh yeah you can see at least four different individuals and i can kind of can i maybe like make out which ones are relaxed and which ones are more each one of them will go through um they usually do this more or this less relaxed talk first and then it sort of changes into more relaxed talk okay yeah the the closest thing that i could suggest to you that might make sense is like when you have to give a report and you get that out of the way then things get a little bit more easy breezy okay that sort of suggests that to you possibly just like a quirk of the language or the other it could be it could be that they have like a very formal way of introducing things and then they get into the more personal stuff yeah yeah yeah okay i don't think there's anything i can at the moment at the moment no that's okay you're just heading in okay guys so you're heading in and that's where i'm going to call the game tonight so i'm just going to stop the recording", "CFx4XaDfYg8": "since I am such a Plex fanboy I periodically do things like check the Plex forms or browse the Plex or reddit and during these browsing zuv mine I sometimes stumble upon little things that I find interesting with Plex it could be a small tweak or a feature exposure that I just think hey that's cool but I always think to myself is that really something to make a dedicated video about and a lot of the times the answer's no so in today's video I introduce a new series called Plex hacks Plex hacks Plex hacks Plex hacks neat Plex stuff what's up YouTube Jason here with byte my bits I kind of stumbled through that intro because I'm not entirely sure what I want to call this a little miniature series I've come up with Plex hacks but you know you say it really quick together it's just Plex hacks it sounds a little weird Plex hacks Plex tips neat Plex I don't know whatever I ended up calling this little miniature series of mine basically the point is I want to make small short little tip videos of neat things that you might be able to do with Plex which could entitle modifying certain things with Plex or just exposing you know certain features that you might not use so to get on with the video today I'm going to talk about cinema trailers with a custom pre-roll basically I was browsing reddit tonight and right at the top was you know some user who decided to create a Netflix style pre-roll that he can play in front of his movies this is a pre-roll that will play in front of every movie that he watches which I know it could possibly get old after time but it could also be cool and I'll have his name in front of me but I will definitely leave all the links in the description to what I am doing today but either way what he created was pretty cool he even had a youtube preview again links in the description and I just thought what he did was awesome and I ended up actually putting it on my server so I wanted to share that with you let me show you how it works so the first thing you're going to want to do is follow the links that I provide below go to the reddit post and you can download the mp4 file keep in mind that I am making this video demonstrating the use of this specific pre-roll that's in the specific reddit post ultimately you can use the pre-roll of your choice but in today's video I'm using this video file but like I said download the mp4 file and from here you want to put it somewhere on your server that Plex has access to however unless you are going to be manually excluding this with the Plex library scans you don't want to put it in a media folder or a media library folder where Plex will try to read it as a TV show or a movie so in my example I have a root folder that has folders for all of my different types of media so all they did was paste this pre-roll video in that root folder so Plex automatically will not scan this video file and try to identify and add it to any library then all you have to do is go into the Plex settings then go into your server settings go down to the bottom and you'll see the option for extras on the left-hand side click on that and you'll see cinema pre-rolls make sure that this is unable to play before a movie and then in this box right here you want to put the exact location to where the video file is that you want to use as a pre-roll now I did cheat a little bit since I run this off unrated and the path can be a little complicated to at least memorize off the top of your head all I did was edit one of my libraries and I edited the path that was already included in the library to add the media file location to where I know exactly where that root folder is without having to you know type it all out manually so I did that I copied that then I cancelled out of that editing I pasted that into the extras box for the cinema trailers and I clicked save and from your server settings standpoint right now you are technically done however there's one minor I would say a flaw but I kind of understand there's one minor thing that you have to do in order to get your players to actually play this pre-roll before each movie and to keep things simple here I will show you what it's like to set this up for the web player through the Plex interface online so I go back into the settings go down to the player and right here you have an option for playing those pre roles and you can even specify how many to do of course this is where you can set it up to play trailers you know for movies that you might not seen but for me I'm just going to enable it to play one and in this case that one is going to be that pre-roll that I've already predefined once you make that change every time you watch a movie with the web interface here it will automatically play the pre-roll that you just defined so just to show you what it looks like I went into a movie that I have on my plex media server I clicked on play and there you go it automatically played that pre-roll that I defined right before the movie I even went back and tested it a few times and every time I click play that little Plex Netflix spin-off thing popped up each time so circling back in order to get this to work on other players you will have to manually go into the settings for each one and enable it to play those pre-roll trailers if you don't do that you won't see it pop up well that's it for today guys I just wanted to make that very simple hopefully a very short video showcasing a neat little feature that you can do to customize Plex I do want to give a shout out to the reddit user who created that custom little Netflix spin-off intro for videos I plan on using that for a long time so guys let me know what you think about this little miniature series showcasing small little Plex hacks okay let me know in the comments of course well I can subscribe below thank you for watching and have a good night", "mtAiSRX3LbU": "[Music] what's up YouTube chef Hans here bringing you another adults-only CBD and cannabis product review let's have fun guys get right into it today we are talking about plain-jane CBD pre-rolls ok so I played I found this company recently on Instagram I went to their website so they had school products so I placed a small order and I place it for their pre-rolls okay so this was 1099 okay $10.99 with $3 shipping so it came out to be $13.99 total now there was a I think there's six of them let me just double check real quick yes no 7 there is 7 pre-rolls in here in the present there was eight eight pre-rolls in here can't count I guess today so it took about four days to get to me I believe I almost at three but there's four total days so it was like a half a day in there of handling so that's pretty good service so this says that it has zero milligrams of THC and it is eight eight percent CBDs 60 milligrams per cigarette 480 milligrams total and the ingredients now it does say the top contains hemp rolls and matches but here's what it says under the ingredients it says industrial hemp which is great and this is lotus what does that mean who's that like lotus flower right I mean that's cool if that's what's in it I just want to know what is lotus I don't know what that means but that's what says here's the back of it we'll get down closer you can see the products and stuff like that but what it includes it includes eight pre-rolls and I'm having a problem now opening it there's this little piece of cardboard right here and it wants to catch the cigarette and kind bend it open so that's that's no bueno anyways so these are pretty cool these are their discrete way of medicating while you're out in public so it looks like a cigarette they claim it's odorless they claim or they don't say it's tasteless but they do say it's odorless and they say it doesn't smell like hemp flowers so if your work or something you need to medicate you're having bad day or something and you just got sound cigarette break or whatever and puff one of these your co-workers gonna not really know because you know it looks like a cigarette and from what they're saying it's smell it doesn't smell like industrial hemp or you know cannabis or whatever so that's pretty cool not sure I guess maybe that's the Lotus maybe that's the Lotus that's in there that makes it not have so much of an odor I'd love to know what the ratio of hemp to Lotus is just for my own curiosity sake anyway so it comes with cigarettes and matches and it's got a little striker at the bottom fear you know Wego fire and so that's pretty cool it's like an on-the-go way but let's bring you down close real quick and you can see what I'm talking about see the product alright guys so here's the package this is what the front looks like plain-jane CVD rolls point nine grams 60 milligrams each with matches playing Jane is what the back looks like it says I'll leave it there for a minute so you can read it or just pause the video and you take your time reading it so inside says there's eight so I've actually already and again I'm having an issues like this there's the issue I'm having that little flap is catching the filter and then one to bend the cigarette preventing its ultimate that's frustrating alright so now that's open I've already smoked one which we're gonna doing the taste test now I wanted to taste it first because I was kind of skeptical having filters like this you know I used to smoke cigarettes of smoked cigarettes for 13 years tobacco cigarettes quit roughly about three oh I quit about three years ago and I switched to vaping and I did that for about three years and not recently about a year ago quit vaping and I've been just fine I've just been using industrial hip products ever since and I have don't really have their smoke cigarettes anymore but I was kind of concerned with these and will pull one out I didn't know if you were gonna really be able to if this is gonna filter out any of the good stuff you know the CVD or anything in it I didn't know if filters like this did that so you know it's my first experience with a pre-roll like this like an actual cigarette so here's the end of it and I might break one of these open just see what the inside looks like but this is what it looks like and looks feels like cigarette if the smell of it smells like how tea smells oh that's exactly what else well this smells kind of like how tea smells there's no really other way to put that that's just hot smells so let's do a taste test real quick well I've already recorded it pre-dinner ahead time cuz I wanted to be I wanted to be fresh on the brain when I did this video and I knew everything about so let's do the taste test real quick and we'll talk about the effects what's up guys here with the plain-jane CBD around for you CBD rolls okay this thing looks like a cigarette it's got a filter on it like cigarette I mean it's supposed to be their low discreet way of medicating out in public I guess and they say it's almost odorless and it has a little bit of an odor it was nothing like you know what him flowers smells like the taste didn't really have a taste I mean it does it's like tea tastes like tea now tea smells oh no it's not bad senses 60 milligrams of CBD in this there pretty cool-looking yeah there you go Plain Jane let's talk about effect so after you know the taste test video you know I can just cut it off but I do finish smoking the whole thing so I would say about half way through this I start to feeling slight effects sounds like wow that's crazy because like said the taste I mean it's not much really of a taste and it's not much of an odor so I was kind of skeptical even smoking it guys I mean doesn't taste that it tastes great but I'll tell you so after I finished it I came back inside and put all my gear and I sat down wow man it kind of hit me I like it was just like overwhelming just like shoulders just melting I just felt calm and relaxed and I felt you know I'm not like a body high but it was just you can feel something but it wasn't like a high it was just I felt I felt good and I felt very relaxed and I just wanted to kind of chill and I kind of lose my eyes for a minute and it was great so definitely surprised me because like says it's not first experience with the pre-rolled with the filter and everything on it and I don't know why I was skeptical I just I was so this is a good product I will leave the link in the description so you can check them out they have a pretty awesome product I think I believe they have other products too I'll definitely be checking those out soon because this is a pretty cool product I like the discreteness of it like that doesn't have an odor so you know you if you have to medicate public and I mean for having 60 milligrams of CBD in each that's great I mean that's perfect that's a perfect amount to medicate I want to be good for a little bit so definitely definitely check them out guys Plain Jane there's that again we'll go one more time to the back see if we can get it to focus well just go back in the video palsy so if you like this video guys make sure you smash that thumbs up subscribe tell your friends we're going to be coming at y'all with a lot more CBD product

whole vlogging thing's kind of new to me I never used to mean a vlog or anything I've been a long time a vlogger but you know back in my day we didn't put ourselves out of here like this cuz times weren't like how they are today back then things were a lot more strict and whatnot and you know you didn't want to put yourself out there on blast but you know I had to get back into the community

joint then I ever would out of a point and pretty much anything else [Music] now will I be doing this very often hell no but I just might make another video to see if I can roll on even smaller plays it's got to be one of the smaller joints I've ever ruled [Music] [Music] [Music] it's a testament to this weed that I'm actually feeling stuff but you know I really smoked it all to do that I'm feeling it and I think I'm feeling it more than I would be feeling it if I was [ __ ] just smoking a point in a bowl could it all be placebo sure I think it's out its out and I ain't relighting it

went to the kitchen I went to go get some [ __ ] like somebody drink or something eat I was checking on something so anyways I had got up off my bed to go to the kitchen so I went to the kitchen came back had my lady in the couch on my bed and I went to take my slipper off so I have put like raised up my right foot and then I tried to kick my slipper off and as I kicked down bra it was all bad as I kicked down my foot caught my email cord bra oh and as you can imagine the worst happen the [ __ ] email came tumbling down the [ __ ] drop down came off the [ __ ] red was on the ground water spilled the after bath of that [ __ ] Oh bad that bucket after bath of that [ __ ] oh the custom girl rig into pieces guys it's in pieces it's in [ __ ] pieces and you know what didn't [ __ ] break this wasn't the downstem that wasn't biscuit that was the drop down that was on it this was the drop down that was on it and it didn't [ __ ] break so this [ __ ] [ __ ] was damn near set up like this in like this right oh [ __ ] me oh it cut me [Music] look that [ __ ] really cut me anyways so this [ __ ] was dammed out here like this like this and [ __ ] he came crashing down off the table boom boom bap this [ __ ] broke this didn't break I wish it did this was only ten dollars this rig came in a daily high club box that was like $35 so in any rate I [ __ ] broke a rig again check this out this this right here is my first ever piece of glass I bought it was if you could see [ __ ] if you can see that [ __ ] just diamond glass this was the first rig I bought I bought this [ __ ] off 420 in San Francisco on Haight Street just because by huh be cool ja needed add a brick to take a dab out of so I was like [ __ ] I mean let me cops up so we can take some dabs she was taking dabs on 420 with my homie cool John that was reason why I bought this piece but then it ended up breaking I didn't break this piece but it ended up breaking and it's just what happens when you have glass man [ __ ] breaks so yeah I'm a little salty that this shit's broken because it was like my best setup that I have for an email and my mom gave me just peace so it was like you know didn't cost me nothing but [ __ ] it lost me everything do you feel me because this it was tight so that's his god broke-ass it sucks this is still going it's burning just fine it's burning like pretty slow for being just one person token on it it's hella nice is burning evenly now that I finally got it going it's [ __ ] blue brah that's just my favorite I wish this was blue but my older brother got it for me his favorite color is red so that's the only reason why we're cuz my brother got it for me for Christmas so shoutouts to my brother you guys think about this area should get along whoo so yeah guys that's what I've been up to just working on the [ __ ] grind making sure my finger don't bleed out just been working you feel me putting these videos out let me know if you guys like this style here or if you like it over there where I sit on a couch I'm on the other side of the couch and this is like where I sleep so [ __ ] if you leave a comment down below if you like it this style view like looking like this to the side having to cuz I get a better lighting from here when I'm over here on this side I use a [ __ ] lamp light and this burnt out so yeah if you like that should I have to go get another

open leave a comment down below what you guys like to see better yeah it's going pretty nice so yeah man all right Pete to the custom grow 420 really that was like to clean this piece to use on my email this because it had the least air restriction it was like a juggler you dumb you just like you can you can just take a toke on that as hard as you wanted to in you filming you was getting your whole dab unlike this piece right here because of all the [ __ ] little [ __ ] and [ __ ] in here all these little [ __ ] you kind of have to hit it harder to get more airflow this one you just and it would just come at you didn't even have to that had no restriction at all [Music] sidecar [ __ ] super slid the fuses I [ __ ] was bomb but r.i.p we got anymore come on you mentally smoke too much flour on this channel but we'll try and come out with some more content with flour I do like some open oil it's my shake that's pretty nice the ash is pretty white guys my review on this since I've been smoking it this [ __ ] got me [ __ ] loaded so it's a pass you feel me it's easy on the throat it's easy on the lungs you get fat clouds out of it and this one in particular is actually rolled way better cuz I actually if you will go watch my [ __ ] what video maybe it's not even in a video yet [ __ ] well I [ __ ] had two of these right so I had this one and I had this one which was the red one and the red would damn near was trash you feel me I didn't really like the red one now I'm not hating on it because it was [ __ ] red but like when you [ __ ] took a toke on it like for some reason it would just like it would hit like you could get a cloud off it and I smoked it to the face and I don't feel like I got loaded off it it tasted cool was black cherry but I don't really like that one but this blue one is [ __ ] bomb cuz like my eyes are already low as [ __ ] is this I'm just higher can't even it's hard to explain it it's way better and I was damn you're gonna smoke another one with you guys for the [ __ ] of it yes this one the sour tangi because i got two of these too and I still have both of them that I need to throw up and it's from the same company so they got these where's that [Music] damn cuz I was gonna put a fella forgot because I was gonna put this [ __ ] out and light one of these [ __ ] right here because one of these is tangi sour tangi sour tangi and this one is [ __ ] juice this is a good old uh and this is a indica and this one is a hybrid you feel me I forgot I was only gonna smoke half of this and then smoke one of these down but [ __ ] damn this [ __ ] just went out so this one just went out I'm actually gonna [ __ ] spark one of these [ __ ] it I'm Lexie I'm gonna just our tangi I think so lucky sour tangi this one here okay so this one just to recap really quick high voltage it was a pre-roll raw cone had top-shelf blood in it I don't even think I said this Kylie's finest og mix for life president it doesn't even say [ __ ] on here covered with OG key and it has live resin inside and I'm assuming it has you know top gel blood in it because that [ __ ] was pretty fired this one here is a premium cannabis rolled with the foot Premium Canada strolled in nature and natural leaf nature I'm cuttin hi this right here nature's combs premium cannabis rolled in natural leaf nature's calm calm distributed by Kings coast

so just so yeah so the none of that [ __ ] did falls out I'm actually gonna keep that on there yeah yeah yeah I got that [ __ ] back on their breath okay so I'm gonna leave it on here just because I don't want this [ __ ] falling out so this was genius and idea number one [ __ ] smartest [ __ ] so this [ __ ] don't fall out it has a [ __ ] filter in there that's pretty [ __ ] dick it's got this cool little band on it to hold everything in it's a palm leaf is what they told me if I'm not mistaken you take a [ __ ] swag ha yeah so this is a palm leaf I'm not mistaken so let's [ __ ] party be spark it mother sparker yay Cheers [Music] [Music] the flavor on this is kind of hard to describe I don't know you've got a [ __ ] try this you I'll know it makes you feel like you're smoking something luxurious and I get to one of the finer things in life I don't know it feels like Titan it is smoking awfully fast then taste on it though to taste that you really came to I've not tasted this flavor with the joint or a blunt on the ball or pipe [Music] super hard to explain the flavor dish it's hella good too I just feel like I should be doing something hella cool friends rather fast but it is what it is this is awesome $15 log with all the other woods this filter is pretty cool [Music] see if I get a good one what I used to do back in the day is that blow out of oh I blow out of

grams total thc percentage in this weed is 16.42 that's not bad this is a sativa the strain is outlaw and outlaw is a cheesy phenotype of amnesia haze that's what it says on their website um we will see how cheesy it is i do like the cheese i do like the cheese cheesiness says to me more sativa it's always kind of had the higher up more energetic lower thc great for the day [ __ ] just spin them up all day long and not have to worry about too many repercussions package date so package date is may 8th 2020. now may is not too bad we are in july today is july 14th or 12th july 12th today we'll say okay so the package on may 8th i don't know what that means because if you can make these pre-rolls in january and just have the boxes sitting on your shelf and then put them in here on may 8th and then put your package date may 8th but you're smoking january dope that's what could be happening we don't know that's just an unknown let's open it up see what we get here's that little sealy sealy sealy sealy so boom we're getting in there what do we get oh it's a little package there's a thc picture on there and then there's nothing else on this pack this is a nice little slick little pack though i do like it i'll slot right in my pocket yeah ripped off the plastic there let's go for the open opening oh some little tinfoil wrap there like a cigarette pack normally you just pull okay oh yeah there's there it is there it is pull that away and then we have ten readies up in this batch boom look at that there's your retican ready now the marijuana inside you can clearly see there's marijuana inside that's good that's good that's what i'm hoping for let's do math real quick here the package comes with 10 pre-rolls the package weighs 3.5 grams of dope so in each pre-roll you got .35 of marijuana i paid 24.99 for this package that makes every pre-roll about 250. so 250 for .35 grams of dough now let's see what's in the pre-roll just for fun that's what this is about we're recreational we're just doing things for fun i'm gonna rip this batch open let's get you open let's see what we're smoking on is it sticks is it stems is it seeds we don't know let's see it's not dry and crusty i will give it that you know you're not uh may 2nd package date the weed that's falling out is not dry and crusty there is a bit of humidity left in there that's what you want yeah yeah we'll do a little dance for that okay so there's .38 of dope in this pre-roll that's on point perfect ah do another dance you're getting dances today now let's see what's actually in here so it's not too bad look at this this is a stem here okay that's something you don't want to really pre-roll right here that's leaf okay so there's a bunch of leaf getting in there this is definitely bottoms okay this is bottoms this is the bins after it's handled weed you're going to grab all this bits and you're going to put it in your parel that's what's happening here but there is flour in there too it's not all sticks and stems it's not all leaf matter you can see the leaf matter there's chances you know when i roll my joints i report all the stem all these little bits that affects my smoking goodness these are i'm pretty slick i mean i am slick but i'm also pretty happy this is a little slick pack um i'm looking forward to getting all snapped up here it's [ __ ] 420 right on the dot too hmm not bad not bad not a whole lot of flavor there's really not a lot that stands out on that taste i know i'm smoking weed but there's nothing to complain about either right i'll just start there so good good good good in the past i've had two other radicands actually have them right here i have the waffle and the god bud done both these they were both 29.99 which is a great price and they were both quality dopes they passed the test they're rebuyable they're suggestible check them out check out redican this is gonna be perfect for me throughout my day a quick little snap snap i'll take my i'll take bowl hoots throughout the day just to get my medicine so i can keep going that's what this is very convenient actually and for 250 per joint all i need is one and then i continue on my day this one's almost going out though i need more than that so you got a second one going right away before this one goes out and you just gotta keep her going it's smokeable but it's not flavorful that's what i like to say there i smoked my second one i'm getting down there i'm getting pretty snapped up i am feeling good i'm starting to forget words here you go friends take one of those put it in your mouth later later as easy as that smoke three at once if you want whoo [Music] you can like two up and give one to a friend if you want that's how easy that is to they're quick lights that is nice it's not like uh they light like a cigarette you smoke you know one two three four five there's five more somewhere one two i lost three okay so no i have four i have four in my hand and i got five six seven eight nine i lost one when i threw one to a friend but the neat thing about these this is really cool let's say you're like boom out on the street you're like hey bros guess what i just

lightweight one will get you go going if you're a lightweight one we'll get you going but if you need a little more than one light up seven they're they get going good now you know you light them all or you can light one all right so it is smokable weed there's no way i do that if there's no way i could do that if this wasn't smoke but we this is decent weed okay there's there's not a lot of taste there it really just falls in the sativa category that's what's going on there so there's no point for really enjoying your bud the weed needs to be better but the convenience and the actual product is fantastic straight up fantastic these are quick you want to go out on the boat you want to even [ __ ] take a rip on the sea-doo you want to go up in a hot air balloon grab these like wherever you go you can just have these with you have these in your car have these in your glove compartment i just smashed through 10 retican readies the overall smoke was a little harsh a little dry there's not much flavor in there at all but the pure convenience of having smokeable weed rolled up into something like this to just have on you wherever you are and blast away whenever you need just real quick boom boom boom that's awesome the weed probably a six five that's where i'm sitting with the weed six five the actual product the actual product get fireweed up in this [ __ ] the actual product is an

roll that [ __ ] like that [ __ ] i'm your neighborhood weed man roll that [ __ ] like that [ __ ] smoking i'm your neighborhood", "YW6EEZNiwFw": "hello everybody okay today I have a super quick tutorial walkthrough if you will we have a lot of people really interested in CBD joints but have actually expressed that they don't know how to use CBD joints so I'll kind of walk through this you know product this is made with industrial hemp flour it is a full one gram joint it's rolled with raw papers it does have kind of you know like a paper filter in there so when you're in handling the part doesn't go into your mouth and so with that this is the part that goes on your mouth it will say we're all on it and it's more like the slender side at the bottom of the joint and then on this end is actually what you're going to light with fire with flame I'm gonna use matches we also sell hemp wick in our store here we start CBD you're welcome to use lighters pretty much anything that will make fire is how you're going to light the pre-roll but I'm just gonna basically show you how to light the pre-roll on how to put the pre-roll out Oh quick other thing to note because is a full gram I don't recommend smoking the whole thing out once this is a really great product to share amongst your friends this is also a really good product for yourself but just to know that you don't need to take puffs to complete the whole joint you kind of smoke until you feel it so usually for me when I'm smoking enjoy by myself I'll take you know anywhere from three to five hits kind of let it rest see how my body is responding to that and then if you want you know there's no harm in smoking more just know that to get the effect of smoking CBD you don't have to smoke this whole one gram joint that's actually a lot of CBD in my opinion and I'm Allison to go on this piece and this is a side that I'm going to light and we're just gonna do a quick little minor joint if I can light it so the point is to light the paper kind of light that hole first you know circumference of the joint you do take a few puffs really big inhalation is just to kind of like get that cherry on the end of it lighted and then from there you can just kind of inhale and take as many drags as you want like I size you through to four drags but the other thing that I wanted to show you guys is how to properly put a joint out so I recommend using a metal ashtray there's also ceramic ashtrays if you happen to be outside concrete is fine you definitely don't put it out on anything wooden because this is a flame but you're gonna basically take the end and so this is how I'm gonna preserve the joint so I can smoke it later if I choose to I'm just gonna gently kind of tap it out you basically want to suffocate the flame sometimes depending on how much you smoke you can kind of push that lit piece out and again I just kind of dampen it out you know just to make sure that flame isn't still lit but you can put it out and basically when I wanted to refocus I would just light from the end again but that'd be south and basically you're trying to suck the heat from the end all the way through using your lungs that's what's lighting it and pulling and burning that hemp butt of that hemp flower set you can have the effect of smoking CBD so hope you guys like that video if you have other questions for us you're too afraid to ask feel free to you know DM us on Instagram also come visit us in our store at restart CBD we're always happy to talk to you guys in person and yeah we actually sell these

fuel and sour diesel with a sweet and spicy finish what'd i say i get a more earthy i didn't say pine i get it more earthy i don't get a sweetness i can see what they say spicy but it's not really

on some [ __ ] barbecue Maya we haven't had a video like this in a while we got the homies it's original people that did the hotbox especially with the bait pants I don't have you guys remember remember where yeah the video we were casually talking and this was choking in the back when I gave you one long-ass time ago when you still worked at Jamba Juice yeah and we met up at the park near Chris's house at Hughes right I don't worry about up yeah was there maybe nothing wrong please you don't remember that day in that video where we're casually talking and then i zoom up on the video are off his face while he's like choking Oh RJ I'm saving this [ __ ] Joey what are you doing at 4:20 you're not smoking fat I think if we do this we don't need to smoke for the rest of the day just become the plant so a fortnight comes in with kron4 and so you wouldn't know it's ok to know so while they relax I don't force your [ __ ] this really dope guys can't Destin check them out honestly I don't know the price of this but if I had to guess I would say in the forty fifty dollar range maybe less depending on where you are maybe thirty seven where you can buy here in the Hollywood yeah he was just he was in there the homing Hut the homie Tyler shout out to you Tyler but yeah let's definitely don't this shows all the [ __ ] look the charge one twenty five percent THC it's definitely super stiff neck is twenty nine like cruises twenty-six it's just like my teeth deep it's like inhale it for too long you know Eastern Conference if I would just have pulled out right away it's actually really smooth basically THC in the hit is absorbed already instantly 95% of it the you hold it in any longer you're getting 5% instantly it's I looked it up that's what I said instantly you don't need to hold it in just breathe in breathe out it like you're trying to smoke for a good amount of time you know you can't be holding it in especially if you're smoking about backwards guys that's just real [ __ ] yes exactly and it time multiplies with the effect of you getting high plus you're holding in tobacco - so it's like a high that people seem to really enjoy you could probably pass out from that [ __ ] yeah I've seen it happen I've seen where uh my home between gravity just holding it in and you passed out and he fell on the rocks his Marx cousin outside Brian's house and apparently uh Marcus did that - off dabs jammer fun no though Marcus passed out off dabs before you like fainted yeah so guys just be safe you know with that knowledge it can go a long way especially with your health um you guys know holding in smoke and your [ __ ] body is not good for you you know so holding in as as less as possible as you can and plus we're hotboxing in right now so it's all being recycled at the end of the day it's like even though we chose like our own strains we're still in the smoke of the other strains oh sure I'm not good with hotboxing tell you that right now why I'm not either I just can't breathe and I'm I can't breathe no clue I got I finished a bitter I know [ __ ] this video I'm understanding though so I'll [ __ ] play them oh yeah I'm understanding - [ __ ] those women I'm gonna stop it no cell [ __ ] on me okay did you really know about you guys but I'm almost I'm who's done are you almost done you stopped a long time ago Oh it's a good one though guys [ __ ] you're not honey I'm how high did I I'm done with his own yam them there you go guys no no that's not how we do it here this 420 we do something big Amy all right okay okay all right guys let's see alright guys there you have it yeah that is the plan 20 special I actually made it back and I hit the [ __ ] I hit the fence and then I was just like whose height was I all right there you have it guys peace out Lina 4/20 stress sleep [Music]", "di5IVd9pECg": "all right i was about it i was about to smoke i was about to smoke one of these and i was like hey might as well make a video on it right so i'll make a video on it and we're gonna have box hot box the bean [Music] let's see if you guys haven't seen any of my other videos i have two other videos of jeter i have a one gram in the xl this is going to be the baby jesus um these are [ __ ] gas man literally um one hand of these will get you [ __ ] feeling different already like if you and your friends are not heavy smokers you could literally split one of these between three people um i split i mean we split one between three people and honestly i got pretty lit off of it i mean like it wasn't to the point where i wanted to but it got me way more high than i thought it would these things are amazing man this is a five pack of baby jeters this is a fire og is gonna be a hybrid for some reason this package doesn't have any of the thc information you can see everything's all blank maybe it was like the setup case or something the display case or something but the manufacturer date and packaging date was september 23rd so a little bit old about over a month old it's a five pack premium indoor flower with distillate oil and keef weighing at 2.5 grams these periods are going to be weighing around a half gram each burning time is five minutes let me go ahead and open them you gotta push down that comes sealed already open to seal you can see there's four of them in there it comes with five already smoked one all right i know this is all right y'all know this is a weird angle and [ __ ] but i'm in my car so i don't really have a good place to set it up i'm gonna go ahead and take one of these out spark it up um i already know how these are hitting man these are [ __ ] crazy small ass [ __ ] joint bro but [ __ ] hits like smack so let's go ahead and spark this [ __ ] up got the clipper spark it uh are [ __ ] crazy [ __ ] love these joints if you guys haven't tried any of the jesus strains before i recommend the fire og i recommend the gelato 33 and i recommend the durban poison the banana cushion was cool it sounds good but i don't know to me just it wasn't like i was like one of my least favorite strains that i've had i probably had all of them already but the only one i think that i haven't had has to be maybe the ramadan grapefruit that's probably like one of the only ones i haven't had you can see i've been hitting it for a cool amount it's barely starting to to burn down they also have um a different line of these where they're not infused it's just like a fire ash puro and they have different strains on them so i need to make a review on them because they have some pretty good strains i don't remember off the top but i remember seeing some cool ones it was a lot of strains i haven't had before yeah these pills are really good though man i mean one is like all right two of them will get you highest like though especially in the morning have you just smoke with these especially in the morning man you'll be smoking these they will hit hard um this is already midday i already made a video if you guys haven't seen made a video about the dab cap so i'm already pretty lit but it's a good joint you know just to like get you level-headed um you know if you're not lit so so far i've been recording for four minutes and 20 seconds so um that five minute mark is pretty true i guess the first minute of this clip was me talking about it though so and i'm talking about like that first part where you guys see me come to the car that was like a different clip so i'm talking about this clip right now it's recording when i put the camera up is that four minutes and 45 seconds we hit the five minute mark now five minutes three seconds also what's really cool about these is that they do not turn off if you cannot hit it for like a cool minute and it'll still be on by the next time you want to take a hit officially been smoking over five minutes so it's true burning time is about five minutes if this weighs a half gram it must be a 0.4 flower point five of a key point five oh some wax i'm guessing that's how it works um unless you count the point five gram as a pure flour but i don't know uh that's gonna be it for the there's gonna be a for the video though y'all hopefully y'all enjoyed the video hopefully i'll tie y'all son hopefully i'll learn soon hope y'all got lit with me and um catch on the next one man peace okay bye", "SirWa2OLGQo": "[Music] [ __ ] enemy I'll fill it in a finish it today we got a law review about dr. zodiac moon rock free roll but before we get into that [ __ ] of course you know I gotta ask you [ __ ] of [ __ ] please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate anybody that's here and always say cuz I just [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that see if you get a notification anytime I make sure you also follow me over on Instagram it's kind of make underscore no cat that would be make sense canna under [ __ ] that cannot underscore what it is anyway yeah you think I already smoked this [ __ ] right but [ __ ] bad let's get into it slow down I don't know if you guys remember back some time ago I had done a review on dr. zodiacs moon rock vape cartridge that [ __ ] was pretty fire so I figured why not do one of the pre-roll that they have now with this free roll was so cool about it we'll find out if it's actually cool but it has it says it has a supreme cannabis flower I hate when they say they like who is supreme top notch tell me the [ __ ] string that damn it but anyway they got flour here does also keep inside of it it also says cannabis extract which is like it has a sauce in here and it says terpenes so we'll see what the deal is on this [ __ ] let's open it mmm okay so I'm gonna see that you got to keep on the outside the tubes no good I will say that okay so the powder is on the outside the Keith and I'm not a fan to keep on the outside of my [ __ ] and I ain't saying it's wrong I understand I'm not a fan of that [ __ ] and the reason for it is but I will say they didn't over adjust it because some of them just be so [ __ ] frosty when you go to a [ __ ] off you keep just balling up - god damn it so it seems like they didn't over dust it so with it being on the outside it might not be a problem from that so I give it to him on that now I will say on the flip side of me saying I don't like to have it on the outside sometime we'll know if I could say they put them on the inside I got a pre-roll before and I open that [ __ ] up and I didn't find a drop I keep in that [ __ ] and ain't no way nobody can convince me that the [ __ ] was just in the bud and I didn't see it because I'm still gonna put it in my grinder and I shook it so my keep catcher and I didn't get any Keef out of it really so that is one thing when they put it on the inside I don't know if they tell the truth that's really in there so if I put it on the outside that does kind of at least let me know that that [ __ ] is there and like I say it doesn't seem like they over did this it looks like there's probably about point to the point three of a gram on that and of Keith so I think they did a pretty good job on that so I gotta give it sold now this is a little too big from a slaver later yeah man the Snider lighters Douglas an electric lighter if you haven't seen that I got a reveal that two dishes dope but this head is a little too fat to fit inside of it there's my [ __ ] sick as [ __ ] watch nice right so anyway I'll just use a regular lighter see I wish it is that's nice make them up like a sit back like man he leaned back mmm this is nice I like it has really good flavor to it damn I like that [ __ ] he got a pretty taste to it yeah man yeah I'm not I - I might a fan when people put like extracts and [ __ ] in joints I haven't felt like it's wasting extract because the temperature ain't hot enough to really give you the effects from it you know so if that's this almost like sin you might as well just smoke a bowl of dab instead of anything so I don't really like mixing concentrate with flowers and stuff like that because I just realize they don't really make a difference I mean I just feel like I'm wasting extract like let me know y'all so I can go with opinion on that [ __ ] like if y'all think is beneficial or anything because I might be overlooking something on that but to me it's kind of a waste when you do that but they did it on this and I'm not gonna front it but if I can taste I can I honestly can taste the extract the sauce that's in there because you know it's sauce when you hit it on the right type of vaporizer or even just the right type of though I'm not fake but the rig sorry is what I'm trying to say if you get it the right way on the rig at the right Tim you can really really really taste like the terpenes in it so I can really taste the terpenes in this but I can also get that that extract flavor to it I don't know how to describe it you know you get like a after flavor of a dad when you dad that's what I'm kind of getting from that so I kind of got to give it to yeah I like this and it's rolled into Rock own man we're all coming up they got everybody putting these [ __ ] and they stood up yo I just ordered a new bait it's a US adult it's so just like weed and wax and [ __ ] it's the pulsar rock so we don't see how that [ __ ] is so show Peter next week so as soon as I get it of course you know I'm gonna [ __ ] do that [ __ ] for y'all right but Jimmy much else about that start cooking my food for the week get my meal prep in I also got some good news for y'all but I gotta get this series together to show y'all but I got some really fun stuff coming I'm kind of kicking it talking to a child right now what the [ __ ] else can I say about I got a I'm joined but I got some pretty cool stuff for y'all coming like you guys really really really encouraged me when I did the video of showing what bud tenders see like [ __ ] but tender see you guys gave me some very encouraging words so it kind of encouraged me to do some other [ __ ] so I got a lot of stuff that I would be doing for you and I'm working on things right now so just sit tight I know my videos have been a little slow posting cuz I've been working on some other type of things but that's why I figured let me make sure I do this so I could at least holla at y'all but there's all kind of [ __ ] on the way like coming so stay tuned [ __ ] so that is the end of this video I would say that I do like that pre-roll definitely I definitely like it three worlds a lock but every once in a while I like to get one and so on it's kind of cool to know which ones delish and I don't think I've ever done one on a review with you guys on one so I figured why not do that [ __ ] so anyway that's the end of this [ __ ] I'm out of this [ __ ] all right so it's Kennedy make sure you go follow me over on Instagram make sure you can actually got me hooked up okay let me rewind a shrew shrew okay so make sure you follow me on Instagram

hemp here in beautiful huntsville alabama it's late in the evening sun's starting to go down it's getting dusk pretty soon be time for me to to call it a day but guys i want to show you something [Music] this is our delta eight pre-roll that's right it's a raw king size pre-roll holding approximately 1.2 grams of our cbd flour once it's dipped and then the cbg and cbd keith put on it you're looking at just over 2 grams you're getting about 670 milligrams of delta eight along with a little kick of cbg and of course the hemp flower that's there so what's that gonna be that's probably gonna be somewhere around the neighborhood of [Music] six seven eight nine shoot that's probably gonna be over a thousand a thousand milligrams yeah that'd be over a thousand milligrams of cannabinoids all together you know counting the cbd the delta eight the cbg just look at that it's beautiful i don't know if i can really get you see how some of that that little hanger on right there trying to peel off but guys this is a beautiful beautiful product uh got another one right here let's take a look at it and see if see how it looks ah there we go as you can see the delta is dipped up to here it's not all the way we may start taking a brush and actually brushing it on all the way back so we get it get it going completely there because the flower itself the flower itself is not infused uh or sprayed with with a delta eight but uh man there's a good basically a a gram of delta eight on this flowers like say man the hit's gonna be phenomenal and then the rest of it after you get through with the delta eight you go down to the regular seaweed flour which is the last uh well you spoke more than half of it with delta eight on it and cbg keef but the rest of this is gonna melly out because it's gonna bring it it's going to take two people to smoke this thing i believe i know i can spoke about myself talking about a gram of a gram of delta eight along with uh 1.2 grams of uh cbd high you know high cbd flower shoot but anyway guys you get two of them two of them shipped to you let's see what's the price there's some hole let me let me check it real quick make sure i'm telling you right let's see [Music] okay at 17 with free shipping you get two of the pre-rolls now i know you say well i can get 3.5 of your spray of 3.5 grams if you spray flour [ __ ] to me for 15. well guys they some manual labor uh you know in this right here also you're getting [Music] i don't know if he didn't really more bang for your buck but it's different uh you're getting a pre-roll flower that's packed well it's got a great uh the uh the the flour that's used as actual flour it's no shake or anything like that no seeds or very little seeds we try to make sure seeds don't get in there no stems great product so i think for 17 dollars shipped i think to 1.2 gram actually is it being like 2.2 gram pre-rolls so you're getting total 4.4 grams you know compared to 3.5 grams of actual

how are they all right you're watching the song I did you the saga continues pre-rolls major seller for just about everyone that sells them I want to show you guys innovative ways to package your pre rolls again 2019 being that critical year that you have to stand out you have to get your share of those millions of consumers who are coming into the market for the first time you got to separate yourself from just the traditional pop top and you should subscribe to the channel too because we're going to be showing you eco packaging innovation in 2019 and other stuff to Ingrid without further ado let's let's show the audience some pre-roll options if you are a dupe tube user and you want to get away from that but you're not quite ready a way that you could do that is to get a punch and put your tubes into a pouch and then you just have a little bit of an upscale way to market your product a little on the fence with that idea but I could even see that being that had like a really like premium or like luster looking pouch with like nice felt a nice like velvet exactly that could be really with like as gold hot stamp or something for more premium trim like we talked about before that fits for it you know you're telling a story it's say for example similar to the first batch of naturalistic feel to granola vibe it's now in the woods vibe but you have a bunch of pop tops you want to make additions to it so whether it's a craft label or a craft sleeve or putting it inside of that pouch its additions that we can make to alter the vibe that you're giving and then you know the next stage is we can really give a custom feel to exactly what you're looking for to build it from scratch but we can do those alterations in those modifications if you guys have already made purchases to get it more on point with what the store that you guys are trying to tell okay another way to move up from the duke tube is with these four tubes which you can get in any size and we can do all kinds of finishes on them this one has spot UV on it the clear varnish that adds some shine and it has a hot stamp on it this one is using a spot pearl varnish which is has a slight sparkle to it you make these any size and something you're going to hear also that we hear all the time it's just about how you keep these fresh so we do with people putting the doob tubes inside of tubes like that or you can put it in a little baggie as well - if you think freshness is going to be concerned if you're not moving through the product really quickly really popular for people that are trying to get away from the plastic look still have that really cool you know cylinder a cylindrical look but completely made out of board recycled board so really with a nice alternative to the classic plastic duty alright next up it's a folding box that has a soft touch of varnish on it so when you hold it in your hand it automatically feels a little bit more elevated or a lot more elevated than any kind of standard do to be folding boxes are far more affordable in terms of cost and like rigid more premium boxes so you might think oh I can't afford a box for my pre rolls because you know the price point isn't high enough but folding boxes like that that's like a 25 to 50 cent box depending on the volume that you're ordering versus the rigid ones are gonna be more dollar than two dollars depending on of course the specs of what it is it's simpler and more complex but don't rule out boxes for even low ticket items because there's ways to do them really affordably Manny I want to get you on the show before the Animus but what do you think about what have you found people like using on the pre-rolls has it been more like your customers have been more folding boxes rigid boxes tins what are you kind of seeing in the market so for like a single that's where I think people are more cautious on the pricing but for packs that's a higher retail price point Melissa welcome to the show that's the vault box you guys said a lot of you have seen that child-resistant certified you need a key or the flat object or pencil the true versatility of the vault box that's a beautiful rigid box no like buttons hanging off easy for consumers consumers love it and perfect for a pack perfect for a pack it's another fan favorite we've shown on previous episodes of the cannabis packaging show whose creation was this one is this a ingrid or had the creation you you come on to the show and hold the product is a family place its own this was another customer who had due to dupe tubes that they were trying to elevate the look of so they went for a larger version in this box there's an insert inside that is holding their tubes it's holding three so that you can do it in two Kasim sativa hybrid you could do a morning afternoon and night you could do a blank blank and blank three different strains whatever it is so these are ways to sell the product often the packaging is going to dictate how you're actually selling in your business strategy so those are always fun conversations that have when people are saying aren't so like not just making the packaging but what's the strategy behind how we're going to sell it gold plated tin gold plated if you want to go with like you know $100 pack of pre-roll isn't really make an impact you got the gold plated tin it's just more when we talked about we cater to all markets and Gucci's of the world the marque mass markets of the world if you're going for that vibe you're telling that story you want to elevate your packaging to the highest level if you're not and you don't then we find affordable ways to still tell your story and if you need a child-resistant sliding tin go to contempo packaging comm and drop your email in the box and we will send you when it's ready we'll send you an email when it's ready got quite a few see our innovations in the pipeline Jody's excited about them I could sell with with a quark trap which is a nice way to package on your pre-roll and then you can put it in something else these things are wildly popular my thing with these is like okay for how do you fit all the compliance information on them so like is it going to be a label that Flags or do you put it in a box I think sometimes I see brands they have a really nice primary package they're not considering compliance and labeling and then the end result because it's not done you know thoughtfully is the actual consumer gets something that doesn't really look too professional kind of looks tattered this is one example of something that you could do with those vials just put it into a nice box like this which would showcase them as well because this is clear acetate that look of the product being suspended is really cool doing it with clear inserts and showcasing the product so it's not really competing with the packaging but really the focus of what you're trying to show off Nick what do you like in terms of pre-roll packaging what are some of your you know that you're selling to into the market or even as a consumer what's like good pre-roll packaging yeah so I really like the cardboard spiral tubes I think it's you know a changeup from the the typical pop tops and we've had a lot of people very interested in them recently and and we can dress up the wrap with different print print techniques and make it you know really be able to tell your story we're constantly bringing you know boatloads of shipments in here so again tacking on to some of the shipments that we're bringing in so you don't have to be afraid only over a couple of thousand pieces of flying it in and if you have the time we can tack it on to one of our many boat shipments so that we can add you to the large retailers that we're doing and make it much more affordable than if you were just on your own we could do a whole show in 2019 about projections and how do you buy efficiently and how do you not just buy when you have an immediate need because you incur unnecessary costs but that is not the purpose of these shows so angry please continue all right last two things to show our non contempo items but definitely worth showing because they are very nice this is a lipstick tube that is a push to release feature fresh seal to the clicking and has embossing on the top stay tuned and this last is a box this is from Milan so we shopped the market in like big fashion cities to stay on top of trends and this was just a gorgeous box that obviously the dimensions would be different for pre-rolls but I'm just thinking like that would be that's like a game-changer that I think sure that under the Shelf and you've got like like a pre-roll or like a simple box versus that thing in terms of making an impact and getting people to notice you that's the kind of like thought process I think we should be having I think it's important to also consider what your consumers gonna do with the product so in the case of a bigger box that's gonna go on a coffee table that's gonna be a showpiece for a party they're having it's Christmas time you're having a Christmas gathering everyone gets their own pre-roll another thing that's popular in the market right now if it's a three pack five pack seven pack of pre-rolls where is that going when your consumer consumer leaves the store they're going to a concert they're going to a show it needs to fit in a purse it needs to fit in your pocket so those are the types of things you need to think about in terms of the actual end user so to speak and what they'll actually be doing with and how does that add to the overall experience that that packaging provides so keep that in mind as well just drop in great points right here knowledge boy I love it all right guys any other pre-roll stuff from the showroom that is worth showing our wonderful audience Ron's coming up for the display show drunken building displays longer than I've been alive so we have full boxes once more about the lux and they're really clean packaging that's soft touch finish with a nice hot stamp on it all right good stuff all right we'll see you guys the next episode thanks for watching the cannabis packaging show we're contempo specialty packaging see you soon", "GYu8Z7zlpTI": "[Music] hi it's Matt from Rafal studios and welcome to kena basics today we're filling cones with a brand new raw loader this episode of can of asics is brought to you by the roughhouse studios smoke shop selling raw cones grinders papers containers and much more save 10% off of everything with a code canna basics first let's take a close look at the new raw loader it's a brand new product available for under $15 and it's designed specifically for loading pre-rolled raw cones included in the box is the loader itself along with a thorough info pamphlet a nifty cone shaped natural wood packing tool and a cool plastic scraping card the device is simple and apparently it was inspired by the classic broom and dustpan the loader is designed to work flawlessly with pre-rolled raw cones that you can get at most smoke shops many dispensaries and online you'll also need some cannabis and you'll want to grind your material into a nice even grind but not too fine I like to use a grinder but some people use scissors or a knife or their fingers and that's just fine too after you grind your herbs simply slip the cone over the narrow tip of the loader push it in and it'll stay stuck on there then use the card and the wide scoop base of the loader can rake up and load into the hopper all of your cannabis then you tilt it to control the flow of the cannabis as it is funneled evenly into your cone use the wooden tool to tamp it in as you go then twist off your ends and voila perfect cone and seconds I know we went through that pretty fast so let's go through it again a little bit slower after you graduate slide the raw pre-rolled cone onto the tapered tip of the loader then use the cart to scoop up the cannabis into the hopper and funnel it into the cone carefully using the wooden tool the narrow end first to tamp down the small end of the joint this is so it doesn't flop around obscenely then use the larger end to tighten up the wide tip so then you can twist off and pinch the excess paper bada boom bada bing your cone is loaded and you're ready to smoke simple no moving parts and inexpensive we thought the new raw loader was worth sharing with you so if you like it and you'd like to learn more or to purchase one or many of the other items you see in the video

singles this is also a high-bred just right there so this is two half room joints super cool I kind of like that a little bit smaller a little bit thinner I would say and the other grams that I've been getting is two half gram pre-rolls from Pacific Stone pretty nice product really nicely packed sealed at the end and nice tips thanks for watching", "fP3MT6VrwXY": "are you good at mine's a little crazy because I mean I grew I was selling like medical marijuana like by eight years ago at the dispensary at harvest I've always been like one foot in one foot out but like mostly I just have focused on Higgs and not necessarily canvas I'd like what will be cool for our lifestyle brand canvas is intrinsic to me I mean I'm a smoker so I know what that's like I saw you know what else does it go with now that we can openly talk about we also saw a parallel to or has a million is there a difference like trying to start up your company having the yeah cuz they're each their own entity it's not like if I don't answer a merger they don't really have much crossover um peaches like a Joan thing so it's like starting two companies cakes is just a lifestyle company that has clothing we throw events and then we make free rolls right now and then the free rolls were doing like a premium pack as I said and we run a couple collaborations with artists our restaurants and that we kind of diversify what we're trying to do which is like the Emily wood comes in sight guys we throw this event called buds on rose on 4/20 we actually got a cute shot from The Hollywood Reporter number one event in LA by day but basically it was like I canvassed crawl pub crawl and treasure hunt bunch of businesses on board you check into checked in that civilized offices you got a map and then people just I walk around you get a free cocktail cholita or Makani vanilla sleepy drink they're a house party house on Griffin Rose so yeah there's like a really fun dance like again it wasn't just about canvassing but not interacting with like all the other things in life and canvas is just like a bite more like just another thing you're adding to that like you're walking from place to place you're smoking over your friends and that's perfect [Music] I was wanting to get into a competition and then one time I was at a house party my friend easy brought me to but not good more dudes at the house they obviously didn't like me I know any of them and then this joint run competition out now since I've got a gym in this transition right now that was like and I blew people away they're like everyone's like friends of me after I invalidated my skills as a joint if you can even reverse this thing which is something to be proud of I think that's like where it really like wins we're like getting the society to change their views on it I'm sure you faced a lot of negativity on on what type of lifestyle you're trying to provide with pigs and I tuned it out and don't hear any much negative noise on what I'm trying to do it doesn't really help because because I you know I don't think that's the case I can't even give ear to it [Music]", "pnZH-k4XYgs": "[Music] today I got

what up guys should grow clean cannabis coming back to you here on channel 4 2008 today we're going to be determining is West Coast cure cured joints aka pre-rolls really worth 15 bucks a pop I think it's affordable for a pre-roll 15 books in it really bad I feel like that's how much pre-rolled should be costing across every brand alright I just depends like what store you go to sometimes you can find a 3-pack for 25 bucks this string that we're going to be smoking on is wedding cake they say there's one whole gram in here the packaging I like I like the way it's like simple black it comes in like maybe like I don't know how you guys smoke or Medicaid but if you do blunt this is like what a pack looks like for one so that's why I like it opening it up it has a really pungent smell to it like a very very strong weed smell loving the tasting west coast here I love west coast care brands you can never go wrong with west coast here whether it's a pin a pre-roll dabbing and I just really like this I cannot wait to spark this up this smells like wedding cake cookie actually so we're gonna spark this up my roommate bought me a new laptop for the channel I'm so excited so we're actually going to set up the laptop it sparked this at the same time see how highly actually okay so if you're not getting high right now whip up that blunt you've got that joint you've got that read and let's get it okay I'm gonna actually cut this pre-roll open just like the tip and then we can break it down the last 30 seconds of the video and see what's inside the taste is impeccable like this like I said the smell of the stream was fruity and pastry at the same time and that's what I'm getting from the taste to zone actually was gifted this laptop because I was complaining about editing and that's another reason why I haven't been even posting first simply cannot edit well the slow computer that I have so I'm gonna take this over and flip it over this is the Microsoft Surface go I wanted this laptop I didn't think I was gonna get it like I could literally like kiss my roommate for doing this for me like I have some great friends down he also got me this awesome board so that this is

everybody who wanted to see a pre-roll review so open it up here never bought it before I rarely buy approvals I bought for my life if that one and a half grams here infused with shatter and Keef like I said smell good I'm just kidding we're gonna cut it open come on I'm gonna bring the camera closer let's see what's really in here and that top-shelf pre-roll let's slice it open here see what we got inside looking like a nice light green color like some good-looking bud so so far so good so the sight test it's looking decent smell test I'm not smelling a whole lot right now a little bit here so sites looking pretty good smell let's double check that decent I mean it might be sitting for a while let me see if I can change the angle here actually giving you a little something better to look at this might not be the best angle so I'm gonna get my phone here and see if we can make it look a little better cell phone looking a lot better we can see that nice green color and see some of that shatter and there little dots I wonder how much exactly was in there looks good smells decent so past those two tests now let's do the most important the taste test tastes pretty good it doesn't taste some of the best flour I've had like that fresh flavor this might have been sitting for a little while doesn't taste that amazing I figured with the infusion it would taste a little better so the taste let me down a little bit here so that's that I'm still gonna smoke this [ __ ] also dropping some really cool merch if you want to show true buds TV a little love grab a tank top hoodie shirt

way I don't like um stuffing too much all at once because I feel like it's harder to go back and push everything in and make it tighter for example like if I were to wait build all this up and barely started stuffing it right here it would have been much harder it would have been loose from the bottom that makes sense we want to have everything evenly typed I usually pack my clones all the way to the end I'm just gonna go ahead and I actually learned this little trick I'm closing it a different way and twisting it up and from Louie okay mr.

but i have a a ten pack of pre-rolls um i thought i'd make a video about this just because uh they've been really popular here um always selling out at like every store and even online from the aglc um so we'll see um kind of what's on boxes and see what's going on inside um yeah and i'm trying to do this video in one take so uh we'll see how that goes nice so um they come in a little baggie like this with a box little box inside you might be familiar with those opening these little bags used in a lot of other products um sixteen point four two percent thc package may eighth and uh yeah from ready can called the reddies and it's going to be the outlaw one other sativa strains so yeah let's get this open they have all the hairways needed so the knife does not need to make a showing today after you get that open get this little pack inside and uh yeah definitely almost it pretty much looks like it's way too small to be ten pre-rolls in there and um you might recognize them they didn't always come in a bag they used to come in little boxes like this yeah so um here are the pre-rolls and we'll get these guys open almost like a little mini cigarette box even sealed like them so yeah these payrolls are apparently 100 machine rolled which they must because they're so thin and they use cigarette papers as you can see uh they're quite uh quite long filter makes up for i would say almost like more than 25 percent of the whole joint and then flower would be pretty much everything in the white and maybe a little beyond um but yeah i'm not gonna smoke it right away instead um i'm actually gonna weigh it i was always curious because they say that there's actually this package has three and a half grams i have always wondered if that included like the whole thing or with like the bud and the filter or was it just the butt so let's give this away and see what it comes in at so of course this is not the most accurate scale but hopefully it'll be close enough okay so oh my gosh the joint itself weighs 0.6 um grams so if there were 10 of them it'd be 6 grams total so it must uh it must not include the filter then so um how we'll find out is uh we will actually bust it open i'll empty out the bud into a little container and then we'll see how much it weighs okay so i've decided instead using a container i'm just going to dump all the bud onto the tray since it's not that much to begin with so yeah wait till it's zeroed out and i'll cut it open and dump it there and uh we should have already gotten a good look at what it looks like on the inside i'm gonna get clean cut there we go this is not the most accurate scale and also that's probably not the most accurate way to do it but i'm just so curious to see what actually weighs like in these little pre-rolls of course i told you it does go down beyond the black part just a little bit but we'll get every last bit out just for the weighing to make it nice and fair i think this piece was from there too actually no it wasn't okay anyways you know not the most accurate so take it with a grain of salt is what i'm saying and dang right hand pretty good it's 0.36 like right they're actually exactly 0.35 gram joints wow i'm really surprised actually my scale is shifting around to show people how not accurate it is but anyways you get the point it's uh pretty close not bad pretty good ready can we uh store this somewhere i actually wanted to give this a squeeze just so people can see it's actually i don't know you can determine for yourself what it means but when you squeeze a butt can almost like clump it together so i don't know not bad not too powdery actually the grind is actually a lot more coarse than what i've seen in a lot of pre-rolls like so in some pre-rolls it actually looks like powder almost especially some of those huge one gram pre-rolls but these are the grinds actually quite coarse i'm surprised", "R2k6nSJN2cI": "welcome so I have a pre-roll for you I'm enjoying the pre-rolls this is called tough balance hybrid 100% premium cannabis flower [Music] this is distributed from sac or West Sacramento if I can get it to focus here alright so there we go there is their Instagram 2019 recycled so this has got some standard warning and all the information on the pre-roll so you've got the THC as being 228 potency twenty two point eight two which is what they have had on the other ones this is a one gram this one was 729 it is called balance balance allowance anyway let's break this thing open I did not see any perforations on it but we'll see if we can get into it in a plastic too [Music] all right so we've got a little bit of product in the tube not quite sure where that's coming from because it seems like it's pretty sealed at the top anyway [Music] looks good the paper is a little bit past the tip but so it was packed a little light in this area but you can just squish it down to to fill that you can see there's already a little I wouldn't call it breakage but a little bending at the end that's packed correctly it doesn't seem to do that thanks that is tough balance thanks for watching", "hiUDv0BVAHs": "of you to this your boy big night 420 lifestyle today we're gonna compare these raw calls versus future roller combs rolls are natural refined rolling paper and I'll surprised that both of them come from out of the country rolls are made in packaged in Indonesia and they're from the Netherlands and future rollers are from the Dutch rolling company so I guess roll papers come from different places like Paris France and all that so I'm gonna do my check-in and find something that's made right here in the USA and try to do a comparison on those but for right now we're gonna do the comparison on the raw joint versus future robots so when you check them out you can tell a definite difference between both let's start off with this raw one the rolls are a natural paper no bleaches and nothing like that they actually come with as if for the future rollers to tell their bleached white paper no logo we're gonna kick back we're gonna invite them both up we're gonna try each eye will see there's a something that how did burn what's the difference between a refined and unrefined paper hey barn how to smoke am I gonna smoke the whole thing of each one make the video too long but I will have a couple of a percentage one same weed in each one Sour Diesel will start off on the draw also Roth coming more than just wanting more force these are actually one-on-one force and the future Rovers are stated is king size 25 millimeters let's start off with the rock not much that you taste as in paper with the raw both going how's everybody day going hope you had a prosperous week with your family and the waiting is going okay that's your joy comparisons y'all wanna see we're all gotta even burn so that was the wrong good taste so now we don't get this future relevant and see how we working for me how'd you guess a few trouble each paper or white they both range and about the same price range at the store maybe a quarter different sir a lot of places it becomes impacts well it was or the king size future rollers came in a three pack and the Ross came in six pack I thought that was a little future role as you can see I'm getting good good slow burn I really think that is more up to the person to try out what they like you know try you want it y'all make your own choice cuz you never know what you gonna [ __ ] it may even depend on what you smoking in it pi\u00f1on is my personal as I like the future roses better actually they seem to bear so slow oh really so have you got any suggestions for me of something that's made right here yeah that's right different type of papers are columns or subjects you want to see me prepare leave in the comment but this is my version of Ross versus Futurama so boom if you like their video check out another video if you look before a little bit more Big Mike check out my playlist if you really like Big Mike you want to see me all the time look down just a button it's a subscribe hit that button hit that Dale you know any time I post also you see my logo right here hit that you can subscribe to me too so have a good day", "jLJWAM_L4_c": "[Music] I've known always I know oh boy what's up guys simplistic here back with another video as you could see wonderful day outside you know I'm saying we're at Ben's house in his backyard and I I bought these pre-rolls like on Friday last week and I I'm already saying I already opened it I already used five there's seven of them and I saved two for this video one for me and one for Ben and as you can see the brand is called hervana it says 20% THC and the only thing I have a fault with this back packaging is look at it I don't even know if it was like airtight at all you know like this is not like yeah so it doesn't keep the joints fresh that's my only neck and it was a bit dry I'm not gonna say it you know I'm not gonna lie and uh I don't it's just pretty much all I can say about that but you have the lighter thing right here and you can open it well packaged not gonna lie for every ounce they buy they plant a tree or for every ounce that's bought from them they buy a tree or plant a tree that's pretty dope yeah so they definitely aren't giving back to the planet you know says a lot about a company that whether they're willing to you know do that so here's Ben's oh yeah and the packaging is biodegradable or some [ __ ] I don't know so they also gave you some matches tied to a hemp wick yeah so [Music] oh I'm running independent no I mean coming in my feeling [Music] so these are point fives each seven joints and these are for mostly the people that can't roll or in a rush and yeah those are basically lonely like from from a stoners perspective always try to get an eight and just roll your own because you don't know what they actually put in these I'm not gonna just spend money and then empty one and see what it is because I spent money on it but people some people do and sometimes it's just shaking these pre rolls so you just got to be aware and like I said the the airtight packaging was not there so it definitely does not keep the joint as fresh I mean what do you guys say about the joint it's smooth though right yeah oh it strain is this that's another thing I don't really like about is that they just call it hybrid which is a hybrid blend so it's a blend of all this stuff and usually when I hear blend I just think that they just blended all the remaining shake together their hybrid [ __ ] hopefully it's not the case but in the end I can't really tell but you could follow them and see it there I mean who knows you know good and it's definitely not bad you know I've tasted four screw holes right and this is like a little point fiber so it's like for those of you who are tweeting cigarettes but smoke weed like cigarette besides this you know I don't think ban was expecting the smoke all joined by himself today I just came through with it but luckily it's a point five so I feel like anyone can handle 0.5 yeah I'm gonna that's one good quick and like so when you smoke things quick especially when you only want smoking it it's still gonna be slow smoke like the other ones the other five when I first opened out that Blake's house mean and just had one were just smoking it yeah then when money came I gave him one to avert itself and then a half me and Blake shared half and then you came and I was just like you know just save this for what my do a video I played salsa [Music] but also seen a video recently of owl owl smokes which is basically the same kind of packaging just colored differently so I'm guessing that this this is a generic freewill pre-roll package that companies can buy okay I don't know if I mentioned it but the percentage was about 20% THC solders be like it's pretty good and this was running in about to pull 8th buys 25 bucks for the whole pack which is not bad right I mean I've seen worse or worse for price more you know [Music] look at it but yeah as you can see most good none of them ran at all so that is a plus in my book because sometimes you buy pre-rolls sometimes you buy single pre-rolls and then they run and it's just the [ __ ] ten bucks on this single pre-roll and like I said pre rules are for people that really are in a rush or can't roll or they just yeah basically on a rush or can't roll but if you can just always try to get the flower I for one was in a rush and I just wanted to like just pull one out and smoke it whenever I wanted instead of getting my fingers all sticky because I've somehow lost my grinder so I would have to break that out with my hands though you froze lost your grinder yeah I find it but it's like no I'm saying but yeah check out the coming company hervana let me know if you guys guys have tried their pre rolls in let me know if you thought it was pretty good you know so far I'm liking it like I had I really smoked like three before this so it was a pretty good smoke not gonna lie but it's not like the greatest pre-roll in the [ __ ] game you know yeah oh yeah well I also was uploading a video today and it said the gave you mute gave me an option to say is this video allowed or washable for kids or is it not this is like an option they added on YouTube like recently so I just click no this is not for children on all my videos so hopefully this is like a better chance of me not getting deleted they just added that so I'm guessing they're kind of like you know compensate for I don't know you know I don't they don't know but hopefully I checked the all of them I checked no they're not made for children hopefully I don't get deleted again that's dumb that they just delete your account for [ __ ] that in here twice twice how do you feel you feel high a little bit a little bit yeah so uh maybe the strength isn't as what it's advertised cuz 20% on a joint is pretty hot should ya be getting me pretty lifted that goes to say back to the the shake in the blend that's probably what what the case is mm-hmm but I mean I don't know I don't know what to say to take after this new it's a kick creeper yeah you gotta expect that with payrolls as you know you can't really expect to get too high because you can't expect the quality to be too high that's the first time smoking I didn't know nirmaia took a very there yeah so if you're like everyday smokers you know by your payroll is pointy not the way to go either that's true but like I said I was in a rush you know I'm saying that could roll guys yeah I can't roll good but good enough to smoke you know I'm not saying I'm like it's master roller over here but guess the job done but other than that the joints both of our joints are pretty much done hopefully you guys enjoyed this video I will see you guys in the next one peace out [Music]", "6NaBjz9Yd7s": "we can

mean there's a chance you don't wake up so like I get a little I get a little iffy about okay so um okay with that said the ins is kicking up a little bit so that's why I wanted to sit down and try to try to smoke this whole thing it's at 0.75 grams and on the scale at 0.03 houses okay I mean it's pretty cool last time I had this this the second time I had this on the channel the first time I had these on a channel I said that everyone you buy it donates to a dog in need which that is pretty [ __ ] cold so yeah this was like $15 I believe yeah not bad at all like I said Afghani man so let's just go ahead and crack in this and you can get her started all right this is a hard percent indica to by the way just bad boy all right I kind of I kind of thought it'd be bigger but it's really really really tight I'm not even gonna try to like take it apart or anything like that I'm just gonna get get to smoke into a society a little bit I'm having [Music] Cheers let me doing the comments what you guys are smoking on if you're smoking on anything yeah and let me know if you guys are having a good week so far you said it's Monday two days before my operation I did my ronan test today to cobia test they do it real quick on both nostrils man and tell you it's like you're sinking feel it like to go behind your eye sockets and it makes your eyes water up immediately is it it does it's not like it hurt it's more more just like a weird kind of burning sensation I guess behind your eyes and you can feel it in your nose like like maybe 10 to 15 minutes afterwards too you can still kind of feel a little bit but yeah let's talk about this my first initial hit it kind of burnt a little bit to be honest with you guys I'm not really much used to smoking much fire anymore man I've been smoking a little a lot of [ __ ] oils a lot of rosin you know a lot of rosin a lot of concentrates the taste is definitely a woody maybe a little fruity I don't taste no coughing but now maybe low for now but I don't taste no coffee flavor definitely little fruity it's a nice subtle taste smooth taste too like I said it has a little a little burn on my throat there and I think that's just from [ __ ] smoking fire you guys in Pennsylvania I can't buy these pre-rolls I guess and I feel sorry for you is it [ __ ] sucks but uh you know hearing good old Maryland and you're allowed to and you can smoke your flower and it's pretty [ __ ] dope I'm not gonna lie I could have bagged a [ __ ] paper flower consoling I'm getting a better taste on it now depth that one was definitely fruity like I said it's it's a hundred percent indica so definitely want to be at nighttime when you're smoking this one and it's definitely good for [ __ ] uh like like pain and and effects effects for like the body and muscle aches and stuff like if you just had a hard day at work and you just want to come home and relax and sit here and just like be couch locked a half-black Afghanistan like Afghanistan one of the strange you want for you it definitely eases the mind it definitely relaxes the body relaxes the muscles like I said it's like a soothing narcotic and it definitely is I mean I've only took him for four or five hits of it so far and I'm definitely feeling it right and I'm telling you what the taste it's getting even better I guarantee when I wake up in the morning I'm still going to smell my room is still gonna smell like just [ __ ] joint head normally does been a try some of these joints any kind of joint really good see how nice and white to ashes - yeah yeah this [ __ ] burn him beautiful yeah nice wish I could do like slow-mo if we are yeah that what only $1 works hopefully see we get that fix here but I already got a couple recordings ready for y'all so like I said I'm not just gonna leave gone hanging man like I said the first time around it won't be no videos I'm not gonna go hang a man I got a couple videos a very pretty record for the [ __ ] time when I'm laid to [ __ ] out yeah so be definitely be on the lookout for them [ __ ] man I will give you all those deep video right this disc cartridge right here I open it up yesterday and at first they gave me kind of like a little hot flash whenever I did the review but I turn my ACS I think it was a big part of that puss breaking a bacon with the liquid live resin cartridge it definitely threw me in like a hot flash but afterwards once I cool down man the bus is really really [ __ ] nice and I'll tell you from a G leaf liquid live resin cartridge FS e cartridge whatever I think I forget it [ __ ] means um yeah it was pretty good so be on the lookout for that review blueberry scone just like the porn snap blueberry skunk fire bro blueberries Conchas fire I mean literally look I killed it I killed it it was that it was that good I mean I just the oil burnt really fast and I'm not gonna lie like I mean like on a normal Cresco card the oil would last me three four days the way I was smoking it this one here that was done within a day yeah like clearly at 24 32 hours time it was done it normally doesn't happen like that like I said alive Cresco car some [ __ ] last me for at least a couple days after me I have to only doubt for about the G leaf-like reliable riser cartridge so far so far cuz I only had one and take what this [ __ ] definitely um looks even like it has some like oil in it yeah my fur is nice man and to be honest with you the throat burn isn't even isn't bad at all anymore like I guess it maybe that first initial like maybe it was just from the [ __ ] you know what I mean I don't know maybe it was you know I'm just book search anymore August 17th to be here since I haven't had a cigarette so like you know inhale [ __ ] the gas anymore so like I said I ain't been smoking much fire to be using lighters and [ __ ] so I'm try to smoke this did that cough too much right nobody wants to sit through a video and fin just hair [ __ ] hacking and coughing stuff I think I'm doing pretty good SIGCHI Finn this [ __ ] alright I'm just got it I was under 13 minutes up [ __ ] whatever time it is we're doing good see my love sign up here it's pretty cool right see ya

something nice to me not like you guys don't I just say it is like my fourth time being uh put down and every time you just ask areas first the thought is always in the back your mind of not waking up right that can happen anytime again put down any type of surgery I don't get but what kind of surgery it is even it was the most simplest kind of surgery there is you could [ __ ] not wake up for it something could go wrong I try not to think about it too much this my friend my friends is definitely helping it out I'm sure I look [ __ ] smacked as I feel smacked I think this one's in the book boys I believe I had a black Afghani flower before buy it makes double you see I'm not sure where the hell I had that the black Afghani fire from but I have had it before and it was [ __ ] amazing and it looked beautiful as they called purple maybe it was maybe it wasn't Marilyn Allen I understand but maybe that's whenever they first started putting in their own [ __ ] jars or packaging or [ __ ] classic however it is you want to [ __ ] all I'm pretty good boys look this thing went out i'ma go ahead in the video here I'm feeling nice imma [ __ ] hop off go to bed get ready for work tomorrow

and today we have a review of a new product for you guys the turret that directed that directed that that small roles focus focus focus but it comes to five already been smoking in but it's not see this guy for you for you to what it comes with five people with about 0.75 three-quarters of a gram and each time come to the cool smart board lighter torch and the case that a convent is actually very heavy-duty very very very impressive I gotta say though I some blood on this out of mine this is uh as wet as a super Sour Diesel 25.4 4 % TT 4 to 12 percent CBD and it's actually pretty smells good but definitely good presentation this box is awesome and the letter that the concrete is awesome too as well let's just jump right into this and just walk it up get a little taste it'll taste with you about it so yeah see how it is [Music] yes it actually takes pretty damn good see woman's ever ulis mmm Thanks it's delicious either way we do about I gotta say - presentation on thing it's good the way it burns burns pretty pretty evenly you know tastes freakin good this [ __ ] is frickin insane it's made of only the hand-picked Triple A indoor bug was the hybrid for those people who don't know about you know these this is a hybrid of this flavor and they don't for someone some of the other people's that all our based on some of the other pre bowls that I had in the past in previous videos people joints specifically I feel like these ones burn a little bit faster than the others would you agree with that yeah I did these bread a little faster on a scale one to ten I'll set up I'd give these like a solid eight point eight eight point five eight and a half want to scale one to ten for presentation and everything one things that you expect when you smoke too late that you expect to get like super blasted I think definitely the way it's presented mmm you know I tell you know somebody comes to the hey I rolled the joint but then you come over then you're like y'all hold up a second let me pull out one of these bad boys oh wait I got a lighter with it too you know it just makes it for anything else are you just really shits up like that for this it is definitely better quality than like then like an actual cigarette case or a super box for those of you smoke cigarettes you know this is easily just crunching versus this [ __ ] that like that's it ain't breaking this is like heavy duty and the - my dog I say is pretty damn good it's pretty good hi from scale 1 to 2 10 don't say the house probably about a 9 yeah some flowers if you guys have Lulu watch the act that's [ __ ] fire the act about Gypsy Rose before he live very good yes Thomas girl was 10 how would you say the high of his buddies he says about seven eight I say about nine no I like to hire a bit como vamos surpassed them I wanna love I do see I'll be killing roaches at other people's house or act like calling embarrassing but so we got time for today guys", "EZ8C_0-Uk8Y": "what is up guys that blank talker back here again welcome to another video man in today's video we got a product review of some pacific stoned pre-rolled joints a hundred percent premium cannabis so a little back story on this i went to my local disco over the weekend and they were having a sale on bees they were 40 dollars before tax and the second second one they were offering is for penny so i got two of these and I've been smoking on them and I've been liking the lead so let's get on with the review so how you open them it is childproof so you just squeeze the sides push the front end right here you have to do it there we go and then well BAM it comes with 14 joints but I've been smoking out of this one and one and another thing that's pretty cool with this as well is that they tuck it up with a little pack of matches my dude like that's what's up so you know if you can't if you don't have the lighter or if you don't smoke this much you don't have to get a lighter you can just use these matches out of this box so I am a little bit stoned [Music] this is my second time trying to record this my phone ran out of space so I'm getting double liddie today's let me know what you're smoking on down in the comment section below I'm gonna light up the match and we'll get on with it man just gotta have my ashtray next to me so go and light it up so it's just give me a second so hell yeah I like using the mattress man I think it's pretty cool different because I always use lighters books and Clippers but you know it's something different I thought it was kind of cool something really different but I really thought and the Pacific Stone they really did a pretty good job with the packaging and the joynton and adding the matches I thought that was pretty cool and I really do you think it is worth 40 bucks I think each joint joint is like about half a gram each so that's like you get 14 so that's like about 7 grams and for 40 bucks oh well after taxes like 46 48 bucks the tax here is pretty ridiculous in California but [Music] but yeah so you're paying just about 50 bucks for seven grams so that ain't too bad in the this ain't no [ __ ] pre-roll either dude it has a pretty good taste and I get pretty stoned off it and I usually smoke it with somebody dude like I smoked it with my mom and just like splitting it and smoking up with somebody dude I got

tourist or something like this this product would be perfect for you [Music] because you don't have to die the [ __ ] papers it roll them grind it up like eg just buy it already done really good flowers [Music] so yeah man I was pretty I was pretty stuck when I saw this because I think one spark it's federally legalized in the next couple of years I think after that twenty to twenty five years after that in grocery stores you'll be able to buy a pack of joints and I think that would be pretty [ __ ] sick and you know it's kind of can't come early I know they're just only selling it at the Disco's but still that's pretty cool [Music] damn we're almost done with this and then I'm going to get out but I'm going to have their website down in the description below and yeah I really liked it like this these green rolls man and there's a lot of [ __ ] shitty ass pre-roll companies out here in Cali man they always tried to [ __ ] rip it off and it's [ __ ] just complete food in bottom shelf like disgusting ah [ __ ] but this has some really good flour in it and it's worth the forty bucks man [Music] oh yeah man if you have it already shoot me a ball on instagram at that

here at es studios today we'll be discussing the raw cone filler this relatively new product was created by raw with the intention of easing and expediting the process of packing raw pre-rolled cones they come in both king-size and 101 quarter to fit every smokers needs let's go ahead and take a look at what this ingenious new packing tool has to offer attach the raw cone filler itself you'll also find a bamboo packing stick as well as an additional packing tool which detaches from the bottom of the cone filler to make it easier to pack the trench an extra mouth tip for the filler and a short instruction manual are also included will take you step-by-step to show you how these nifty tools will come in handy when filling your pre-rolled cones now that you've unpacked all of your cool new tools you're going to want to take your ground up over tobacco and begin filling the top of the filler with it then using the packing tool that comes attached to the bottom of the cone filler pack down the herb into the trough until you can securely closed the filler then you're going to take your pre-rolled cone and slip it onto the mouth tip of the cone filler being careful not to wrinkle the paper now close the top of the filler ensuring it grasps onto the tip of the cone then at a slow and steady pace slide the top part all the way forward then all the way back to its original position being cautious not to detach the cone as you go some users like to partially slide the top back and forth a second time to pack it further while others use the bamboo packing stick to slide the rest of it through the mouth tip and into the cone as always pack your herb further down into the pre-rolled cone using your bamboo packing stick to ensure your cone is packed evenly throughout finally twist off the top of the cone and there you have it a perfectly packed pre-rolled raw cone despite the fact that Rob's a great care when creating this innovative and effective product we have run into a few minor issues with it and have received several complaints from customers regarding them personally the biggest issue we've come to find is that the cone filler will oftentimes leave a partially unpacked space near the filter tip causing the cone to be flimsy our solution to this has been to pre pack the cone slightly before using the cone filler in order to avoid cos the complaint which we have received them most from our customers however is that the pre-rolled cones will at times not fit onto the mouth tip of the cone loader unfortunately this issue has been addressed by Josh himself the founder of raw rolling papers as he has stated that because of the fact that free rolled cones are all hand rolled there will always be instances where they will not fit perfectly onto the comb through it in any case the product itself is still quite effective and convenient as it makes the process of packing pre-rolled cones ten times faster and simpler thanks for watching our video we'll continue to release videos every week if you have any questions suggestions or comments feel free to leave them below and most importantly don't forget your parachute", "MhgixaJCLY8": "they rolled up to Lamar is served by a pothead smoking on one of my evening bless that's the flavor you let me put it all spin move let me we'll be looking at a vibes free roll call without further ado jumps a close-up get into the review I burped up some old bird Moody's flap in the comment section have you take a look at the date pre-roll cone today we're looking at vibes and this is a rice cone oh the rice paper kind of burns up completely the word doesn't really leave a s I'm hoping that it also doesn't have that process of rolling paper taste we're going to do and get these out the pack so you can see what they look like alright burn club these are the vibes rice papers pretty decent papers I'm gonna go ahead and run all our chests on that one census looks kind of funky so we're going to use our lean green machine to hold this in place gonna stuff it up with some of this week and see how the smoke so let's get this thing filled up and see what it do [Music] [Music] hi Bertha got this vibe rice cone rolled up and it's real easy to feel we use the lean green machine that's like one of my favorite cone filling devices you're gonna do your own sapphire on in front of this and see where smoke-like begin I'm hoping that their taste of process paper isn't that strong in this but we'll get some firewood see what it do all right bear claw I think it's a fire oh just buy rice drink just raining so my dear to hear that but I do like to smoke on a rainy day so go ahead get some fire on this why be drink see what the first size to each matter was like [Music] all right well there is the descent of process paper um it's not that strong but it is definitely here we're going to take the first poll to see what the smoke actually tastes like I'm thinking that it might not taste that strong because it's not that strong in this ice cream but again I never want to get ahead of myself let's see what this thing you're doing yo now roads up there is a a fine line of paper taste going off the side street but it doesn't show up that strong in the taste other side of smoke like light I mostly just tasting the bud and it's a very Turkey but and that's really all just coming through right now there's very very light very light one of want to taste of it now I've had other rice papers and they perform basically the same way there's a very light underlying taste of rolling paper or both seniors who taste when you smoke powdery rice papers is weak now that side strength as it comes off of the earth is gone into my nose that smells just like processed paper does yeah there's no way of guess around that scent coming off the side string because all of them have that same thing but again the taste of this paper so far is one of the least strongest process paper tape again it doesn't mean that it's not there because I do still taste it it's just a very minimal we look at the ash on this what you see on there is really just the weed this burning of the paper that burns completely to where we look at it you can't you can't see the ash of it at all first bleep well hurry up there winds out there howling right now through trees a very good smoke coming dry like I'm I feel like my esophagus is very dry whoo Smokies that is my bra cubes I brought you a drop it is smoking with them mama daily say this when you see these do me try they know to think if you try them how did you like me again it taste for me it's minimal compared to a lot of the other rolling papers I've done in a long time but what do you think I will smoke the rest of this in five no is - grandma - Amar'e to Lamar Facebook into amore life you know what the first time I've seen divides I welcome to the head shop close to me it's the one that goes to to get a lot of my stuff and the lady behind the counter was like um the vibes just came out I was when I did the employ oh the Hempleman was pretty good like this race one better the process paper taste is fainter on this that that help one has a vegetative taste bud and the stronger process paper tape still one more hit we got to do do you want to get some but I like this racing never stopped me the do it is out there to the world Wow Merkel so much we got me going to the moon Neil can't see [ __ ] too much smoke up in the room feel buzzed burning slow - slow it down smoke with me there's enough to go around so good ain't the word that describes my Irv y'all [ __ ] get that rich", "90i9gwPVILY": "[Music] hello and welcome back to the canvas small ei I'm your host Andrew Friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of cannabis reviews and our special episode series battle pre-roll were three pre rolls down from trailblazer they've been pretty good not great we've found a winner from these three already now we have one last contender in the ring and it's from tweed I assume TWD it's a pre rule we have sixty point four milligrams of THC and 70 milligrams of CBD so it is six point four percent THC and there's a little bit more CBD in there this is our first one Graham joint of the competition and warning do not drive so let's get back to it Krakauer duty seal see if we can get into it there we go and there is our joint it was the best protected but it's the most bent you will notice top is not twisted off and let's lock that up well the other ones took the tips off this one has it on so I will light it with the tip on to assess it the way it would like that's the raw King size it's been packed down quite a bit again it's a 1 gram joint let's check out what the top material is looking like all right so you can see some different colors you can also notice that it's a little bit dried out it's not a bright green or an exciting green in the hand it smells like old cannabis for sure kind of just a bit like a milk chocolate but you can't notice quite a bit of Keith in my hand actually so we shall see how it burns twist that back on I guess I'll get rid of this crazy tail even though they left it on there which is crazy to seem lighter same lighting process except a little bit of wind now so I noticed one thing right away that it's just not burning that well but let's give you the courage buff and let's go so as far as the burn goes you can you can clearly see how it's changed as far as appealing flavors go there are none it just takes like hot smoke its ran instantly like really badly none of the other ones ran like that this one really ran but you can see why because the air pockets in the bend not as definitely not hand finished or hand finished the same way the other ones were I guess I will fix the run a little bit and keep off and on it it's not easy to pull on it tastes like old wood as far as battle pre-roll goes and the actual need to continue smoking this and the grade that I want to give it I think we can just stop right here so this was tweed balanced TWD balanced THC CBD this was from which lot sorry lot 1 9 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 5 4 and of all of them we had a bar set pretty well 7.5 was our highest it tasted pretty good it burnt nice and white and it burnt straight what are we gonna give this I guess it gets 5 just for being cannabis but would I buy it again no I paid this was actually the most expensive joint of the entire battle at six dollars and fifty cents I believe I paid for it or maybe it was six dollars but I think it was 650 and it definitely leaves the absolute most to be desired so would not buy again five points TWD so I'll show you if you want to watch back you can watch the final episode and watch the conclusion and hear all of my final thoughts make sure like comment share and subscribe until next time Cheers what's my name what's my name the cannabis Somali yay", "7GVOuzVf_eQ": "[Music] hello and welcome back to the Canada Somalia I'm your host Andrew Friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of canvas reviews today we're gonna be doing battle pre-roll I've got four different pre-rolls three of them from trailblazer one of them from tweed and we're gonna find out which one reigns supreme and how they actually stack up against each other so we have spark stick glow stick prohibition blend and a balanced blend I think we should start with the prohibition blend and we'll move on to the others so what's going on with prohibition Brunton hybrid blend forty seven point four milligrams so just shy of ten percent THC this is a half gram joint twenty 1902 twelve was the date was packaged so quite a while ago back in February and Trailblazer license is Organa gram unopened non broken duty seal there's no CBD in it let's see what's going on inside here see if I can get into it too I know there's a technique to this but push tab push tab pull look I got it I am NOT a child there is our joint this is how much packaging we have for one half gram joint from trailblazer check that to the side for now we'll make sure to recycle it and pop this guy open looks pretty cool this is how you would imagine legal weed being sold and we have a nice little tiny joint with the top trimmed does it smell like much kind of like a lemon pledge lemon dawn alright there's our package is not a resealable package so you're gonna have to smoke your joint in one go this is one dose got a Bic lighter figure that'd be easiest well let's take a look at the cannabis that's inside it quickly just to see what's going on there and I'll put a little bit in my hand so you can see right away actually that there are some stems right there so it is maybe the shake but just that little bit one nice big stem so yeah some of my predictions are coming true I guess I really didn't want to see a stem but there it is let's light it up and see how it smokes it's very dry finely milled so it should should burn pretty well roast a tip a little no more than 10 seconds note once it's a first impression it's quite tight one of the complaints I've always heard is that all the pre-rolls run a little salt and pepper burn tastes like it smells lemon pledge a little bit of skunk it's not overly enjoyable but it's also not terrible the one part I'm having a hard time with because it is so finely milled the canvas is quite tight in there so I can't get a really big rip on the actual joint you can see the ash the burn no oil ring is present at all but no matter how hard I rip it it's quite it's quite clogged up and so you know that's indicative of too finely milled of a product packed too tightly you notice that the top was cut and twisted so maybe it was hand finished and really packed down in there itself it tastes it tastes like it smells it's burning a little bit darker now that that bottom half all right I think we've smoked enough to make a conclusion and let my cameraman have some I would say smells like it tastes I think I bought this joint for three dollars and fifty cents from fire and flour so for three dollars and fifty cents you know it's exactly what I expected if not a little bit better to be super honest with you if this product was a half gram for more than six dollars I would definitely not be looking to purchase it what pull no good taste all right ash quite white did find some stems in it seven out of ten seven out of ten make sure you follow up on battle pre-roll check out all the other videos and while you're there like comment share and subscribe see you soon Cheers what's my name the cannabis Somali yay", "2bhTDkVkSp0": "[Music] what's crack-a-lackin' y'all i'm sorry ass welcome back his first time here thank you for stopping by hopefully by the end of this review you

yeah this is the indica strain we're gonna start off with this let's see if we hit the sound no oh that's squeeze it yeah but it's to India that's right because on the site because I said to I was like I already got one but it's a two pack oh so I'm gonna do one which are it's so dope that is so it's an indica strain indica dominant mix of Grape Ape and grapefruit that is crossed with another undisclosed strain to produce this candy flavored cannabis bread by third-generation family and turf hogs the chunky colas explode in the expectrum of light green here okay well I can't show that now because it's in a pre-roll but yeah now y'all been watching me you know sometimes I read these descriptions and what else's and I'm like where do they get this from so I'm hoping this I'm excited for this because I've seen this straight please be that candy it's not just be enjoyable I was an indica so I'm gonna see if I'm getting that you know that effect we're gonna see us together my loss Oh

again you know these strains we're talking about like yeah yeah yeah I'll taste that you lying country delicious with a magnificent aroma which is sure just a good smoke overall which is true real smooth we just you you hear me coffin it's easy on it though very nice and smooth great for pain and stress thank you and it has less you know 0.3 JC so what that means is legal we only use sweet high quality buds no shake and I appreciate that I don't like shake so what it's saying that it can help with pain and stress relief promotes natural sleep mood enhancements and helps with ADHD relief now it says all of these things and not necessarily it may not work for you but these are the things that are saying that this strains it'll skittles Zittel you know what it is can do for you and it burns

so tonight we have for you another pre roll from Highgarden and I did a little bit of research on this one and they do have an Instagram but I cannot find where they are out of there they say California but there's no city or city this one was $10 and it is a gram and let's just go over and review this one so the batch number producer produce produce date this one is [Music] nineteen point nine two THC and a zero or point zero six CBD that's one gram all natural crafted cannabis this is an indica it does not have what strand it is strain strand that is their website I did try to go there and it seemed to not work as well as I was hoping for but this is Highgarden let's open this baby up so it does have a seal on the top clear bottom it's a nice roll to it packed pretty tight has a nice twist there's the mouthpiece filter alright let's see who we can get into this thing and see how it looks alright so there's your product I burned it a little bit no that's still just the paper oh I don't know if you can see but a couple people have said this stuff is pure a mmm it's hard to tell it's all ground up alright so take a little dry drag off of it again cuz I taste good not bad let's light it up a little bit oh and I forgot to mention this is from cocoa farms in Antioch and they are an affiliate of Rio Vista farms in in Rio Vista California definitely getting a good drag out of it and that is Highgarden I always like to do the extinguish test looks good looks like you're gonna relight it nobody oh thanks for joining", "zZ1-HZXeaVY": "what's going on guys my name is Jeff also known as popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe I got a lot of lip videos on the way like today I'm gonna be smoking this pre-roll from Lux rolls now Lux rolls is a company that sells cones that you can stuff yourself to make these epic ass parade rolls I really like these some people can't roll as well as others so if you want a nice big fat joint for a special occasion sometimes it's hard to do so this company literally allows you to make a cone like the raw cones but these ones are way more bougie they come in these nice little tubes so they have one that looks like a hundred dollar bill they have even fatter ones then they have the classic cannon which is the one that we're gonna be smoking today personally this is my favorite size out of all the ones they make I really like that it comes with a wood tip I really like just the amount of wheat that fits in it it's about 3 grams maybe 4 I didn't actually scale it out but without further ado I said you spark this up [Music] I put live breath and keep on the outside of it oh yeah that keep his burden I really love the size of these joints bed they are [ __ ] huge so on the video where I cut open a $50 pre-roll I said that I could make one myself for less money and a couple of you guys told me to do it so that's what I'm doing in this video I stuffed Durbin poison flour in this joint there's sour tangi live resin coated on the outside and then I rolled that Keef we keep this bird away faster than the actual bug but I'm not too concerned as of now the Durbin poison flower that I put in here was gifted to me by my buddy he grew it himself and like I'm really picky about weed but I gotta say this dude's Durbin poison was like out of this world I truly appreciate it you know who you are bro thank you very much free weed is always the best weed especially when it's good [Music] I got a radio this very second guys like I said in the pre-roll video I think it concentrates and Keith belong on the inside of the joint but I wanted to actually recreate that $50 role so that's why I put it on the outside it's definitely wasteful like there's way more smoke coming out of this and a normal joint and that smoke that could be going in your lungs let me show you a little close to finish you can see the oil actually melting down I put it decent amount of live resin on the outside of this whoo it's just got me shaking dude this is the first day of smoke today I'm lit oh my god guys this thing is ripping so hard for those of you guys who don't follow me on snapchat you probably don't know I just had surgery on my nose I had a deviated septum so basically I couldn't breathe well through it so for the last week I've just been recovering and man holy [ __ ] like my collar ins went down so much good I didn't smoke normally I don't take tolerance breaks but in the situation I was like bucket let me just not really smoke a like one edible one day but ultimately my collar ins went down with a block time dude the flavor oh this is so good the sour tangi library is mixed with the Durbin poison it's just a super [ __ ] fruity medley of deliciousness when the key that's a nice touch to my Keef is like all PA dispensary medical weed Keef so it's like some delicious fire beautiful Keef this is definitely better than the pre-roll in the $50.00 pre-roll video just because I know the weed was fresher the oil was live resin not co2 oil and the kief was definitely like better keep a lot of the dispensary chief I just know it's just shitty Keef that's why it's so cheap versus like when you actually get Keef from your weed and your grinder like there's no Keef better than homemade Keef [ __ ] yo oh okay you hit guys your turn ritual toks I'm so glad to be boomer the surgery and pretty much recovered with a deviated septum I couldn't really breathe well through my nose it was like breathing through a coffee straw instead of like a McDonald's straw if I was congested at all I just like naturally could not breathe so I got the procedure it's a septoplasty and annoyed ectomy I honestly don't even really know what the procedure is like I just was like cooled up do what you got to do but now that that process is over I'm back to smoking and I not gonna lie guys I missed it like there's no withdrawal really from not smoking for me like the worst thing is like I can't sleep well that's like really the biggest issue with me when I don't smoke I am totally not too profitable and able to sleep like I smoke so much I should date myself basically by the end of the night I remember my entire childhood growing up I would never be able to fall asleep when it was bedtime like I would always land that for an hour - just trying to fall asleep I think that's why I started to like weed when I started smoking it so I was like oh my first time smoking weed I got so [ __ ] stoned you guys like mids and heads was like the two options back then and like people around me all smoked mids but for whatever reason this day that I decided to agree with these guys they had heads and before we didn't get back to the skatepark I am so [ __ ] stoned like I remember getting out of the car and walking back to the skate park and being like holy [ __ ] I've never experienced anything like this like I was just giggling colors were more vibrant and I just like everything was just funny and I was like in love with the feeling but what my mom picked me up and I got back home I remember I literally fell asleep in our living room like half on the Ottoman half on the couch and like my stomach was just like in like the open air between it like it literally was just like based out of sleep for some reason they just thought it had like a long day at the skate park and didn't say anything about it but how the stones [ __ ] once I got past the keep you guys and the oil it has just had a really nice slow even burn you see that notice bro can do French inhales all day now no problem buy one of these for yourself and just stuffing it with weed is so much cheaper than buying pre-rolls from the dispensary and then you know it's actually inside it even if the pre-roll is out the dispensaries were recently priced usually there's just [ __ ] mids in there so it's nice being able to stuff your own fire weed in there and there's only being like thirty bucks instead of fifty dollars to 100 bucks but seriously if you think about it this cone was like two bucks say an eight the weed is like $25 I maybe put like ten dollars worth of live resin on it which is really really stretching it so we're at like 35 bucks and then like keep this free but let's say five bucks forty dollars for something that is literally twice the size and twice the experience of what that $50 pre-roll was not in California not trying to be a hater on pre-rolls I just like I always would smoke them and I'd be like these are kind of shitty and now that I've like broken a couple it open did the science I'm just like yeah welcome I'd rather stuff my own getting rough I love the wood tip though you can just rip the [ __ ] out of it and it has that black and milds okay green and spicy vibe to it and I just like it so much more I forgot to actually have this one though this is probably their coolest kit they got they put you down for a second it comes with two in one two he comes with this giant cannon I think I felt like five grams and the last one I put in this and then it comes with another one tip cone pretty much like the one I'm smoking right now let me know if you want to see another mini of me doing something like this with these also I'm going to Colorado so you guys so expect a couple more Colorado videos coming up let me know if there's any products you want me to check out while I'm out there or if there's any strain specifically you want me to pick up or any companies you want me to try one thing I do definitely want to find is some like sauce cartridges or just some sort of cartridges with some crazy consistencies because I know there's a lot out there okay I'm so done I definitely just [ __ ] my day up especially now that I just don't really have a good tolerance getting towards the end here you guys hope you guys enjoyed this video click like if you did subscribe for more to make sure you follow me everywhere else specifically snapchat I'm always posting over there let me know if there's any videos you want to see in the future I always love you guys ideas look oh that hurt yeah this thing is like getting so hot so recipe I think we're calling it a trap there you guys thank you so much for watching fighting this Jeff peace", "ZoPIzj4mPBw": "hey how you guys doing today on the Canada suspected so basically I'm making a YouTube video comparing the different dispensaries here in Florida and the flowers and the dispensaries this is the flower I currently get right here this is some prep then I'm currently smoking on not from a dispensary pretty good great pretty good smoke so I went over to the dispensary continent it's a new dispensary over loops they have a couple here Florida over here Florida it's not legal for recreational cannabis it's still medical so you have to get your license I went over to the cannabis stop right there on lutes they're pretty friendly it comes out to about 195 for $30 for the appointment and once you see file to see the doctor then you gotta pay a certified registration fee to the state to get your ID it came in ten business days it takes five to ten business days mine came exactly in ten business days it was pretty quick they email all your information so as soon as you get the email you're able to go to the dispensary right away they didn't have any flour so I wasn't able to get flour today because if it kind of thrown the virus situation everybody's stocking up so I got me some drops the $40 for the drops and he's gone under your tongue and then I was able to get me two different roll-ups one is rainbow trainwreck which she told me was a sativa hybrid and then the other one was sham hood which is an indica hybrid they're both for Grandma piece there were twelve dollars for the roll-up she gave me a twenty five percent discount so I got a little cheaper so we're gonna go ahead and try it out see you'll be sending credit into everyone I have now so here we go with the trainwreck high-grade hoji in there that's pretty good the prices are still low expensive at the dispensaries they have different tiers so basically Tier one would be a whole big bud like this F and there's $50 which is like high school prices and then they have tier 2 which is basically smaller buds broken up buds and that was $40 and then tier tree tier tree which is popcorn bugs little small bugs like that for 35 dollars so it's still a little expensive let's see how good the quality of the flowers here so this is the rainbow train wreck I'm trying out right now it tastes pretty good but wonder coughing I'm a little sick so a couple shoutouts I want to shout out describe some podcasts on Facebook if you like MMA definitely check them out he has an Instagram page don't have that right now and once they do the official podcast I'll let you guys know also if you're in the Chicago area check out this does end in glass and vape over in River go Grove Illinois they have all your smoking needs there the owner actually makes custom pieces so you definitely want to check them out here's some hot [ __ ] over there the phone number there is seven seven three four one eight three four four eight alright so check them out definitely still smoking this [ __ ] taking my time listening music hopefully they she gave me real high almost done I smoked all my [ __ ] I'm gonna smoke the whole G feel decent feel pretty good is it better than some of the [ __ ] I get yeah is it the best I've ever tried we'll see I'll give me another review in about five minutes when I'm done wife you tried it out she's still over there coughing but she's not really a smoker so pretty good i smoke joints I normally smoke about a gram of joint and to be honest with you sometimes I got a roll up right after I smoke one so so far feeling pretty nice you know my chill I'll go play some Madden in a minute you know relax is gonna go I'm gonna grade the flour from a 1 to 5 you know 5 being like damn I should fire one being like that straight garbage give me a couple more minutes I'll be able to give you a grade on this on the train wreck and then I definitely try the other one later I'll be on the same video I'll just obviously edit it and I'll let you know how that is also all done with that G I'm gonna even notice the rolling up at actually could move a little spot move nice spot friendly they answered all my questions it was pretty quick once you have your everything is done through the DMV so once you have your medical once you're approved they just run your license at your state ID and and they have you in the system so you know basically she did a quick profile and he signed a couple of papers and then they took me back to the showroom I didn't get any videos of the spot but definitely next time I go through our X permission and see the video it was all the prices definitely it was pretty good I'm gonna try the champ I'll give you out with you in the same video second video now reviewing the first joint I initially gave it a four on the review but I honestly have to wait a little while and see enough X's I really want to give it a three I mean initially it gave me a good high at first but then I wore down pretty quick in between that was a few hours ago in between I tried the the drops here you put them underneath your tongue for five to ten seconds before you swallow now you know you get two doesn't really have a measurement but you pretty much put as much as you need all you want I tried them a little bit but I was smoking in between I worked out so I really didn't get the effect so I'll give you but a review on it later I think I need to use a little bit more my talents is the little hard so now I'm gonna try the indica hybrid which is called I'm sorry I said earlier in the video the indica highway right here we're gonna try it out see how it is I'll give you a review on it now to be honest for you for the prices I wouldn't spend money by the a for a quarter from the dispensary on the quality if you already you're already getting good flower is alright one thing I can say about the pre rose and mold is that they've I'm pretty consistent so that's a good thing I like that but it's pretty even don't have the problem with that so they're doing a good job with packing these feels about halfway through it it's alright I'm not really feeling it too much I feel a little bit tastes all right smooth smooth is smooth though that's all I can say about it really I see I'll give it a few more minutes but you guys know but usually I should be feeling a little Sun at least the chill part you know but man yet we'll see what so any of the copyrights any of the music playing in

carousel bran tara sulk in menomonee falls wisconsin so so yeah i like this delta 8 because it makes me feel it makes me have uh it makes me it's it's an aphrodisiac for me yeah so i like to still to eat and it's great for sexual pleasure you know i don't want to get into the details but too into detail but it does so oops i dropped an action so yeah it's the i know if i told you this in my last video of delton smoking a dalton eight joint but it was more of a body high not head high so yeah it's you get high differently but it's not the same as weed you're not overwhelming hotly high so so yeah it's a great high and you still you don't have the paranoia and or anxiety that you do with the delta nine where you're not saying you know this someone is out to get me or somebody staring at me or whatever but it's you're getting definitely getting the health benefits of the delta nine", "lnnPHdnKKuI": "so here we have some raw cones classic raw cones uh authentic purist natural fibers unrefined natural unrefined rolling papers one and a quarter inch size these are probably my favorite things to smoke now i've never been particularly good at uh rolling joints um so i've got the same thing here uh raw rolling papers um that i could roll into a joint i'm just not great at it i find that a lot of my smoke product falls out of it and that i always end up rolling it unevenly and i don't get the best smoke experience i know that there are people out there that are fantastic at rolling joints i'm just not one of them and i think that i'm probably an average roller so when raw created these cones at first i really didn't know what they were all about but now that i do uh they are my favorite go to so if i pull a little tab here we'll see in here are six of these uh rolling papers these raw cones they come with a packing tool and they've already got filter tips in there i love filter tips you can buy filter tips separately raw tips where you just roll them up yourself but with these cones they're already in there so it's the same thing as rolling a joint these are the same papers that you would use you don't have to add the filter tip but instead of rolling these you pack them and what i'm going to do here is show you how to go about packing a cone so here let me set this aside we're going to need this and what i'm going to show you right here this is finely ground up tobacco this is pretty necessary you got to grind it up finely i use a grinder it's got a magnetic top you can simply push the tobacco leaf into the grinder you spin it back and forth the teeth eat it up there are little holes down there for you for it to drop through and this is a multi-chambered grinder so it falls through onto the screen here and i can continue to sift through and you can get some finer things down below in these lower chambers here but i've already ground it off and i'm going to show you just how easy this is this takes absolutely no rolling skills whatsoever you simply take the paper you pick up the tobacco and you drop in a little bit just to get started now you take the packing tool and you use it to push it down here to the very end add a little bit and yeah these are for tobacco use only now i pack it in pretty tightly but not super tight again you need air to flow through so the issue i always have with joints when i roll them is that some parts are just more tightly packed than others and air doesn't flow through the right way but with these i never have a bad smoke experience at all especially with the filter tip here at the bottom it goes a long way now i still love joints don't get me wrong and i know that there are people that can whip them up you know without even really looking at them i've watched people roll some amazing cannons and have a whole conversation with somebody else and seeing people do it driving down the road though that's not recommended keep your eyes on the road you can't text and drive then you shouldn't be rolling and driving that only makes sense okay so look at i've got it pretty well packed in here probably fit a little bit more in there on the top but you can see that and now all i'm going to do is push the papers together and give it a little twist what do i have here i have something that looks a lot like a pre-roll if you ever walk into a dispensary you can buy these pre-rolls so cones give you the ability to make your own pre-rolls and end up having a perfect little joint that'll smoke really well it's got kind of a canonical shape you can see that and that is the raw cones i highly recommend them", "e_SyivTcaDE": "konnichiwa RSO SOS a and today with our [ __ ] Japanese ain't we let's nuke them wails there's eat the quails as have egg on toast we know what we love

well if we check on the side here a sativa dominant strain night owl and the thing you really want to pay attention to here is this is 20 hashish and 80 percent out of focus this is 20 concentrated cannabis is what i'm trying to tell you this stuff is hella strong that's why they call it hella dank in the first place anywho uh this stuff is great uh and this is what these these are little half gram joints now you might be ah half gram joint this [ __ ] is hella strong i'm telling you i smoked about a quarter of this and i had to take a break yes tiny shiny little crystals that you see on the surface of the plant and they contain so many cannabinoids and terpenes that strong pungent smell that you associate with marijuana that's coming from the trichomes they take that and they create a concentrate from it the the design is hella cool the product is hella [ __ ] strong and i hella recommended", "UYTfwvzN9hs": "all right everybody hello welcome back to another video with token Tim

broke it apart to hopefully get a little more out of it there's some on the paper so plus I'm not a big fan the cones I don't like sucking on the cardboard at the end that makes my lips a little drier

Tim 420 this is a Florida medical marijuana review for medical cannabis patients or those over the age of 18 likes I hide all the new subscribers again if you haven't subscribed hit that button up there remember it's free makes me happy let's get into it we got some flour you've probably read the description I bought some pre-rolls this last 35 days flour recommendation you see I got all those eight-percent ones from liberty so I had a half a gram left so Terra has half grams so I got a original glue now I will say I do like their labeling 2421 percent THC it has the percent and the milligrams which a lot of them switch over to the milligrams when they hit the CBD and stuff like that so it's got point zero eight percent CBD CBD in it's kind of hard on the roll CBD C and it also lists the terpenes my believe rice also did that so this has mercy limonene pine anine something what all those things say but it shows the percentage in the milligrams it also says what it is let's get into this one they will look at that flower haul for the week or not elite but little half grams I'm gonna break this open because I really don't like the dark brown papers I think they have a little cardboard taste it's hard for me to taste the flower and I know some of you watching who watch and pay attention are gonna say the Tim I thought you didn't like the glue I'm really not a fan of the glue but the gorilla glue or the original glue whichever one you want to call it has a distinct flavor so I figured to be able to tell what this was that was a good one to go by because you can definitely taste it tell if the taste is they are not on a gorilla glue it doesn't have you know a real light taste the only other choices was star dog which I like the star dog can sometimes have that light orange undertone and it's hard to taste it sometimes so take a close-up on that real quick you can tell it smells like glue for sure you take a close-up of the cell yeah I'm not seeing a lot of discoloration or different colors like you would if it was uh had more leaves and stuff like that it looks like it's pretty much bad or you know ground up but I ain't gonna make a very good big joint but we'll be able to get a good taste on it let's get lighter yep that's a gorilla glue yeah I'd say that was good not too dry not too wet now I did ask him when they was gonna get you know like eighths of flour and I said probably not till like November I think she said she said they didn't want to roll out a product and not be able to keep it on the shelves so that means you should be able to go any time and get a seven dollar half gram free roll but now when you add that up that makes it come out to on the like $50 an eighth or over so this is on the higher end about time to get a new leftover bag Dana guys it's getting nasty so I usually throw all the roaches and the leftover and mix it all up so it'll definitely need a new one so I only have one more eighth left or this is my last eight I had one more until next Tuesday on the sixth so I don't have anything else but one-night stand in the wicket space and I don't have a lot of those left either so liberties is usually a little drier and it's also 28 so I figured I'd get that and I'll mix it in with my leftovers all my roaches and stuff like that but she don't look too bad this time still got some leaves and stuff I mean it's not great-looking but I have definitely seen worse looking bud see some crystals and stuff on there doesn't smell too bad so yes she's not too bad so like I said I'll probably just throw that in with all my roaches cuz I usually smoke wax joints so can't just break those up they're usually too little to resume and stuff I gotta need something mixed with so I can't wait til mmm so terror comes out with their hates hopefully it's a little more reasonable in price but that's not bad it tastes like it yeah not bad not overly yeah it is kind of like I said I'm not a fan of the girl glue taste but it is a very very distinctive those of you who have it or I've tried it knows it's a very unique flavor so having tried it before I knew it was what I could really tell if they was up to par or not on it alright that was seven minutes guys trying to get another video out tomorrow if you guys haven't subscribed make sure you subscribe and keep on token my friends", "Kqkl_obhg-M":

semi-gloomy day it just stopped raining so we're gonna get out and try to do a walk to the park so this pup here can get some exercise and me too so i'll be checking back in in a little while yeah literally just stopped raining and it's a little chilly out here so we are going to try to make this quick welcome back everyone happy monday morning i'm so glad you decided to stop by and join me and thank you again for all your support um i did not put out a video this past saturday it would have been a um meal prep video i was not feeling it and i had so many leftovers i want to just cycle through so more than likely we'll be cooking within the next couple days and of course i will take you along with me um and also we just been dealing with some things you know um health issues and all of that so there is a doctor's appointment today and just keep us in your prayers um you know life throws you some punches and you just gotta roll with them so i'm going to get into my numbers and i've already took the pup for a walk and i have work i need to get done so we're just going to roll here we go i already have my meal pulled together so what i did was i took an egg and i added some seasonings to it i had a little bit of salmon left so i broke the salmon up with it and i had a slice of bacon i blended all back together and then cooked it for a breakfast sandwich so the buns i'm using today is from um california country girl i've talked about her before really really good clean ingredients so um that's what happened i'm having a breakfast sandwich and i also have my coffee so that's gonna do it for my first part so i need to get to work and i'll be checking in a little bit later see you then okay guys i am back and this is going to be a very small haul from sprouts so let me get started i have right here a head of cauliflower because that um loaded mashed cauliflower was such a big hit um i have two bell peppers that i'm going to use i have red and i have green um i have some low carb bread that i found um someone else in my house eats this it's and i tasted a piece it is really good i think i saw mary taquito try this and this it is a really good bread um let's see carbonart so i have one nice ginger um i make a little bit of a ginger tonic for my tummy have some coconut milk and i have also some oh yeah well turned upside down sorry one is light and the oven is a regular coconut milk i have some oh sorry my finger got in the way clam chowder and it's dairy free so the ingredients are really good for this let's see i have some um hot sauce i was watching um i think her name is um gosh nicole burgess and she uses this nut butter she says it's really good she drizzles it over her low carb toast she loves it so i'm gonna give it a try there's no peanuts in it i found this um little guy i'm gonna try it it looks like it's gonna be really good and it's dairy free i also found this little guy dairy free too the ingredients are not shabby it has stevia so and you guys i found these cookies by siete now they are more on the paleo side of things but these cookies are so bomb yes i've already had some they are so bomb and the ingredients are not really bad i mean none of the ingredients are bad in their stuff so um and i know this is not going to focus for me to to show it but um it does have sugar it has a little bit of um coconut sugar and powdered sugar but it's further down on a list and it's just let's see not that much yeah not bad at all only six rounds so yep this is what i have and i got let's see for these the green free one they have a mexican wedding shortbread and a chip mexican chocolate when i say these are really good it may not be for everybody um you can like i said look up the ingredients and everything it it may or may not fit into your diet i had some it did not bother me at all now what i have what i also did today and i don't do often and you guys know that qdoba or any fast food but i went to qdoba because it was right there by sprouts and i've never been to a cudova before um this is so good um and it smells amazing it actually is cauliflower so they have it where you can get cauliflower a cauliflower bowl they call it a low carb bowl and we're going to be trying it out a little bit later because i'm anxious i said it was good because it smells good so we're going to be trying it out and yeah this is just my little itty bitty haul [Music] so i'm going to check back in a little bit later and we're going to do a taste test all right guys this is what the bowl looks like let's pick through it it has some veggies and it has the cauliflower under there it's more like a cauliflower mash i'll show you there's no cheese or anything i told them no cheese so here we go um and this chicken this is really good okay you guys head on over to cordoba this is amazing really tasty yummy yummy yummy a little keto bite very good all right so i'm gonna eat this and we'll be back all right guys i am back to wrap it up for a monday but before i do that morna this is for you i found them and they are so good so good now i didn't look at let me see yeah it has some stuff in it but i eat less than a serving maybe twice a week so i've had these this bag for a while and i totally forgot to show it to you but they are very good um with that being said let's see i'm gonna wrap things up tomorrow i don't know if i'll show it or not but i want to make some of my keto cereal and that cinnamon roll um non-dairy milk i showed you would make a good hot cereal so we'll see i might just make it with you guys we'll see um what else not a whole lot going on work is really busy picking back up as things open up and yay for that so but still you guys out there just be careful um so i talked about when i did get my vaccination the first one um so with the one that i got the visor so it protects you and that if you should catch covet at least it shouldn't kill you or send you to the hospital now i think i've talked about this before what's i think is a really good benefit of it another benefit of course is if you have it you cannot transmit it now just because i get this shot does not mean i'm going to go out there my second shot and acting all crazy and business as usual it would be somewhat business as usual but i still will be maxed up and taking care of myself just because i got my shots don't mean i want to catch it does not mean i want to be sick i don't like being sick i am the worst patient in the world because i'm so used to taking care of others and for someone to take care of me that kills me in fact that that kills me so just something to think about and people like oh herd immunity blah blah blah just like you get your flu shot you don't want to catch the flu it's still freaking awful so just be careful out there guys i'm not saying don't live your life but just be mindful and with that being said i'm signing off we'll pick it back up tomorrow so yeah we'll just make a cereal tomorrow we'll make it together um yeah see you then bye you guys well happy monday you guys no it's tuesday what am i saying happy tuesday welcome back to the vlog we are at the park it's a nice sunny day and actually not too chilly so we are going to get our walk-on and get this day going really pretty today super super pretty okay welcome back to my vlog um we took the pup for a walk this morning and let's get into my numbers it's late it's about 11 16 so let's do this and i'm not glare sorry so those are the numbers i'm working with and i do have my first meal ready to go i know it looks weird so what it is is some broccoli slaw i mixed in some of those um power greens a little bit um and one cooked egg a serving of cabbage cheese and i'm also going to have if you remember this from yesterday where i did my um little itty bitty haul from sprouts so i'm gonna have this with it and i'm calling that meal number one um i'm gonna try my best to track everything today it's that's a struggle that is a struggle for me i haven't tracked in probably a good year and going back to it i started trying to and just failed so i'm back to tracking today trying and we'll see how that goes um get myself back into the habit of it way measuring tracking and all that good stuff so i'm going to eat get back to work and um we're going to do a little bit of cooking today so i will see you in a bit when i start cooking all right we're getting ready to do our hot cereal and um because i just never remember measurements i have a little piece of paper a little piece of paper right here i'm just going to be taking a little bit of those as we go so let's see we have our measuring cup you can't really see the measuring cup let's see sorry about that we have a measuring cup we have some stuff stuff here that we're going to use um and as we go we're going to measure hopefully measure some things out and um see just um what the macros will turn out to be um so let's get going let me turn my um first let me open up some things because every time i turn on my um scale if you don't use it right away it turns itself off so let's just some things we just go ahead and open up all right so first thing what i'm going to do is i'm going to use some of you saw this in my haul and it says for a serving 236 milliliters which is 236 grams it's the same thing so let me get my scale on and let's do this okay we're almost there there we go okay so we got one serving of the um let me write this down the my keto milk so which is eight ounces so we got that so we can get that out of the way next we have some of the lactose free um carb master milk and i need to use this up that's why i'm using it let's see what it says here a serving for this is 240 so i'm gonna um zero that out so we can see what 240 looks like okay there we are okay we have that now i'm gonna zero it out again and what i'm gonna do oops um i think i have them you know me we are going to go in with the turmeric and i guess because i've been using it for so long probably with a good two years i don't really taste it too much i have to use a ton of it to taste it so i'm just gonna go ahead and add some in and i'm going to help to activate it i will go ahead and put a little bit of pepper now for me none of this bothers me for some people it'd be like oh this is gross but for me like i said i've been doing this for so long it's it's like breathing believe me so i'm going to also go in with some cinnamon sorry cinnamon here i'm not measuring any of this this stuff here so put a nice amount because i love cinnamon there we go now zero out again so what i am going to go ahead and do now is add some iso pure whey protein and i've seen thomas de lauer use this and i've already had it and i've used this um to make truffles so let's see what a serving is it's 29 grams so we're gonna go ahead and put um a whole lot so let me get in there and see and we're going to try to get 29 grams of it let's see here okay okay that's 16. two okay 25 uh oh now we're down to a little bit let's see if we can do this yay perfect perfection okay so we've added our eyeshadows zero that out and write down how much we use that way i can recreate this without any hassle the isopure we have um ah there are zero carbs in there and we have as far as protein goes wow that's a good amount of protein 25 grams of protein and we don't have any fat okay on to our next one we're going to come in with this for now it's a keto and company um hot cereal plain and i've seen this in the stores and i've seen they have an i think it's apple flavored i think that's what it is so let's just look at this um a serving is 20 grams and that would be 50 calories and how much fat 3 grams of fat 12 carbs 9 fibers and 3 proteins so let's get this written down that would be so okay so we're going to try to get the exact 20 grams okay let's see what this is gonna get us i'm sorry about the buzzing so sorry i'm hold on guys okay guys i'm back sorry about that and we're back to our next ingredient okay so we're going to go in with some hemp hearts and let's see a serving 30 grams so let's get it ready for the 30 grams okay just a little bit more perfection 30 grams um next let's um zero it out let's load our chia seeds and a serving is 30 grams of this muscle so let's get this going okay almost just a little bit more there we go i'm not gonna even try it's 29 but we're not going to try to go for that one okay get that closed up the final one is going to be let's zero it out again and let's see a serving of 13 grams and we're going to get this skirt up to see how water it is and depending on how watery it is we will be adding some more stuff to it so let's go ahead with let's see it said 13. okay almost there we go 13. okay let me grab something and i should already had it to stir this up okay let's zero it out and stir this around and see what we got here how about yeah how thick it is because i like a nice thick cereal um okay let me look at our ingredients see where we are as far as protein um let's see we are at let's say 25 35 40 46 okay so because this is going to make two servings and this whole thing is about 46 grams what we need is just to kind of thicken it up so what i'm going to do just to give it a little bit of thickness is add a little bit of psyllium powder and we don't need much ceiling powder because um we don't want it to be too thick because a little bit goes a long way so this is like half of a um tablespoon so we're going to add that in and i'm gonna find two containers to divvy it up in and that would be that and then we'll refrigerate it for overnight and depending on what it tastes like in the morning i'll probably add a little bit of sweetener or something to it but it's ready this is ready that's how i do my hot cereal so hold on let me go find two jars to um divide it into all right i'm going to divide them up in these two jars and it goes in the refrigerator and that is actually it um i'm trying to put everything into my fitness pal then i will know exactly um the macros for it so that is how i do my hot cereal and stay tuned we are going to be making some chicken meatballs see you in a minute we are going to make some chicken meatballs now this is a relatively very small package so however many it makes i'm just going to let's see let's get this opened up and um hold on let's get this package opened all right so we have our meat in our jar right here is our spice mix so of course turmeric pepper salt um a little bit of greek seasoning a little bit of italian spices and that's it so we're going to just make sure this is stirred up really well and we're just going to make some little balls we'll see how big we can make them because this is not a huge package of it but it should make an okay amount all right okay let me get the seasoning nice and incorporated it smells so good i love the smell of italian spices now i am going to take this bowl and add a little bit of water so i can wet my fingers and we're going to roll these up okay we have a little bit of water right here and i'm going to wet my hands and i'm not sure how big i'm going to make these but let's see maybe something like that and with my hand other hand so let's get it into a ball and however many they make is what we are going to have so i'm not being precise it's whatever okay i will be back once i got them on here and then we'll be getting them into the oven at 350 degrees all right here they are and they ate so we're gonna put these in the oven 350 till they're done and i will see you then so guys i finally put the my keto hot cereal into my fitness pal and it makes two servings so you see that what the calories are for it not bad and the macros are not bad either a nice whopping healthy some healthy fat in there and protein and fiber so this is what it comes out to is seven through the ingredients again the macros all right guys i am back so let's talk about my steps for today um let's see where are they and yesterday i think i did about 6 000 and something i can't remember so that's my steps um the meatballs turned out perfect i already bagged them up oh shoot here they are and i have my last meal for today i have my vegetable mix i have a hamburger patty with some mayo and sugar-free ketchup and i'm calling that good except for more water um i am preparing some more loaded cauliflower mash i didn't show that because i just made it with you guys it was such a hit in my house so i'm making it again um i'm trying of think if there's any more updates but tomorrow we have to go into the office so i'll take you guys with me but there's not a whole lot going on so i am going to eat try to get a little bit more water in me it's pretty late but i'll see what i can squeeze in and i'm gonna hit the snack because i gotta get up and actually go into my office that's a lot farther away so i want to thank you guys and we're going to pick this up tomorrow and see you then good morning everyone welcome back happy wednesday i've already taken the pup for his walk so we're going to get um it is what time is it 906. so we're going to get right into my numbers we're going to head off to work hopefully get back have some breakfast and just keep rolling from there so let me show you my numbers for this morning okay and oops let's see so those are the numbers and we're going to be heading right out to um get to work so i'm not going to the office that's closest to me this one i'm going to my main office is a little further away and the sucky part is that the main way you get there the um the bridge is down for um reconstruction so it's rerouting everyone and that is such a hassle the traffic is such a mess but we're gonna deal with it we're gonna go get back um get back into work we're gonna get some breakfast and all that fun stuff so yeah i will be checking back in a little bit later all right i'm back we are back from the office we're gonna finally do our first meal and we are late with our first meal it is a quarter to one so let's do this we are going to break into one of our um hot cereals so i showed you guys how i made that earlier and we're going to have some toast along with it and this is just the um california country girls um rolls and i just toasted them and put a little butter that's it so we're gonna eat i'm gonna get back to work i'll be checking in later all right everyone i am back and we're down to the final mill for today um because i don't want to forget just take a look at our steps see what we're doing here are the steps and i'll probably get more in but i just don't want to forget to show you guys um where i'm at so far um so this is the final meal right here is my cauliflower mash it looks different only because on top i use cheddar cheese this time under it is my vegetable mix i have some marinated mushrooms and i have two of the um the chicken meatballs and that's what i'm calling good and yes i did have to make another pan of the unloaded cauliflower mash that is so freaking amazing you have to make it but i'm going to sign off here try to get this video uploaded and see you guys in the next video thank you guys so much for watching", "Sh21IFve18Q": "hey there it's steve from serious keto and in this video we are gonna make a keto hummus with one-third the net carbs of traditional chickpea hummus a couple of weeks ago i was approached by a small startup called aviate foods all they do is lupini lately it seems that lupin lupin flour ground lupine beans or lupini has been kind of a hot topic in the keto world and for good reason first off very very low net carbs for example these lupini flakes which i'm going to use in this video in one quarter cup you have 11 grams of total carbohydrates of that 10 grams is dietary fiber so just one gram of net carbs per quarter cup not only is lupini keto friendly i've actually read an article that says it may help improve type 2 diabetes so bonus there the problem is that most of the lupine flower or lupine flower that i've used so far has got sort of a earthy even bitter sort of an edge to it enough so that you need to cut it with some other sort of flour almond flour coconut flour etc not so with this stuff from aviate foods i don't know what particular variety of lupini beans these are where they're sourced any of that stuff but what i can tell you is both the flour and the flakes have virtually none of that bitterness that you usually find in lupine or lupini now one very important note before we get going if you have a peanut allergy you should not eat lupini beans they are very close cousins on the food scale so if you have an issue with peanuts lupini is not for you as always the printable recipe along with all macros will be linked to down in the description below now let's make some hummus we will start with three cups of water that is 710 mil well then add one quarter teaspoon of baking soda this not only further reduces any slight bitterness that there might be in the lupini it also makes it easier to blend later on we'll bring this to a boil and stir in our baking soda once we've reached a boil we'll add our lupini flakes one cup or 120 grams we'll boil our lupini flakes for three to four minutes if it looks like it's going to foam over you may want to reduce the heat just a little bit but we're going to want to stir constantly i'm using a 1.5 quart saucepan here and i'm kind of pushing my luck i'm right near the edge after about four minutes that foam is going to die down we'll turn off our heat and then strain our lupine through a fine mesh strainer we'll then let it cool while we prep some of our other ingredients for this recipe we will use the juice of one lemon you can use fresh lemon or bottled but if using fresh you can also take that zest off of it and use it a little bit later as a garnish i use my microplane upside down like this so that i can collect all the zest it's a lot cleaner that way we'll set the lemon aside for later and scoop our zest down into a bowl see how tidy that is and we'll save that for later too for this recipe you can use either jarred minced garlic or fresh garlic we're going to use fresh we'll crush them a little bit with the side of a knife that helps the skin come off and then i cut off the little ends here the stem ends then we'll thinly slice both cloves and set these aside for later we will dump our mostly drained lupini flakes into a food processor then we will add the juice of our lemon if using bottled lemon juice i would say two to three tablespoons that's 30 to 45 mil depending on how citrusy you like your hummus next we will add one third of a cup or about 80 grams of tahini now i found that some brands of tahini can be a little bit bitter i'll talk about how to counter that at the end of this video also any tools that i use including this variable measuring cup i will link to down in the description below scrape this off right here next we will add 2 tablespoons or about 30 ml of extra virgin olive oil we'll then add our garlic either two cloves or one teaspoon minced one quarter teaspoon of smoked paprika and then we're going to add some cumin you can either use seed or ground if ground use one quarter teaspoon we're going to use seed but we're going to grind it up in a mortar and pestle one quarter teaspoon along with one teaspoon of kosher salt now if you like cumin you are gonna love the smell of this it takes about a minute to grind it up but it really unleashes an incredible incredible smell and flavor and we will dump that into our food processor get every last bit of it here and scrape off that stuff off that little center bit now we will process this for 30 seconds and then scrape down the sides to this we will add one quarter cup of ice cold water and we will process again for about another 30 seconds once again scrape down the sides then we're going to give this a little bit of a taste if you find that there's any sort of residual bitterness either from the tahini or from the lupini you can counter that with five to ten drops of liquid stevia i find that this doesn't taste very bitter to me so i'm just gonna put in i don't know four or five drops and one final time we will process for another 30 seconds look at how smooth that is we will transfer this to a bowl at this point the hummus may still seem a little bit soupy don't worry about that it's going to firm right up once we refrigerate this for about a half an hour that's where it's going to go right now after a half hour you can see how this is firmed up quite a bit so now we're going to garnish it there are pretty much infinite possibilities for garnishing whether you want to do roasted pine nuts feta cheese i'm going to start with a little bit of paprika here then i'm going to sprinkle on a little bit of ground cumin some parsley flake for color then i've got that lemon zest from before which will give this a little more color as well as a citrus brightness and finally i'll drizzle it with a little more extra virgin olive oil now you can serve this with one of my keto cracker recipes or celery which is what i'm going to do you know you could probably do pork rinds too if you want but i'm doing celery now i'll tell you i have made this with both the pre-minced jarred garlic and the fresh garlic fresh garlic really brings the garlic so if you're not so into garlic and you're using fresh maybe dial back to just one clove and in terms of the spices and herbs and garnishes on this you can absolutely make this recipe your own have some fun with it i tell you what why don't we see what my grandson colton thinks of hummus get some hummus for you give that a try what's that face i am definitely going to be doing a lot more with these lupini flakes as well as the lupini flour from av8 foods in terms of the flakes i think something like granola would be pretty doable probably even an oatmeal cookie who knows maybe you could cook this up sort of to be like oatmeal i'm not sure but i'm gonna try as for the flour i have used it already to make some chocolate chip cookies and some peanut butter cookies that were just stellar and all i used was the lupini flower now usually with the lupini flower i find i can only do about 25 percent of that as lupini or lupin flower and then it just starts getting that bitter earthy sort of taste to it not so with this i used 100 lupini the cookies were great so in the weeks ahead look for more recipes with me using the sloopini flour and lupini flakes i will include a link down below in

smoke in the blanks and more paper per so I might like like my joints more anyway sometimes it's cool problem is because have tobacco I'm not only can smoke this or I can't I don't want smoke simply that but anyway I already filled up one because you know before this take time and that here we go we have handed some diesel haze inside that you see look almost the same in the blonde it's no really big difference it's okay maybe it's a little more smooth on the side outside and color its little like more darkest it's a little tobacco blunts anyway here we go we see now how work you know how we can and it's been good or or whatever I'll go quick oh [ __ ] hell go really that in the almost bland people doesn't know my blonde I think it's quite slow then what is cool hmm oh yeah that I say

company loud pack and it is a hybrid sweet earthy and fruity one hundred and sixty eight eighty milligrams THC is 18% CBDs just take a look at the standard warnings and they're beautiful packaging and there is their information there I am I'm gonna pull this little sticker off because I want to see a lot of these companies are companies and companies and companies [Music] don't want to just see there we go there's the name of the farm that it's farmed at and just want to give everybody their props because the amount of work that goes into growing processing I've done it and it is a lot of work so I don't know how to pronounce pronunciate that pronounce that but that is the farm that it comes from all right should we pop this thing open and see how their pre-rolls look so it's good it has a seal on the top but with no perforations to get it open so here oh my gosh I feel so dumb not mean I'm gonna open these sometimes all right got that started pop it open this is a Graham cool little they have their own tip and this was $13 so plus again state taxes local taxes county taxes let's get a good shot of this or yeah all right thanks for watching [Music]", "qL5JJK5hsJM": "[Music] hey everybody i'm here with tristan's day and uh we're at the facility here in silly avenue clearwater today we're going to be demonstrating what we're our up-and-coming product about pre-rolls um we got some sour space candy that's been sound like crazy it's delicious and very mild for us people are getting a lot of good reviews on it so i'm gonna let kristen take it away and show you the process that we're gonna do to make a perfect hemp uh pre-roll yeah we're gonna have my special this weekend right yeah i believe so awesome all right take it away all right so here we have just some basic shake with a little bit of extra nugs in there what i'm gonna do first off is kind of just pour this into this container see what we have in terms of larger nugs and then i got our latoya 3d printed prototype grinder here i'm going to just use a this a little bit on some of these bigger pieces this thing does pretty well not grinding it up too much within a good fluffy feeling in the butt great for pre-rolls and so on a lot of this is uh pretty well done so don't have to worry too much that's pretty well i think yeah now this fancy little machine uh help of some nice pre-rolls here we just kind of grab one of these and slip it into each one of these holes but uh after we get these all filled up we pour this guy in here and turn on this little shaker pad that we have underneath and it does most of the work for us now that all of these guys are all snug inside you can see them even at the bottom there poking very nicely all right kind of just push things a little bit down with this little peg give it a little bit more space oops i lost it all right all nice and snug you take this guy here this big old plate of beautiful stuff just pour it straight on in i want to make a mess here and they gave us this nice handy-dandy little card take that and first just spread around in the first layer yeah we'll see how it looks here oh wow got most of those bigger guys smash it down and we twist the top that's pretty simple huh well that was our first attempt what i liked is that you didn't crush your buds up too much because really in a pre-roll it seems like they always use the worst shake in the worst part of the bud we're going to try to keep the consistency of the hemp real nice so it's going to smoke good like this is going to smoke real well oh yeah so we're going to do a little special this weekend anything you buy over 50 bucks we'll give you a free pre-roll and this sour space candy i'm telling you it's delicious remember your aunt was here yesterday oh yeah and we had it we all shared a hemp joint late in the day d.a and uh it was delicious and calming everybody enjoyed it you know so even if you're a marijuana smoker yeah it does taste good you're not bad for your first run no so check us out on toy.com [Music] [Applause]", "E8MqwmazFqY": "hey guys what's up my name is Manning this is recreational 4/20 and today we're gonna check out a watermelon flavored infused pre-roll by mr. twister the strain on it is I'm not really sure this it says purple TW which could mean purple trainwreck but since they don't say it literally anywhere else on this package I have no idea what strain this is that's kind of frustrating just because I don't know what strain I'm smoking other than purple TW which could be anything I tried looking it up but I couldn't find anything so I'm gonna go ahead and just move on the total THC well THC comes in at 24.95 I can't tell you if that's the total it says total here but without providing me the THC a number I really can't verify that for myself so I kind of just have to assume that this is what it is so with that I'm gonna go ahead and pop these guys open it's been snowing up here so bad alright so at first glance is this things not the prettiest and I don't see how that bends really bad I don't like how loose it is so you kind of have to like repack it on your own I know I told you guys before when it comes to pre-rolls me my girlfriend typically especially with these infused ones because the way they infuse them is they like smoke the oil back into the bud it's a weird way they do it but when they do it kind of makes it to where like if this doesn't burn even from the start you're just gonna canoe really bad and lose like a bunch of this stuff so we just snip it and throw little chunks into bowls and smoke it that way as far as smell goes this is an infused pre-roll so it smells just like watermelon like straight-up I'm excited to try it just because I love watermelon but yeah I'm gonna go ahead and we're gonna try this tonight and I'll let you guys know how it goes tomorrow so I went ahead and tried that Mister Twister watermelon infused pre-roll and it was pretty good the way I said like we empty our J's or our pre rolls into our bowls when we did that we noticed that there was a lot of like a lot of stems a lot of like dark sticky butt and it kinda almost looked like tobacco I know it wasn't it's just the way that cannabis looks after it's been infused through the liquid hash or whatever their method is so that was the the way it looks oh it wasn't very visually appealing not to me anyway and then when you're smoking it out of a bong it has a really sweet like watermelon flavor on the inhale but then it I I can't compare the taste to anything other than I Swisher if you and me personally I don't like Swisher's I don't like blunts per se so the flavor wasn't like my personal favor but if he likes if you like the flavor of blunts and you want that flavor with that like the tobacco effects are like the tobacco being inside of your wrap then um these guys are a really really really good alternative to that where you're still gonna get the flavor and you're gonna get really really hot because it's infused with oils so it's not really like the cannabis isn't what's making you high it's all the oil that they infused into it um it tastes hurt anyway so that was a taste and then as far as the actual high it was more of like it was a mostly heady mostly heady high like your body was fine you it was you've been completely functionable but it was more motivational uplifting like a talkative high so to speak without the yeah without the couch locky effects so yeah for as far as a pre-rolls go this is pretty good I mean the flavor isn't my favorite but the flavor isn't the only thing that decides whether I buy something or not anyway so this has been a review of mr. twisters watermelon infused pre-roll my name is Manny this is recreational 420 and I hope you guys get a chance to check it out", "cuBJxV1-oJQ": "[Music] so [Music] you [Music]", "Sr63mwCcnTo": "[Music] what's going on youtube it's your boy turpy

the numbers i will read the effects off uh the effects and the help it helps a reduction in anxiety it's uplifting giggly helps with seizures uh and it helps you focus and it helps the depression okay i'm sure it's a lot more but i didn't do too too much homework on this i've had this for a while and i just want to try it because it's three awesome [ __ ] strains in one uh and it's from g leaf and you see i got my dab top dead time shirt on john and i sit right there so we gonna get it poppin y'all you know i'm gonna do it and a little different today because i'm actually outside on my front

nice flavor [Music] a real nice flavor nice and fruity so i got a buddy covered over here that's what i'm actually sitting outside to wait for but i figure i'm sitting outside waiting for my mind to do a quick little review and smoke a pre-roll right pocket and uh this one is is uh definitely good like i said this one helps seizures now i haven't read up on on many cannabis uh many strains that that actually specifies on helping seizures so that's pretty cool even though i don't have seizures never have knocked on wood hopefully i never do but yeah i mean that's pretty cool so [Music] it is it is a sativa dominant all right still earlier in the day so it is what it is you know what i mean i got nice and white dead ashes hope everybody had a good weekend man i really do hopefully everybody's being safe to stay medicated it's the entirety y'all saying like always right this has a uh a really nice sweet uh fruity taste to it to be honest with you and i really i remember a pineapple express like having that pineapple a sweet flavor but as in the other ones like train wreckage space queen i don't think i've had them like specific strains like you know what i mean like yeah so oh by the way i picked up a gram of uh of uh durbin poison too so be on the lookout for that i don't know if i'm a presser or if i'm just gonna smoke it so well i remember i just did the review for it for the uh the concentrate right the the butter by grassroots so yes i was like man this is really good it's in my top uh my top favorites in a sativa category so i figured go ahead and get a cream of the bud and see how i like the bud and if i like it if it's still there i'll go ahead and pick up an eighth of it or even a quarter you know what i mean and i also got a quarter of uh bruce i mean not a quarter an eighth of bruce banner so be on a lookout for that one too they're upstairs as i would show you but i don't have a mom [Music] hopefully you guys enjoyed this review with this quick little fast review of this pre-roll i'm going ahead and hop off and uh actually enjoy it yeah definitely worth it go pick them up i think it's 14 bucks for a gram 16 bucks per gram you know

a package from Berkshire I don't know what's in it we bought the find out together you know that's weird hope it wasn't opened no tape on it oh-ho nice they got my little tag there that's pretty cool from us to you enjoy appreciate how y'all doing it's Friday I'm excited this Friday we got a package in the mail make my weekend great all right so let's see what's in here oh wow Hey oh we got two of them and we got a sticker smells great I could smell that already soon as that smell soon as I got ripped open I smell see what we got here sweet sweet I noticed a law enforcement authorities did that down I like that Thanks look hard all right I'll see what we got here hmm lifter total CBD is gonna be 13-point 62 what else we got on here hmm dieudonn\u00e9 doom doom cbda 15% and this is for the sour space candy sour space candies in 1397 CBD CBD a is 15 point 37 though and I think on this other one the CBD a was 1488 I like those numbers I think too much CBD just turns into a sleep fest I don't I don't like it to overpower the other cannabinoids some people like a really really really high CBD I don't I find that that's not really necessary and a super haze pre-roll I see people cut these open just kind of spells like spice like spicy not giving it to me I don't quite know we'll see all right sour space candy all right slow cured and hand trimmed and lab tested sour lemon grass and diesel I feel like the Sour Diesel is definitely the stronger notes not getting really any sweet from this but I'm definitely getting Sour Diesel now super sour though not as sour as Cascadia blooms see what she looks like big on looks now all right so I'm smiling hey it's hard not to smile when you get something that looks like that put there you go well trimmed that looks good nice thick nug so let's see we're gonna take this small we're gonna crack it oh yeah it smells uh you get a lot more of that sour smell when you crack it open I like that one I like sour face candy and that one feels good and I could tell you just from putting my hands on it it's got a nice sticky so let's see I have read something that said a good cure would be something where you want to be able to push your thumb in it it should go in but it should retract and that's but that's kind of what I'm getting there it doesn't crush is dry yeah it looks nice it looks very nice very nice now I've got I'll try a lot of lifters I probably got more lifters in my box than anything and that's a lifter lifter is it's like the more and more I keep smelling lifters it's like a savory berry almost like I smell berry but there's like this funky cheesy undertone and that's kind of what I'm starting to recognize from lifter that's lifter and this definitely definitely is lifter they just they all have this uh this feeling of just this stickiness to them that I'm really liking and that's a nice high quality bud look at that that's pretty well trimmed well trimmed man all right I'm actually excited to try this stuff so you know what what do we gonna try it and you guys will hear the verdict be right back all right guys I'm back and we're gonna go ahead and talk about this lifter in this our space candy and this super Hays pre roll we'll talk about the super haze pre-roll first I haven't had too many pre rolls this one had a strange kind of like clover like smell not quite sure but I've never had a super haze before so it could just be the way the super hey smells I'm just not familiar with it but what I will say is it was very smooth I don't smoke too much I bake mainly it was very smooth it was very good tasting and it definitely gave me a head change as far as what was in it man that's hard to say man I can't sit there and cut that open and look at it and give you a any good or bad feelings towards it because I don't know it's like cut up so small it could be flour it could be trimmed you know I don't really know so I didn't cut it open I just smoked it and it was smooth good taste and good effects I mean I'm not gonna be buying pre-rolls just cuz I like having the flower so unfortunately my opinion on this just isn't too complex it was good I enjoyed it these two on the other hand so what I will say that I noticed right off the bat was the flower was moist but it's still cracked when you pop it in half it's still crack even though the flower itself is I want to say cured very well you know just because it it gave this feeling of a fully cured flower but it didn't feel dry neither it it seemed to still have some some moisture in it and so let's see other than that part of the Cure as far as the smell is concerned thus our space candy was not as loud as I would have hoped for but I by any means is that a bad product but at the same time no matter how many times I let it sit in this jar and crack it open it just didn't hit me in the face with that sour sour face candy when you grind it up it really comes alive you know and you start getting those sour notes but you know I guess each curing process has its own ups and downs but for me I personally like it when you burst open just the jar lid itself and it really comes alive not actually you know it the way it smelled when I was grinding it that's the way I wanted it to smell when I opened up the container the lifter I've never really found a super-loud lifter so it really didn't bother me that this wasn't SuperDuper loud but out of the two strains I did prefer the lifter I felt like it put me more where I wanted to be I like something that's a little I found this to be a little more intense a little more potent towards my liking the lifter was good same-same cure as a sour space candy and it did have that real berry funk cheese and it came through in the smoke as well both of these came through in the smoke very very well like this I could taste like a cheesy berry it lingered and the sour face candy it was floral but still yet sour space candy which I thought that was so awesome the very first toke I get on this and the vaporizer is pretty pretty cool because it's got both of those in it normally this our space candy when you toke it you wanted to just that's our space candy the same way it smells the same way it tastes this was different it was different but the lifter the lifter was more potent for me and that's why I got down with it they both broke down very very well the only other things I would say is I'm not a fan of the little bags you know because they always smush the flour I think that the flour would have been in better shape had been in some kind of a jar or a bigger bag that doesn't over Tom smoosh it or a bag that's designed more of a triangle that'll really stop it from getting smushed that would be the only negative thing I would say about the way it was packaged but overall great product I would highly recommend this product y'all have a good night", "CG9xX4u8jGs": "[Music] what's up YouTube chef Hans here bringing you another adult only CBD and cannabis product review let's have some fun guys get right into it today we're talking about Vance global alright guys so this is a pre-roll review and these pre rolls are the cigarette style so it's got the cotton filter tip just like cigarette I did a previous review on a similar product with a different company but this is me its global okay here's the packaging so it's kind of like a cigarette pack you know you open it up CBD Vance global all natural blend that's what it says right there now it says organic hemp flour and organic herbs so right away is telling me that there's not just hemp in this it's more than that there's organic herbs in it it says it's a 10 pack and there's one hundred milligrams of CBD per Vance is what they call them the Vance pre-rolls so on the back please recycle is what it says and it says our goal advanced global is to create the best quality product using all natural ingredients we strive for perfection and have created something you know you can trust from all of us here we would like to say thank you Vance global now it says on the side for ingredients okay this is important organic CBD flour natural flavoring organic herbs now I don't know what kind of natural flavoring is in this but I tend unless it's like terpenes or something like cannabis Dr terpenes but I usually don't like additives and things especially stuff when it comes to my hemp but anyways let's talk about the product so you open it up check them out there they're black the the the filter tip is black it's kind of like a kinda like a raw paper type Brown kind of like a hemp paper and then we'll bring it down close so you can see it but you can tell alright you smell the hemp but there's one distinct thing the use of lt's it smells like lavender okay which is different so there's lavender in here guys lavender flowers in here mixed with with hemp that's different man that's is different so we're going to go ahead will bring you down clothes will let you see it up close then we'll smoke it we'll come back we'll tell you about the effects what we think about it but Vance global here it is let's go down low now alright guys so I want to bring you up close so much a look at this pre-roll Vance Global pre-roll look at the inside you can see the lavender right in there I see that and there so there's hemp in there there's the lavender and then it's just kind of like a raw paper kind of like oh yeah raw paper or something like that but this is some crazy smoke guys crazy crazy smoke we'll go back and tell you about the effects here in a little bit there it is the Vance Global pre-roll you know cigarette style they got the cotton filter tip it just really tastes like lavender that's all you can really pace it's supposed to be that discreet type of way of you know it smells better and it it just tastes like lavender and then afterwards you kind of got this like lavender scent and then also like a taste and your sinuses and stuff it's very lavender and I'm not sure how I feel about it yet it's I don't know I haven't figured out how I feel about it it's kind of different it's a little weird and I'm not huge on fruity smelling stuff like that so we'll come back with you and tell you about the effects and how we feel about that lavender what Vance global there it is so all in all guys this product from Vance global is pretty cool it's it's a different product for sure it's something it's supposed to mask the smell of the ham so it's more of like a concealed way or clandestine way of medicating here's how I feel about the effects the effects were pretty decent you got a decent effect off of it I just do not like the taste and the after take Sally so now it's lavender I'm not very fruity kind of flowery floral kind of guy I just don't like now some some people will like this though I'm sure there's a lot of people you especially if you're watching this you'll like this it's different it's so different it's cool product I'm not saying there's anything bad about just me personally my opinion I don't like the lavender because it is extreme lavender and after where you smoke it like it's all in your sinuses and it's just like lavender you know and that's cool we do you know use the scent lavender central oils here at the house and stuff and I like the smell but when you're smoking it it's just it's different

the cannabis club got some fire stuff coming in so definitely we're gonna check that out we don't let you guys let you guys decide whether or not you buy it tasty joins oh man tasty dude they're [ __ ] fine huh yeah I hate that [ __ ] don't hit it come on for the camera died he's gonna die oh damn shot at the audience that's only necessary is it I think that was the cherry was that is that the cherry see this was chair there's this big book that won't kind of taste like cherry but so it kind of tastes like tastes like ketchup ketchup now we just say it's burnt maybe that's the cherry down lit gotta wanted to back on it too but definitely into damn I never had my card let him rip tater chip don't let it get a little bit of a button Oh mom that's it killed me eyes are watering goddamn huh", "WQhvM48E9UE": "okay cool so here it is the presidential the world's strongest pre-roll according to these people I mean that's pretty bold claim considering that this is clocking in at fourteen point four five percent I have a feeling that something that you know eighty-year-old like a hash hole kind of rule probably tops that a little bit but uh and probably a little bit stronger but whatever let's go ahead and see what's in this bad boy all right so comes in a protective container that's good and boom there it is just a normal-looking J down the background here let's nip this up so it's supposed to have flour honey oil and Keith which probably means that it is dark as hell all right oh and look at that weak as [ __ ] at the end right there alright snip this let's get in here alright there it is popping out the top already come on now there it is tiny bit left in there but that's pretty much the entire roll jeez Louise all right all right let's see what we got here zoom in all right so it's very dark I can't really tell anything about what this herb is I see tiny stems that seems to be pretty common no massive lumber so I mean unfortunately that's a plus for pre-rolls I'm gonna get a smell on this it does have a weird like kind of sweet scent to it even though this is not a a flavored presidential they probably original is probably some kind of flavor I guess but this is it yeah it just has maybe like a smell like kief I don't know like shitty Keith it doesn't smell like anything great is as dark as hell it's I mean I guess this is weed but this is like coffee grounded down nothing I would be super stoked on smoking nothing I would death I mean this was $19 dude okay so think about an eight that you can get for $19 do you think that you could get an eight that's a better quality than this I mean I would hope so I think honestly if you went to a shop and bought an old pal Aitor and you ground it up it would look better than this you know and okay yeah so this is soaked in honey oil and there's some Keith in there or whatever but I don't know it's this for for $20 this is what you're getting you know this is the privilege this is what you have the privilege of smoking for $20 so take that for what it's worth let's go ahead and get it on the scale and get this puffed up over here try to get this little tiny bit now cuz I guess this is supposed to be a gram but honestly like what would you pay for a gram of this quality you know like at a sash on like a random table if you saw like a bag of shake that looked like this you know and they were like oh it's got honey or the one keeping it what would you pay for it you know I don't know I mean I don't know if I would even put my money on it that's the thing so that's that's what you're looking at that's what's inside let me go ahead and zero this out just go in here okay and it's coming out to one point one so there you go one point one and I know this is now in a green container so probably makes it even look better but ya know crazy things like huge stems and all that in this gut but uh just you gotta ask yourself are you okay with paying $19 $20 to smoke this that's a question only you can answer", "13HncRPekb8": "the biggest scent that's ever existed it's like a satin Snuggie but a lot of people just call me flip and on this channel we smoke we talk about we products and just kind of chill that sounds like something he'd be into hit that subscribe button it's located right here and in the last video you saw me roll up six cones at once if you missed that [ __ ] I'll leave a link to it right here but basically we use the raw six-shooter to fill six king-sized cones at the same [ __ ] time what did I do with those six cones I put them in a wallet specifically designed for cones but before we get into that let's light one of those six comes up there's five left and I'm gonna burn the tip of this off real quick and Cheers [Music] [Music] okay so a while ago you may have noticed we did a video that you're probably thinking I've seen this video already I've seen him do a wallet for weed well this isn't a lottery this is specifically a wallet for pre-rolled [ __ ] cones if you do want to see the the weed wallet the wallet I'll leave a link to it right here but this video is different say you're going out and you don't feel like bringing your weed and your papers and your tips and a lighter and all the other [ __ ] you can put in or wallet don't worry I got you and this one out already because I've been talking so much so you're going out you're going out with your friends you're going to a party you're going to a [ __ ] concert I don't [ __ ] know all right but you don't want to bring a bunch of buds and [ __ ] rolling papers and a tray maybe or [ __ ] tips and I'm like you don't like bringing all that [ __ ] you want to bring one thing but you also want to be able to smoke multiple [ __ ] times I got your [ __ ] back this is the raw creep wallet that's what it's called it's called the raw pretty Rowlett because it's for pre-rolls it's smell proof I think it's smoked through as far as humans go probably not as far as dogs go dog would probably able to find this knocking on line uh I always say that just to cover my own ass because the last thing I don't want well not the last thing I don't want the last thing I want is one of you guys know poof that I brought in the car and they brought the canines and I told them it was okay and blah blah blah and you got arrested I'll do that humans won't be able to smell this dog's wool it does have ain't like a smell proof seal around the zipper but this is literally just laying nice like a hardshell [ __ ] case for your free rolls and you unzip it like this and you can so you can fit a surprising amount in here like I'd say probably eight combs you can fit eight if you do it like this I put a blader in here too but that's how I have mine set up I have the four cones right here on the bottom I got you know staggered facing different directions a bit more will fit in there if you do it the other way you probably about three have you just like face them all the same direction and I put a lighter up top but you can also like put four more cones up here if you wanted to and just take that out and they've got these little like [ __ ] elastic restraining bands in there so like whatever you put in there will [ __ ] stay in there and should and won't fall out so that's pretty dope and if I can put this [ __ ] lighter back in there we go it's just it's just like that and this is literally [ __ ] perfect it's perfect for like if you're going out somewhere anymore bring a couple [ __ ] comes with the a ure rolled up some cones it fits up to a king size so you shouldn't have any problems you can put one of the quarters in if you want and you just lock it all up there zip it up zip zippers a little a little sticky sometimes but or just like that and that's [ __ ] pre Rowlett [ __ ] Duke I recently found this I forget pretty sure it was on Amazon I get a lot of [ __ ] off Amazon just because the price point is [ __ ] ass thanks for the follow Xavier Sanchez good-looking sorry about that vibration though you just ruined everyone else's video I'm just kidding you're fine unfortunately the pre-roll it might not do do much good right now because we all have to stay inside and show but soon soon we'll be able to use your pre Rowlett and take it all the [ __ ] parties and impress your friends with it once again you guys will be able to go out singing hopefully if you're watching this after the corona pandemic that's [ __ ] dope welcome to the channel this is an old video honestly I try not to mention like current events that are happening in my videos just in case when you guys is watching this in the future and you're like I don't care about that anymore so that's why we just try to we try to keep [ __ ] like focused on the product focused on like our personal selves and [ __ ] like that just because you know past experiences and stuff like that so then like you know everyone can relate more in some better news we just passed the 900 sub mark [ __ ] doe I'm super excited that means relating this post to a stack and we're doing giveaways at all the 420 mark so the last giveaway was at 420 subs so we can't do the next giveaway unfortunately until 4.20 KS UPS once we hit 4.2 k subs will give something away I don't know what yet let me know what you guys want to get given away in the comments remember it can't be anything that you have to be a certain age to get because I don't feel like checking IDs out here so maybe like a t-shirt or a hat or something like that I don't [ __ ] know well figure it out we always do always meaning that one time that we did a giveaway so I did way back to the pre ramen that was the the [ __ ] pre-roll I think it runs for like 10 bucks so it's I mean it's a cheap vibe if you want to try to find it I think they run like obviously I might even been cheaper than that I think remember I picked it up like a month or so ago but I think it's a [ __ ] really cool little thing it's like it's not very big it's kind of small you can throw this in a pocket or in a backpack or anything like that yeah just you know keeps your cones in shape you know what I really hate and me and Danny actually talk about this all the time is when a [ __ ] pulls a perfectly rolled cone out of his [ __ ] pocket and there's like it's not bent or nothing and he's been walking around the whole [ __ ] movie or the whole TV show in like tight ass [ __ ] jeans for some reason and yet here he goes he just hears I got this [ __ ] cone perfectly rolled up with no [ __ ] creases in it or nothing it's just perfect and you know what that's some unrealistic [ __ ] no one [ __ ] does that maybe if your worst weapon that I can even see that no not even if you're wearing sweatpants you know what they should do they should pull this out of their [ __ ] pocket and then they should open it up and they should get a [ __ ] tongue out of here because then you can have a perfectly rolled phone there's not one of us and every [ __ ] stoner knows I know all of you [ __ ] agree with me if you've ever just put a [ __ ] J in your goddamn pocket and walked around all day what would that [ __ ] jail look like at the end of the day or blunt or whatever you're smoking what that should look like five hours later after you guys were just running from a group of [ __ ] people that we're trying to you know I mean you [ __ ] something up and they're trying to get you and you run out of the building and run down nine [ __ ] streets and you're all tired and you're like oh man at least I got this joint in my pocket please that [ __ ] would be [ __ ] up you'd have to leave all that whole thing and if you meet all inside a [ __ ] pocket all crummy in there and [ __ ] mixed in with your wallet [ __ ] so that's [ __ ] it's just a bunch of [ __ ] I'm actually gonna cut this video operating now I hope you guys enjoyed make sure you check out the free wallet if you're like Kerri enjoyed surroundings [ __ ] super helpful in the head and it's cheap but just ash taller to continue anyway condone forget to Like share comment subscribe they're all like big things I said them kind of in a weird order just now but it's whatever I'll see you all next time peace table look good for you guys and a [ __ ] just pulls like a perfectly roll what have you taken a few marijuana", "1KEwTnabU9E":

dope today because I kind of got a little jewel for you I have an interview that I recorded with Tommy Chong about a year ago roughly he came into my job and I ended up doing like a little recording and it's actually I'm talking about how him and she got their first record deal so I'm gonna do a little bit on this but I'm gonna get to that and let y'all watch that [ __ ] because I think it's pretty cool to be able to see to see a og legend like that you know just talking about how they got his [ __ ] deal so anyway before we do that though let's talk about the [ __ ] pre-roll here what I got is an indica today are you sleepy [ __ ] so you know I usually do the sativa so if I'm sleep today and [ __ ] it's gonna be y'all as well be out there sleep trying to mow the lawn and [ __ ] but uh nice oh this was pretty cool oh it's a 1.2 1.2 1.2 5 grams inside of the pre-roll it also has Keef inside of it now what they did with their Keith what I really like is they put the keith on the inside of the joint I [ __ ] hate when people put Keef on the outside of the joints so they put everything on the inside so that's like don't thing this one right here is that I think nineteen percent THC 23 total cannabinoids so that's good and uh let me see no let's see no pesticides it's lab tested and more important its Chong approved so let's see yeah I think I was about it Leticia and of course they say is premium flower don't nobody say I got shitty flowering here so let's get this [ __ ] lit up oh yeah man it's a interviewed I was a really dope interview so I'm gonna sound on it it's you know it was it was in a spot so it was kind of loud in there so you can hear them no enough you can hear them enough hmm I will say with these [ __ ] wrong choice man these [ __ ] are smooth as [ __ ] I love these shits ever I get a chance I always [ __ ] with one of these yeah man but what's his interview just [ __ ] kicked it with Tommy [ __ ] smoking volcano and [ __ ] like it was cool times but yeah he started talking about how he got this record deal and I thought that [ __ ] was pretty built so I thought I'd share it with y'all since I got the pre-roll it's a don't pre wrong I mean what else can you really say that [ __ ] sucks or dump his nut [ __ ] is nice so i'ma let y'all watch this other video I know it was very simple he had a showcase for Warner off in another that was [Music] we're rehearsing inside recorder now is he's been the carrier when he finally did a knock and we have the single V I have to come up with a bunch of Attraction given region in space I wanna hit the sea we in the jungle smoking we in a jungle smoking legal", "Yyh5mlUo64M": "all right what's up homies you may know me ATF videos right here chillin I'm in LA we're going to a wheat event it's kind of like a swamp me for cannabis super [ __ ] excited swap me for weed sounds better but just trying to keep it professional I don't know if I can film I've never filmed on one of these things before so I'm just gonna carry my camera on a tripod and I'm gonna hope people think like hey yeah this is just blogging and I don't get all problems but let's go you know let's check it out alright guys so right here it's way better than I'm going in a dispensary I mean look at this the pre-roll party took place Saturday September 21st in Los Angeles and vendors from all around the state came out to gather and show off their weed there's a swap meet for weed is the best way to describe it all there were artists painters food makers and some of the finest wheat in the state had stupid low prices I'm taka is stupid low you can get an eighth for twenty twenty-five dollars which if you go to dispensary you're talking way more than that but nonetheless you know I'm not trying to divert from the fact that these are kind of where more industry people gather where people who really are into the community come together because look at all that week you know I mean it's just everywhere people are gathering it it's a mix of a club a club vibe with music and food there was burritos there was an eating contest which in my personal opinion be there was no victory you'll see right now but all this weed here was amazing this was my favorite one of all nothing looked better than this particular strain weed vendor and there it is he just smoked her I'm sure I'm just gonna be honest I don't even know why they had her on there she was no chance but other than that yo it was a fun time and I think that everyone should take it check it out at least once this was a churro guy so yeah alright guys so let me walk this way because everyone got their lights on the vent was dope we was cheap a lot of good looking weed a lot of cool stuff it was southern I came for specifically they didn't have it but it's all good yeah and I do have all I have everything so yeah come to these they're fun they got good food the burritos wrong point [ __ ] they have vegan pizza that [ __ ] was crazy and it was [ __ ] put it in THC and all that [ __ ] in there so I was pretty cool they got punk-ass two cars and poof it was amazing but yeah I'm ready to go home go watch a movie go take a nap and make this video later guys I'm out", "rSO-dfv5YZM": "this rolling up to Lamar is certified by smoking on an extremely late blood right now that's inflamed for you bleep little spit boo tonight we're gonna be looking at a creek road cone so without further ado it's jumped in closer all right Burke up see those emojis drop down in comment section they're gonna be looking at wannabe cyclones right and this is a pre-roll transparent cone and this is chuh we've done another one of these and it was blue and it was still called chilled but the flavor of that one who was menthol other than that there's actually no kind of indication of flavor on this thing so why should I have to smell it to figure that out so first things I do take out pack alright so what you get is two cones clear clothes I don't really pick up no smell from back here what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put one back in here thinking it might be that same kind of McDonald smell but let's see all right um the smell of this is not mental it's actually kind of fruity and I'm not exactly sure whether it is like it is a berry I'm thinking that it might be cherry but it could also be like strawberry um it does smell good though Oh Londo is going to get this thing stuffed using the lean green wizard so just Glade all right we have these cyclones clear to filled up you can see the weed in there very nice smell is coming off the back of this red part is a very nice very smell again 100% if it's like berry or cherry strawberry you've tried to use let me know in the comment section what you think until there will be some fire on this thing you see how smooth I'm expecting smoke real good yeah see we think there's a blazing stuff see if we can identify the flake all right Berkeley sparking this thing up it is kind of short well I guess it's like it's supposed to be like the only smell is coming from this red part and just like they it's like a berry the rest of it doesn't smell like anything no go ahead get some fire on this and see the first cool you know what I get that kind of menthol you taste on it and there's also like some kind of fruit also but I also get that menthol taste kind of like too much taking the taste of the weed through the wheat doesn't even taste the same it's not Stanley get this little one side the whole thing that belt tasted the full it's terrible thing just like sits on fire like a candle - I don't I can't I don't like this menthol taste if you like menthol tasty how do you like these but I will say is gonna try anyway don't let me not liking it dissuade you from trying it so yeah you seem good with charts you made me wait like them more do not be [Music] don't got some good some good smoke intake go back just that smoke got that me taught a story that s is this is really black guys I'm aggressive this you can follow me on Instagram - Omar - it's a little Marty Facebook its who and where I live I'm get to go to a patriotic American burglar it's a burner for a pretty decent time don't Lee had that much value also take the Rose shadow cool because it's making me cough in the menthol taste and don't worry like but yeah geez I am still want each movie that to the my not very good [Music] you", "mCy37KOh25o": "okay cool so here we are in my thousandth post thought I'd do something a little different today and got this packwood's shout out to what's in my pre-roll for their inspiration such a simple concept with something so desperately needed in today's day and age so yeah this is legit Packwood's that I picked up it's prop 64 compliant not exactly sure what that means it does look like it is a normal blunt but I'm sure it's kind of like hemp wrap or something like that it doesn't exactly specify here on the packaging but as you can see it's got its holographic seal there it's got this wax but it's not real wax apparently and it's sealed by actual plastic so yeah let's go ahead and crack this thing open and see what we got looks like the dotted line is right here Packaging always gets the best of me all right cool all right so that came off pretty easily strip this does this just want to come off all right let's get the sticker going really self-conscious of my nails right now I definitely should have cut them but alright let's see oh there we go popping this off I guess this would be pretty problematic if it was actual wax oh that's just a screw top all right makes perfect sense plastic in there and there's what we're seeing from the top first a little preview there let's get this thing out of here no graceful way to really do this let's see there we go cool there it is it even has packwood's right there on the glass tip so yeah I mean looking decently keeped up guess that's the whole point this little guy escaped some like a little well let's just cut it open in reserved judgment here let's see if I can smell anything not really picking up on any Jack necessarily but it's probably just because it's overwhelmed by whatever this rap is made of got my little scissors out so here we go first cut definitely is stout whatever's in there oh damn oh no I was gonna try to patch this back together after this video but we'll see how that goes all right so there we go let's open it up get the focus on that alright well not exactly what you'd expect from their post on their Instagram page so you're getting at that looks like it'd be pretty hard to pull through falling apart pretty easily let's get a smell for this I mean it is looking fairly tricht yeah I'm not really picking up on any Jackson I know it's blackjack but I mean all the blackjack that I've ever smoked has just been predominantly Jack smelling it and I'm not really getting anything off of this let me grind it up a little bit that's what you this is what you're getting look tiny here let me get in here this is what you're getting I'm not shooting on this if you want to spend you know fifty sixty dollars to get this packed into you know keep tup want do it I mean I don't have a problem with that but that is what you're getting get you know it's ground up pretty well it's all smashed in there it's got some stems in it nothing no huge ones nothing like that I mean the note looks alright it's not anything amazing I see some perp in there but I'm sure I mean I'm not getting any smell off of my fingers at all which is kind of weird if anything maybe a little bit of sweetness but nothing jack like so that's what you get right there let's see what it comes out - oh wait you know there's a lot more there I mean not a lot more but there's more in here cut down a little more I'm saving this guy now is that it isn't where I'm at the tip there all right you guys couldn't see this but I'm trying to work it out it is just smashed in here look here so I mean maybe that would have smoked awesome laying here let me focus a little bit there we go so maybe that would it yeah it's like I don't know maybe that would have smoked great I don't think so [Music] I'll try to take a picture away in it cuz it's like honestly it's so caked in here I'd have to scoop it out so but yeah that's it that's what's inside right there you're looking at it pretty much all of it except for what's jammed right in there there's some Keef on the outside I don't know you know where the what is it co2 wax I guess maybe it's with in the nug like kind of blended in or maybe it's on the outside but honestly no Jackson it whatsoever and yeah I don't know that's what you get so if you want if you're cool with that and if you want to spend the kind of money to grab that then go for it but I mean I'd rather just grab something else and roll it myself there it is backwoods blackjack", "1B99DFuR0ik": "y'all without 4/20 fam GC ganja man I got this pre row from dying baguette I just picked up today never had none of that [ __ ] before so this is gonna be a first time for me we got a hybrid 24 karat gold is distrain otherwise known as kosher tangi and I've never had tangi by itself but I've had kosher cushion that should have some straight fire so one grand prix row man and i'm looking forward to it a dude actually gutted out the paper and [ __ ] you guys know i don't really smoke papers either man so i went on ahead and gutted out that pre row got some of it i rolled it up in the hand and went to spark it up just like that man so let's go wife you got the torch and [ __ ] I like that little ID right there but damn this [ __ ] tastes real good fam it's like a strong citrusy note and it says right here that it's citrus pine and diesel but I'm not really picking up much diesel or the pine like the citrus terpene on this [ __ ] is really dominating life but it's good though it's almost like a cup of orange juice or some [ __ ] it reminds me of like the zest of an orange pretty strong okay wait yeah so I'm picking up a little hint of the diesel but not so much pine like nah this is definitely more like citrusy and explain diesel like what does that mean it has like this gassy flavor to it if you will it's super dank and it's almost like it comes off almost like a smell or a taste of like gasoline like you mean yeah it's kind of hard to explain I'm not too sure if this [ __ ] is an indica or sativa it doesn't really tell me if you guys know drop that [ __ ] below put me on 24 karat gold or kosher tangi well I'm feeling pretty good man [ __ ] yeah it's really cerebral so far it definitely tastes like there's an orange in your mouth real talk like a like a cushy cup of orange juice yeah well yeah man I'm feeling pretty good really relaxed it's not so much body high though like I feel like it's real in the brain right now heavy on the my drizzling outside it's been raining like for a longest time already man it's kind of weird I like to think like the earth is like sad because of all this [ __ ] going on and it's like trying to heal itself but I gotta say like everything has been real quiet like the freeways the streets you know it's peaceful man I mean for the wrong reasons but I enjoy it dude is feeling very uplifted though like it's definitely a mood enhancer because I feel like I'm just in a great mood right now and I could literally just be like enjoying like some of the music or some good conversation or say watch a good movie or something yeah and we're trying to find something so bad so watch guys like what the [ __ ] are you guys watching right now because we are in a hole right now like I mean we got a few options but we're just not really committing tones because they're not grabbing our attention like that like for instance Westworld like I know that [ __ ] is pretty dope and I've seen like previews of the new [ __ ] because as far as we're concerned we're still like on the first season and it's moving kind of slow and I'm saying so it kind of like loses our interest a little bit I'm saying even though we know it's gonna be fires just like [ __ ] you know and what's like another one we've been wanting a homeland homeland like I've heard things about that I don't know like have you heard anything it just doesn't really look enticing you know saying it sometimes you got to give it time because you like gotta get used to the to the cast you know you got to develop relationships with the characters or [ __ ] so sometimes it takes a while but yeah man if you guys got any recommendations drop that [ __ ] below again we have Amazon Prime Hulu Netflix Disney Plus spectrum TV let us know man like how do we have all those [ __ ] streaming apps and don't have [ __ ] what a watch like oh no maybe we'll just have a peek I know but yeah guys I mean she 24 karat gold I'm not mad that [ __ ] is some fire it gives me such evil vibes I feel that it's a nice hybrid though like when it says hybrid like I feel that [ __ ] because I do start to feel it in my legs a little bit now I feel like it's a little bit of like a tingly like like not heavy but like numbing almost kind of hard to explain but I feel a good balance but if I'm wrong you guys correct me you know kind of gives me more sativa down many vibes though but yeah you like it baby how you feel mm-hmm that's what I like to hear but on that note guys we're about to take you back in the house cuz it's [ __ ] cold in here and we are [ __ ] wrecked right now so we're about to go in

bubble kush 98 which supposedly came out right before the whole y2k thing just said that i think 197 but i will tell you it has a nice sweet smell to it i can smell it i got a five pack of pre-rolls i can smell it through the the packaging and if you can and i'm going to tell you like this if the pre-roll smells you know some good flour because most pre-rolls smell like grass and ass but this smell good nice sweet smell to it taste wise more earthy kind of kind of gassy a little bit kind of earthy almost like almost like dirt but i get a bad weight can be a little bit of a rough smoke as you guys can tell but overall it does the job and it's a good feeling it's an indica but it's nice man i paid what was it i think 30 something i think 30 for the pack of five so not too bad it is what it is i just thought i'd get out here real quick just let y'all know what i'm smoking on let me know below in the comments what you're smoking on where you got it from even if you're out of state i mean

the strain reviews um as the budget's not there right now but i will say that in the meantime i might post some workout videos or i'm just vlogs or stuff like that in the meantime because just because this is a better water channel doesn't mean that's what we got to do all the time but b98 give it two thumbs up it's a mid to high kind of high but definitely definitely worth checking out if you're in the indica you know um so yeah like i said there might be a little break in the stream reviews um which is kind of good because i feel like i need a little bit of a tolerance break anyways because i'm flying through eighths like it's i'm clearing an eighth in about like two days so i definitely think it's time to chill out for a little bit you know i wouldn't mind if the [ __ ] wasn't so expensive but like you know anywhere between unless you're getting minis which are even hard to get down here because always sold out the minis are 27 and then it goes like 43 dollars and up and like

join here yes all right I gotta check my receipt here this is I thought there would be at least two in here well I was gonna rip it open and see how much it weighed and everything but I want to see how good the roll is how she burns so 0.7 so the filter is 0.25 to go it's got a little bit of a white ash doesn't taste good at all no this is this is a three out of ten its pre-rolled so I guess if you weren't able to roll your own joints but I don't even enjoy this it's a sativa yeah so there you have it I'm gonna in this video short I don't want to smoke the rest of this it's leaving like a

don't know tobacco in it and they're not addicting or anything but still they do wait why am i holding it like that the [ __ ] is going on J went out I probably am invested um if I was at a smoke session someone had this I was like yeah good this hemp joint right here you wanna hit it swing that my way I'll do that yeah I said that right there I took this last bit of this Jake some Mother's Day today I don't really I just was thinking deep or like kind of deep I was just like how is their Mother's Day like Mother's Day Father's Day like who was the person or group that was like all right guys today is Mother's Day let's celebrate and then everyone was like okay do you like I don't know how to do how did they catch on you know saying like this holiday was you know how did how did to make this holiday who would let it conclude holiday how did that come to be a normal thing for everybody man when 90% of the joints are old when I get to be small or the filters are to come undone man I'm not the best at rolling way I'll make sure it's at least smokeable and we go I don't have it loose loosey goose but I do it is good enough getting it for me I have a plan and I'm playing this make a website and put my videos on the air I have my clothes on there and then have a podcast on there so I wanna be like a website right and it's gonna have like different tabs on the website it's gonna like the clothes the podcast the stoner TV vlogs another time for something else then like I gave it my friends clothes or my friends vids stuff like that can make them a whole individual tab I could do ads and stuff like that so while a dream wildland but I could start getting started on it not me personally because I don't wanna code I can build a website for free but the guy that I bought my computer from he was saying how like them free website builders and them cheap website builders they're okay but they're not really professional they're not like you know they're not really website websites they're like T little web sites what's up Grimm sup gun um yeah so on there something I can code it out make sure it's designed perfectly and all that but it's gonna be like I don't have an exact price but I know it's gonna be between 800 and a thousand five hundred so that's website might be a thousand might be a little bit over a thousand might be a little bit under but it's a lot of money for me at the moment good job on a website they'd be like yeah do that that's like a couple weeks of like putting mine to this side and being like all right take it take all my last week's earnings think of all my last month figures I know but I'm like risk it I'm a risky guy cuz like all you need I'll not be thinking about is this only your only one idea away one idea away one hit away one thing away from get into the next level like you never know what idea of my hey which idea you had that you went through it that's gonna hit but everybody who don't do that it's gonna be thoughts in the future like what if I did that you never know if it don't work eh hey it's a lot of money lost but makes me try please be tried I would love to have like a website right I'm writing a car I want to have the license plate say like something cool like now I'll race a STONER TV they put over instantly well my license plate to be is misfit seven seven seven I really like that on my license plate or miss four seven at least wanted it to read you some comments while I smoke this last bit of J for the day for the day for the day for the day I'm okay okay okay all right she fixed you feel me I gotta be risk-takers in life the ristic is living on the edge that's a motto I live by living on the edge you gotta take risks risks it's a hard word to say cuz the way you set up I guess a SK than is risks like why did they set it up like that that's a risky as a word and oh my [ __ ] god so they made the word risk a risk because it's a hard word it's a hard word to say and it's like risky they were like this we're gonna work he's gonna catch on risks you already the beginning it is earlier with your tat say my fingers they catch life got that last February I hate hearing bugs they not bugs but like them flying but oh my god is right there hey what are you doing like you could fly anywhere but you chose here like is this chilling right daikyo like killer right never really wanted to do that I'm not gonna do that and one last thing before I head out I remember just a couple weeks ago I was making videos smoking out of a sprite bottle I didn't have a bong and money was rough like a dog [Music] sit there right there grab this doohickey leaflet Ron 3000 here we go all right well I normally keep my leaf inator in a bag so easy to transport but it's over here I forgot the science experiment dong looks like a science experiment person looks pretty clean it's loaded up after I finish this it's just like whew it's like gas smoke it's to the bone good smoke to this done um nice as bong thank you appreciate it oh I think this was only this was only 60 we're not only yes I feel a lot of money for a bong and my thinking like it's crazy I feel like honestly something like this it should be like it should be 20 like something like this should be like 20 like it's just a glass if you think about it like it's nothing special like snakes in the upgrade but looking to do you can't find it nowhere else and and then you can do is make it yourself and only we know how to blow glass or make glass some some we just came to filter that means I didn't roll it's a I didn't roll the side of the throats initiate oh damn but it's just done it's over with me two things are done Hey goodbye the last thing if anyone out there don't got any grass don't got any weed no money it's all good just know that it's only temporary now I'm taking this hit right here for you everything is temporary like everything everything like everything everything I haven't hit this bong and like honestly it's been like five days or more I just been waking up grind and come out as never really came out here to smoke it and the last times I did miss we're gonna just been the Jays like the joints I was really smoking out of a sprite bottle I mean hey I was really in the struggle I remember I would like try to conserve it so much like I was in my little slump and then I'm back but hey you never know it could go back down or go back up [ __ ] or not back up like upward the neighbor thought could go down but it could go up yeah I think like that yeah I think with could go up you know why would it go down you know I don't want it to go down again I'm gonna try to that to have that ever happened I'm gonna keep myself secure but [ __ ] it he's going up and this is going up - let's do it stunner TV three two one Cheers [Music] offering God that's why I don't smoke the bong anymore stuff like this um I got spit again I feel like I was sleeping and I was having my mouth open I was

joint roller I'm also not the fastest joint roller and I'm pretty lazy so these raw pre-rolled cones are my best friend I love raw papers and the cones are just so great because you don't have to be great at rolling they're just super fast and convenient the only thing I hate about them is stuffing them it's actually kind of difficult getting all the cannabis right into there until I pick something up this weekend and so I thought I would show you guys something that has been helping me out with loading these cummins they're all over it is just a little funnel that goes into the comb and a little card that you can use to collect all of your herb and yeah just places right into there and you just put your weed in and funnel it on down but it helps to get all the cannabis right into there so I thought I would do a little video showing the raw loader in action let's get this video started all right so have a nice snug of blueberry OG here I'm just gonna grind some of that up [Music] now that I have that ground up I'm just going to take the comb and place the funnel inside of the comb then I'm just going to add that ground up blueberry OG and then I'm going to use my dabber to poke this down into the comb like so it comes with the stick that is the perfect size to do this but I lost my stick and I cannot find it for the life of me so you can use a dabber or a pin or whatever you have to stuff it down just make sure that you get it nice and tightly packed see if it as you guys can see as I'm finishing off the joy and trying to push it in it's way easier to do with the loader [Music] and there you have the perfectly rolled joint that you didn't have to roll and it was super simple because of the loader but yeah that's the raw loader super simple but super useful it really does make pre filling these cones a lot easier and you can pick it up on Amazon for 749 I'll leave a link in the description of this video I which that's pretty cheap for like a little useful tool and this would be great little stocking stuffer or just a little gift for your stoner who you know loves these pre-rolled cones thank you guys so much for watching let's mark this up and I guess I'll be headed out of here see you guys around for whatever so any activity or video I come up with for next time bye guys [Music] [Music]", "NEWAbeBRMSM": "[Music] [Applause] [Music]

to sacrifice your your your cognitive state in a way that might you know hamper your work ability CBD actually has most of the same medicinal benefits of THC but just without the high and it's the medicinal stuff that is in a more concentrated form yes like you're not getting as much CBD yeah from traditional okay yes smoke so you got cannabis and you got him so cannabis is actually very strong very concentrated in THC a very low concentration of CBD industrial hemp is actually very high in CBD but very very low if not anything of THC so actually a lot of the CBD comes from industrial hemp it actually doesn't come from cannabis lucky for us and lucky for a lot of people that are that need the medicinal benefits of cannabis while CBD legality can vary from state to state CBD is not only legal in Missouri but it's also legal on a federal level they actually just passed a new farm bill that was an update from the 2014 farm bill completely removed it from the controlled substance act is it legal yes however do be smart about it this stuff especially our flour and our pre-rolled items do look a lot like the quote unquote real deal so I recommend that the customers leave that in the package until they arrive at their home if it does feel a little disjointed yeah studies have shown that CBD reduces pain inflammation anxiety depression migraines seizures IBS psychosis and mental disorders and nausea so thirdly how is CBD take it you have sublingual sublinguals are a quick way to get in your bloodstream usually just drops under the tongue topicals creams balms there's even patches that are great for muscle and joint pain then you have your pills pill form is great capsules really quick and easy way no hassle no frills way to take CBD then you have your edibles edibles are delicious there's all different kinds of edibles vape available form of CBD can be great for somebody who's already using an e-cig or already has a vaporizer that they're using on a daily basis and when it comes to flower we have the jars of loose flour we have the roll-your-own kit that has the filters and papers included and then we have the pre-roll we have regular pre-roll and then we actually have a Keith and honey rolled pre-roll concentrates concentrates include wax shatter crumble any sort of concentrated CBD isolates and CD is also pet safe there are specific products designed just for pets you could also take a sublingual that's meant for human consumption and give that in small doses to your pet either through their water or in their food meow the fourth thing is how much CBD do I take we always recommend in your starting dose you should usually start about 25 to 50 milligrams and then kind of go from there start a little smaller work your way up and just see what works for you it's not uncommon for people to take upwards of a hundred to two hundred you can't really overdose on CBD so take it you know if you want to start at a hundred start at one hundred if you think that's what you're gonna need one good thing to know if you are using any kind of sublinguals or anything like that with the dropper most droppers are one mill per dropper so you can figure out hey I've got a 30ml bottle it's got a thousand milligram of CBD and you just divide that a thousand by 30 mils and that's basically how much each dropper will be so the fifth and final thing that we're going to talk about will I pass my drug test with CBD yes you will however some CBD products do have trace amounts of THC in them the legal limit for CBD products is 0.3 percent or less THC a lot of the products that we carry are 100% CBD pure CBD or isolates isolated zvt if it says full spectrum that's where you get into that gray area where yeah I'd include something like that and the flower and and yes again it's very trace amounts but if you are using CBD on a regular basis at all I would recommend sticking with isolates and pure CBD and stay away from the flowers and the multi spectrums in the full spectrums now quality is a huge factor know where you're getting your stuff from know where your shops getting their stuff from if you're into CBD at all you know the names like green rose and fresh leaf and summit stuff like that that's what we carry so it's all lab tested most products aren't only just lab tested they're double and triple lab tested and keep in mind even if you're at the point three percent you're not gonna get high from it on the other hand if you're not getting drug tested the multi spectrums are fantastic they have what they call an entourage effect because you're getting all those camp cannabinoids to work together all that synergistic stuff going on aside just all they say all the harder right pretty role in the flower stuff it's some of the best stuff for anxiety and insomnia sleep disorder sleep IDI is an excellent way to go for for anxiety alright guys thank you so much for watching I am Steve this is Ian we are at 5-star vapor lounge

stars in richmond they were around six dollars each with tax let's see what's in the white bag all right so we've got west coast trees we've got a hybrid we've got a sativa and we've got an indica let's check out they look like they are from out of sacramento the distribution is there's the west coast trees let's get some information off the package this is a gelato 120 milligrams of thc at a 12 and cbd less than one percent a manufacturing package date price minus tax standard government warning here's your information on the distributor all right let's see what this company has to offer for pre-rolls all right and let's get this out of the way so you can see it's got it's pretty firmly packed and there's the tip and that tip all right let's break into this got a little ash tray right there all right so that's your green inside let's take a dry drag see how it tastes can't really get a dry drag out of it it's not too bad it doesn't have much flavor this is the gelato smoke it you can see the smoke is pretty taste yeah not the best let's see if we can get a shot of the er okay it's burning good getting drags off of it it's burning a little to the side all right i like to do the little pat test again because sometimes i don't smoke a gram all at once you can see it's kind of bendy when you do that it just means it's got like a weak spot in it there it's not fully packed it's not that it's not fully packed it's that it's got a gap in it all right so you can see it's a few more anyway it did break i always like to see if there's big chunks that come out as well if i try to put it out and relight it yeah it's just okay the taste is not that great gelato is gelato and you kind of know if you're smoking flour gelato or whatever they keep putting in these things i don't know i'm kind of disappointed in all of these pre-rolls except one but i can't tell you because it's like a hairdresser so won't be able to get in all right let's check out the west coast trees indica i'm gonna just break this one open for you to show you all right so you can kind of see we're getting a lot of stuff in the background let's get to focus there we go you can see i mean it's pretty well packed again that other one just had that little bump in it or that little gap in it [Music] so if you don't do this to your joints you're missing out can just be removed like that you can see it's like you can kind of see like the yellow flakes in it so you're definitely getting not full full flower in the pre-rolls you can see the little if you've ever grown or you can see the little yellow yellow ones all right so let's take a little dry drag of this i'm sorry i told it i am not getting any dry drags off of these but should still messed up okay so this one is the hybrid no i'm sorry this one's the indica the first one with the hybrid again the drag off of them perfect they're not packed too tight where you can't get a drag off of them it's pretty good let's put that out that one was out better you can see you get a get a little uneven burning on these [Applause] oh anyway okay okay so not my again not bad again for six dollars the bay areas prices are pretty high dollars a joint so oh and this one did not have a seal on it so that plastic seal was missing unless i took it off already which i don't think i did let's take a look at this one again packed packed pretty good let's take that end off i have to write on the on the tips of these of which ones they were um let's take a look at the packaging on this one this is the indica oh sativa sour watermelon 12 less than one percent i think it's all the same packaging let's see west coast we did and the indica i did the hybrid i believe already yeah there you go purple goo and i'm just not tasting so this one is the sour melon i'm hoping i taste a little bit of sour in this one there's the green okay so this one out of all of them probably taste the best and that is the sour melon sativa all right oh gosh there is that yes you're also not getting those little yellow leaves in that one so the yellow leaves was in the i think the indica i'll rewatch the video all right so let's smoke this one they could be burning uneven because i took a little bit out of the m but let me try to even it up see what happens [Laughter] my too many hits all in a row anyway back back to the show so that one tastes the best this one tastes the best um it's the sour sour melon so seven stars was the place that i bought them and west coast trees west coast trees with a z your sativa is good i would try to work on the other ones anyway that's my unboxing and review have a good one see you next time", "IPijNo6Ng_4": "I don't always roll joints but when I do it's usually an ankle that's why when I want to smoke a big fatty I reach for Cresco reserve stock [Music] [Applause] hey there welcome back I'm Dan and this is Dan's Buddha bodega where today we'll be going over crest goes new pre-rolls the shorties reserve stock today's strain is tangerine cush so without further ado let's get into indica from Cresco its lineage is tangerine haze in rare darkness number 1 so you put those together out comes three first thing that you're gonna notice when you purchase this product it's going to stink up anything so this is one to watch out you know if you're gonna have company this blew up my house and the thing is it was very sweet and very pleasant that's right it was very very pleasant I'm hoping that the smell and the taste correlate because if so this is gonna be awesome it's from their reserves so it's you know it's aged longer it's just treated a lot different so let's see if that the beautiful smell transfers over into smoke okay well normally I would use a very faint Wynonna's fancy cigarette holders you know but I don't have one I don't have a smoke stone either so here's what I do with my pre-rolls okay as long as they got a crush on him I like to go ahead put him right into my hitter and then I could pretend I'm really classy so there we go okay wow that's really good impressive cross cold mmm-hmm right off the bat we got citrus lots of citrus I'm talking lemons not just lemon pledge but I'm talking a lemon tree that's full of grapefruits oranges limes and on the exhale it's a little bit hot but I can live through it because of those Boger packets thank you very much Cresco keep that up now when it comes to the effects this reserve stock tangerine cush is amazing and I'd say it would be a perfect antidepressant it's very uplifting very very creative oh no little cerebral but it also gives you a bit of energy which is a little strange for an indica but if you're new to cannabis I could see how this might make you a little bit paranoid as far as the only other downside that I could see is dry mouth you know cottonmouth it you know pot lip yeah a little bit of that going on so have a drink ready hey before I forget I got a few questions for you guys number one is do you ever use cannabis as a painkiller and if you do what strain and my second question is is do you think people are ready for ketamine injections for people with mood disorders PTSD and severe depression I'd like to take a moment to thank all of my viewers subscribers all my friends over on Facebook followers on Twitter Instagram all of that you know you can find good and put both baggage on all of those venues again friends families you to viewers everybody thank you for so much great support you guys are the reason I do this and just to get some feedback would be awesome but just to have your watch it's good enough for me I'd like to thank fresco for making such a wonderful product and Midwest compassion Center for being such cool patient care representatives hey I

the coolest features around [Music] a built-in loading tool learn more at www.stonesmiths.ca [Music] who grew it what's the terpene profile who created it what is the lineage how much thc what's in a name this is know your buds a close-up look at cultivars you should try or try again joining dean is our educator chris ianson [Music] always great to catch up with my good friend chris ianson regional manager with plantlife cannabis i love our new music it's just a real grooving kind of uh way to get into this and it's a lot of fun so chris what's new with you guys i know you've probably had a pretty busy week uh another one another new one with plant life uh yeah dean totally uh it's been it's been go go go down here i've been down in uh southern alberta uh operating out of calgary but uh hitting up uh six six stores in the area here uh really getting to know the the plant life family um yeah it's been uh amazing uh everything's gone really well and uh i even uh um you know with the new store opening up too i'm uh super pumped that's that's gonna be happening soon too so uh yeah it's uh it's been real real awesome buddy that is excellent we'll tell you all about that store opening uh after we get through an absolutely delicious cultivar that we're looking at today uh this is cush mints we're talking about it's a 50 50 hybrid and this comes to us from quest and this is uh you know a very high-end uh cannabis uh that they produce so the parent company of quest is decibel so give us kind of the backstory of decibel and quest yeah for sure dean so uh the decibel cannabis company um formerly westleaf um and they did the switch in december of 2019. uh they're the parent company uh they were created in 2017 they put a serious focus on craftsmanship and a commitment to perfecting the process their cannabis brands are blendcraft quest and general admission vape carts which are some of my favs they're real tasty carts so all high-end high-quality cannabis and then they've also got a line of retail stores in saskatchewan and alberta called prairie records with a really cool focus on music that is awesome music and cannabis go great together i've got the uh the record up there as well from another lp so that is uh is an awesome focus to be able to pair those uh together and we we should point out quest is a is a higher end cannabis so if you are going to pick it up at your local plant life store you are going to pay a little bit more but as we're going to tell you as we go you're getting premium amazing cannabis and sometimes i get really excited as you know about like a backstory of a cultivar or a breeder or or an lp uh in this case i'm really excited about the man behind quest to tell us a little bit about this guy yeah definitely dean uh for sure so yeah quest cannabis was founded by uh ed chu uh he is um an amazing instagram follow uh i've been following him for a bit it is honestly one of my my favorite instagram accounts for it's it's weed porn uh just nothing but big buds and and uh you know facilities with you know tons of plants going and uh it's just awesome anytime i talk to anyone in the industry about you know good instagram follows um i'll bring his name up and they're already like oh i follow him uh so anyone out there that uh you know hasn't checked it out it's uh decibel cc dot ed on instagram uh it's a badass follow for uh kind of keeping up to with with quest and what they're doing um he's also one of their master growers too so you know very hands-on with the plants um and ed was the man who worked closely with uh the genetics legend capulator to bring the mac one genetics to quest and um i'm such a big fan of the mack one uh cultivar uh big fan of cap two um so just hearing that you know ed ed played a big part in that uh you know he's a legit cannabis og um definitely someone i'd like to burn a doobie with uh you know once all this covered stuff's over with um so ed shew is is the man uh behind quest there and uh i i definitely i gotta give some love too to uh and a big shout out to uh to mo uh my boy over at decibel he's the northern alberta account manager there uh we had a nice catch-up phone call today and uh you know he gave me some some real awesome information just about to put the company there so uh thanks so much mo it's good stuff uh good people making good cannabis so let's talk specifically about how uh they get their cannabis into this uh perfectly rolled joint and other forms so what's the process with quest for sure dino they uh how they grow in small batch uh hang dried uh dry trimmed by hand uh ensuring buds aren't overly handled uh protecting the trichomes um their buds are fed uh glacial uh mountain water uh with uh fortunately just a perfect ph just naturally there so uh they're able to uh to feed their plants with this glacial water uh they've got three facilities um the the main one kind of the first one to really get going was the the quest estate and that was formerly from the we grow side of things uh it's a hundred acres um a hundred acre state in the creston valley uh cannabis countries as a lot of people call it and in beautiful british columbia they have that provincial water license that i mentioned that allows them to access the fresh water from the creek that runs through the property it's a 26 000 square foot indoor production facility with 10 grow rooms and two bedrooms and i was a big fan of seeing this uh approximately 1 000 square feet per room no bigger than that uh love that i love seeing that the smaller size rooms keep it small batch is the way to go and they also have a tissue tissue culture lab uh and uh and they also have some you know rock and genetics in their portfolio there they've got the mac one uh the gelato 33 which is the larry bird pineapple cake and uh yeah uh also one of my faves too dino the uh the pre 98 bubba kush i i love that one so much i i want to see it back i haven't seen it in alberta for a while so if anyone from quest is listening please bring it back to alberta but uh yeah that's the uh the quest to stay there dean um actually yeah there's the uh the photo of it right there so uh just a gorgeous facility uh right in the mountains yeah that is absolutely gorgeous what a backdrop uh for sure so that that's the main facility right yeah that's right dino uh the secondary facility which is uh not quite licensed yet but will be very soon like we'll be operational very soon uh it's called thunderchild cultivation and it's near uh battleford uh saskatchewan and this is gonna be their large-scale purpose-built craft cannabis facility so it's 80 000 square feet uh it's gonna have 20 grow rooms and uh kind of be like what the quest to say is but on a larger scale so uh keeping you know the same kind of uh growing i guess habits and tendencies but on a larger scale and it's named after one of the company's uh first and largest investors uh the thunder child first nation it's an independent cree nation based out of uh turtleford saskatchewan so that's thunderchild and then the third facility is called the plant uh and that's their extraction and processing facility uh located right here in calgary where i'm at uh and that's the 16 000 square foot facility with an additional 45 000 square feet uh available for expansion uh and this is where all those delicious general admission carts are made so uh the plant is there here in calgary uh those are the three main facilities do you know wow so it sounds like they certainly uh you know have that progression plan of uh you know starting out with that beautiful facility in creston and uh moving forward so uh we got a little bit of a glimpse of that website the website again is www.quest i'll bring it up here and i find this website first of all just the the the photos are sharp the images are crisp it's a really beautiful looking uh website and then you kind of get into some of the information we showed you the uh the pictures that they have but uh you know as as you can kind of talk about what you like about this website i'll scroll down from the many many many many i feel like the guy from police academy many cultivars uh that they have it's just uh it's quite a stable they might say if we were talking about racehorses no doubt i i like that a lot quite the stable indeed yeah um some serious serious genetics there uh and all all pretty rare too all unique um i'm a big fan too of when you when you actually click into a cultivar there they've got like kind of three three pages per per cultivar and it's very consistent each each cultivar is going to have the same information uh genetics breakdown terpenes um a little kind of write up about it um and then the pictures like i all the pictures on there just make my mouth uh water um it's all just tremendous looking butt covered in trichomes look at that it's just gorgeous and and that's you know that's part of attracting people this is part of your ability to advertise of course it is age gated and things like that so you know a website in a industry where you're not allowed to advertise it's really really important and you know we've done some different lps in the past where you know the website was either under construction or was non-existent and this is a a real powerful way for for these companies to get their product out there and the best looking product that they have out there through their own site yeah dino right uh yeah well said it's it's uh for me this this website's a real full package deal there uh good information too you know but in the about section uh and i'm also a big fan of like the the aesthetics of it that the black uh and that kind of like mint green uh it's very contrasting just works really well easy on the eyes yeah i i would agree uh it is uh it is a good looker that's for sure packed with a lot of information so let's get some information on the history of cush mints uh what are we talking about for the lineage yeah dino so cushman's is uh is bubba kush crossed with animal mints and that gives us the the cush mints and bubba kush is a northern lights cross with triangle kush uh northern lights just classic classic cultivar there it's in all kinds of genetics we always see it come up if you really look at a genetic breakdown of a cultivar and then the animal mints we've got is animal cookies and cinnamon cookies so uh kind of a double down on the cookies there um giving us the animal mints and uh those two cross create uh cushman's and it was initially bred by california cannabis genetics legends uh seed junkie genetics i feel like we've talked about them a little bit let's say in the last couple months they've come up quite a bit and uh and they're for some amazing cultivars like like sunset sherbert uh ellie kush cake cake crashers uh and and many other awesome ones they've got a real awesome list yeah that is delicious sounding and and you know when you mention northern lights it seems to me it's one of those kind of like foundation cultivars that uh you know it would be impossible to you know to pick the top cultivars of all time i think but i think that northern lights is one of those ones that's just uh it's it's in so much so it's kind of the foundation of so many other cultivars out there it yeah it is it's you see it all over the place i i think yeah definitely it's it's up there and i guess one of the the founding fathers you know it's uh it's prevalent in a lot of genetics there i think uh maybe other ones too might be like a haze or a skunk number one we see those kind of come up in a lot too there's there's someone should write a book you know about like the uh the 10 most influential uh cannabis genetics out there because you know i feel like there you could you could list 10 real good ones there that you know have just created and created spread their their genetics all over the world you know what would be a good book is the top 10 most influential cultivars written about some of the most influential people in cannabis so you have you know somebody writing about this cultivar and why it's so influential but it's those people that are you know i think time magazine or somebody does that they'll have you know somebody um you know very famous person right about barack obama or something like that so i think that would be kind of a cool idea that you know the the top 10 most influential cannabis people talking about the most influential cultivars yeah i would i would love to have to see that yeah for sure we're giving away our best ideas for free here so we got to stop doing that all right let's get to the thc percentage on the the bats that i picked up uh from jensen lakes uh in st albert at plant life today this is 27.6 and this that that's getting up there in you know i you know we we've seen some creeping up to 29 and 30 before but you know this is uh this you know when you average it out this is pretty high isn't it yeah definitely 27 that's a hard hitter for sure um we don't see that that those numbers too too much in the in the wreck market um it's definitely a hard hitter for sure uh what's in a name tell us what you think this is named after so i i think it's just a strictly a genetics name uh you know we've got the bubba kush and the animal mints give us cush mints i think it's also taste related too with the flavor there's there's some subtle kind of mintiness uh to the taste of the cushman's as well dino indeed as well all right let's get into the look of this and you're you're looking at uh the pre-rolls uh on there right now uh i i'll start with the uh the tub here um and uh when when i look at this tub the first thing or what i love about it is it's just really easy to open you just push on the side pops open and then boom your two pre-rolls are in there nice that there's not two tubs for two pre-rolls so i like the uh the packaging uh it's easy to get into as far as that and it's you know still you're not gonna you're not gonna force it up if if it's uh somebody that doesn't know what they're doing so there is child proofing with it uh tell us about the actual pre-rolls and uh how they come to be yeah most definitely dino so initially uh off the start uh quest was doing um pre-rolls they were one gram pre-rolls and it was a two-pack uh and i feel like uh there was a little bit of a feedback from the the you know the customers out there people were looking for their half grams options and so they made the switch uh now we're gonna start seeing uh two packs all both half gram in there uh and every pre-roll from quest is hand rolled and hand-weighed uh and they use vegan papers and those papers come from a 200 over 200 year old french mill so uh it's pretty neat uh and then as you can see in the photo there it's you know got a quest branded uh a filter too um they're i get the quest pre-rolls all the time i'm uh i'm a big fan they're one of my go-to's for sure dino well and that just uh kind of you know adds a nice human touch of uh loading these up and twisting them off and uh the you know the the one that i pulled out was in fantastic shape so nice to know that uh that there's that human touch with it let's talk some terpenes so what do you have for us as far as terps pressure dino uh pinene is the dominant terpene so that's uh kind of the the pine aroma as one would one would guess uh limonene is in there too and that's kind of the citrus fruity uh terpene uh we've got caryophylline in there dino your fave and that's uh black pepper kind of a spicy spiciness to your cannabis and then linalool's in there as well and that's kind of the floral lavender uh very heavy terpene there um pretty good mix though uh four or four of my my jams actually pining is uh quickly becoming my favorite one dean and uh yeah it's good to see it right there at the top yeah and linalool is quickly becoming a kind of a second favorite of mine so i think we're both really going to like this i as far as the smell i i asked nosy mcgee uh to smell it she's on strike though she said she's not smelling until i start doing more dishes uh so nosey mcgee for anybody watching is my wife who who chris and i always try to give the blind taste test to and get her honest opinion and she doesn't smoke use marijuana this is the odd edible here and there and more cbd so we get a real uh and we don't tell her anything about it so i i couldn't get that blind to the smell test this week but i got some some kind of uh minty pepper uh if if that kind of peppery mint uh taste i don't know what do you get when you smell it yeah dino i got that too i got pepper and pine uh with a subtle mint to it as well um i also felt like it was it's gonna sound weird it just smells it smells proper it smells like it was grown properly um yeah very enjoyable whenever i've had like the 3.5 of the cushminks uh quite a few times and uh yeah it smells delightful looks amazing too i should have mentioned that when we were talking about the looks there well but that's the thing that you know the the look the smell of the plant it for me it just smells healthy and and you know you know as you mentioned fresh just the way cannabis uh should be so so i really like that so um you know normally we have these pre-rolls and as you know as you've been out here normally uh it would basically uh look like a cheech and chong movie at this point because there would be so much smoke going if we were doing pre-rolls but i'm not the healthiest right now i'm still getting over pneumonia i'm not even doing this a lot but i'm gonna what i've done chris is i've just um you know basically uh taken apart the the wonderful pre-roll that they've done put it in my volcano because that's how i'm gonna use this today because i don't think it's a smart thing to be smoking so just for everybody out there that's what i'm going with uh today is uh instead of the pre-roll uh lighting it up i'm gonna use the vape in in a small amount but what is the taste that you get with cushman's uh for sure do you know so for me it's first off delicious uh gotta say it's delicious uh it's kind of a minty uh minty kush uh so it's got that kind of creamy gasket that's there definitely some spicy overtones um definitely a big fan of it for sure man it's uh it's nice now when you talk about um kind of that creamy cush taste can you explain maybe for people that aren't as uh familiar with it what you mean by that yeah i think it's just just a flavor that's you know associated with with cushions uh it's that that creaminess kind of almost confectionary um [Music] the states there they refer to you know really good cannabis as you know you got you got that gas like it's uh and it's they're asking for kush yeah i like that it's kind of like how people in in all parts of the world can refer to just really good cannabis as bc bud it might not be from bc but uh you know it's that terminology so gas taste whatever so okay i'm going to give a quick taste on this yeah and go go easy on our two there bud right like i got an answer but totally right the pneumonia thing is serious and like i i think you uh subbing out the the joint there for a bag is you know uh smart option right and take take it easy uh we'll be smoking those newbies soon enough indeed you know it's funny i g i get more of a minty taste than i did a minty smell uh and maybe it was uh because it's already in in pre-roll format and we always talk about after the grind we didn't grind it up this time but i definitely get more of a minty uh and i know what you mean about the creamy taste um and it's funny i had more spicy peppery in the in the taste and the smell than i do in the taste so it's almost kind of reversed in the taste for me a little bit but uh i don't know i it's definitely tasty though and and i'm not usually a mint guy so i know i like it that it's not as overpowering as i thought it might be yeah do you know i mean it's it's not like uh drinking a bottle of mouthwash minty like it's it's it's you know that's that's there and that's that's why i think i like it so much uh i think too you probably were experiencing some uh you know the fact that you put it in a vaporizer um you know you probably got to enjoy some of those terps um in in a good way indeed uh i like that so what's uh you know your experience as we like to point out everybody does experience cannabis a little bit different because of our endocannabinoid system what is your experience when you hit cushman's for sure so uh for me and i i've hit cushman's quite a bit it's been uh one of my one of my go-tos it's in my stable uh quite a bit um for me the high the high creeps up uh you know it's it's it's a real slow creep but then when it hits you it hits you really hard i find myself to be stoned you know uh feeling great that initial head buzz you know off the start uh you know filled with fun euphoric cerebral blast blast to the head really makes me smile and laugh a lot i think this is one of those cultivars that uh i think makes me funnier or i think i'm funnier with it it's definitely uh uplifting in the head and uh and super super relaxing on the body so once that initial kind of head buzz uh kind of settles down a bit uh it it works its way into a nice melty body stone uh that is super enjoyable um i think though for me it's um don't don't plan uh you know a big day of productivity if you're gonna be smoking this stuff uh you'll find yourself just get your chill on on the couch it's pretty uh it's pretty relaxing one for me all right so that brings us to the three w's of who what and when is this good for and of course these are just general recommendations but what do you think when you think of the three w's for this so i think who's good for dean is uh level three uh this is uh expert smokers are now the thc levels are pretty high there uh you know i think um someone who you know smokes quite a bit uh yeah beginners stay away from it please no doubt and and that's important uh especially when you talk about it being a bit of a creeper as well um you know somebody that new to cannabis might not think it's coming on as fast as it should and then might go and have some more and with the high thc level so that's why we kind of recommend on a level one two and three so this is definitely expert i like that recommendation by you for sure man um when it's good for dean uh evening time definitely evening time right after dinner is is one of my go-to's uh i've also enjoyed it right before bed too it's it's super nice um starting your day off with some cushman's can uh can derail any to-do's you might have as i mentioned there previously it uh it definitely kind of puts you in chill zone um and what it's good for dean getting your chill on uh like like i said right um fully just relaxing um i know like on quest the quest website that you know they listed as like a pretty balanced hybrid but uh for me my experience with it it's pretty indica dominant uh uh pretty relaxing um so it's good for yeah funny movies uh documentaries two are really nice on it um i enjoyed watching euler's game on it too that was that was nice as well so sports was really nice with the cushions too all right so there that is the three w's of who what when uh mints from quest an excellent excellent producer very very high end stuff so exciting uh i can't wait to be able to smoke joints again and be able to burn them because i i think you know whatever product you get from them is always top-notch and i know you guys are going to have a lot of this available at your new plant life location that you know you is is will be open uh as as people listen to this podcast yeah that's right dino uh yeah the platinum life uh mahogany here in calgary uh southeast side of calgary is opening up today january 27th uh gonna be opening up in the afternoon though we're not doing a 10 a.m open here um but i was just there um earlier today working on some last minute preparations store looks amazing uh the staff are really awesome too a lot of people are passionate about cannabis their store manager hannah is great as well um so people uh listening if you're in

conversation with tai earlier in this show and i know he's really excited about the things that are coming and and so are you so lots of stores already lots more on the way and you can pick up some cushman's uh from quest as you uh head into those stores chris thanks as always for joining me man we'll chat next week", "ZkHLgl973oA": "[Music] YouTube's cracking down so I wanted to put this disclaimer in the video and let everybody know that you have to be 18 or older to watch my videos and that everything in my videos are legal industrial hemp flour how is it going everybody sure homie smoke CBD and today I'm doing something a little different I've made a video talking about it in the past one of my pre-roll hemp talks so I figured I'd make an updated and more accurate opinionated video while doing a pre-roll hem talk on the same topic and it is will you fail a drug test for smoking CBD flour so I went out and I got an at-home marijuana drug test and yeah it tests for I'm hoping it tests for THC because I know that some drug tests they they're only looking for cannabinoids which in that case CBD the cannabinoid so you technically would fail but I'm pretty sure this one is for THC and also guys I know it probably won't tamper with the results at all but I figured I would do a pre-roll him talk and smoke a little bit before taking the marijuana test so today I'm gonna be smoking on this little space candy Preet well guys there's one gram 18 to 22 percent CBD and if you guys have watched any of my other pre-roll hemp talks with a little pre-roll you know how it goes there terpenes are the best and they all include this little pink slip of paper with all the information you need on it percentage you know the laws of the histogram QR code all that good stuff 17 to 22 percent CBD so pretty high in CBD so yeah I'm gonna try this pre-roll out to smoke a little bit and then take the the drug test guys you guys know my channel you guys obviously know I smoke CBD flower every day about three to four times a day so I would call myself a heavy user of hemp flour so we're gonna see if a every day all day smoker can pass a marijuana test by just smoking CBD flour let's try some of this space candy by little if you guys can see I am I'm repping lit nostril with this dope t-shirt those are on their website as well and it's awesome guys I love their logo their branding and their hemp flour they have the best terpenes they're my in my top three companies and they got the best terpenes I love it pineapple Express and flower review coming very soon guys with a giveaway involved so be on the lookout for that if you have somethin Flavio go ahead and light up get the good vibes going with me get Medicaid guys Cheers it's got a great terpene profile it just tastes like some some dank guys I love the aftertaste of it look natural always brings great terpenes you can tell that it is high in CBD I'm getting some effects already on those first couple polls and yeah guys there's nothing nothing bad to say about lid natural guys they use real flour and no shaker trim and their pre rolls they have my favorite pre rolls and some of my favorite flour in general so yeah I'm just gonna take a couple of drags on this and then we'll get to the test I just wanted to smoke the space candy on a video I felt like y'all deserve to see me try really good guys yeah nothing bad to say at all I'm getting great effects feels feels like your normal shower space candy right now great for stress and you know some relief from anxiety along with that and yeah it's the perfect pretty role guys let Naturals got the best pre-rolls from right now they're having a 50% off sale go check them out y'all seriously perfect pretty well guys all right so I'm gonna go ahead and top that out I'm gonna save that one for later probably kick back watch a movie with it tonight or something since we're in quarantine and [ __ ] you know go check that row well guys I'll put a link down below pin it to the top for y'all and yeah at least try one of their pre rolls and I guarantee you you try pre roll it's gonna make you want to buy the flower of that strain because that's what happened to me I tried the pre roll and I was like man I gotta get some of that and I haven't looked back since I I order and smoke on lit natural all the time like I said one of my top three companies of all time and they are highly slep on and once people catch word of them they're they're gonna blow up and I'ma be sittin here like I told y'all like they want their [ __ ] good but anyways guys let's get to drug test see what I see what my results are all that so it says if we test read the instructions carefully and must be done in a room with temperature 65 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit and it says collect urine and a clean cup remove the test strip from the sealed pouch which is this and immerse the strip into the urine with the arrow pointing towards the urine take the strip out after a minimum of 10 to 15 seconds and lay the strip on a clean dry non absorbent surface such as a box or pouch on the sticking on my tape because I'll be easy to clean up and says read results in five minutes do not read results after more than five minutes so yeah so I guess they only hold it in the cup for 10-15 seconds pulled out wait five minutes read your results so we're gonna be looking for one line is positive two lines is negative and one line at the bottom is invalid okay so one line at the top of the stick is positive two lines negative one line at the bottom and valid so we're looking for a negative guys let's show you the little chart there hopefully you guys can see the results they all show you've a box just in case it's on the box as well I'll see that that's what we're looking for we're looking for a negative guys I don't want to test positive because I I tell people that they'll most likely get by with a drug test smoking here and there I never tell them that they should smoke every day so and I smoke every day so don't let this be you know if I fail it that doesn't mean that you're gonna fail just gives you smoke CBD flower once a week or something cuz like I said I smoke every day three four times a day from the time I wake up to the time I go to bed so I'm trying to open the box up so we can it says open it for further information the guidelines for detection is 50 nano grams of milliliter all right guys I really got a pee so I'm just gonna turn around and I'll Center it and I'll go ahead and pee in this little cup I've made and we'll get to the results of this drug test going guys I'm gonna stick that little go-go try up guys with a [ __ ] bomb I'm not sponsored by that's just my personal opinion one of my favorite companies guys pee in this cup and get this pouch open we'll see what my results are well as you can see I need to flush my kidneys I thought I thought this Rockstar would make my urine a little bit more clear but I guess it's not working I'll know if I shout I might sensor that I don't know if YouTube would get mad for showing a cup of my pee but uh anyway let's get this little strip out and we'll see what an everyday all-day CBD smoker test positive or negative so go ahead and pull this strip out that's what the strip looks like guys it says THC on it and I'm gonna be pointing it down into the cup like that and we're gonna be looking for two lines you know three it was dipped and now we gotta let it sit for five minutes so um yeah we're gonna be looking for two lines guys we want two lines on that stick so I guess I will check back with y'all in five minutes so i'ma start a timer we'll be back in five minutes guys [Music] I figured I'd like this space candy back up for a couple more talks while I wait on that the results there I'm just saying that guys it's not looking too good it looks like one lines popped up all right now but you know I still got three three minutes four minutes so like I said though guys I I smoked all day and every day you know three to four times a day is my minimum so you know I feel like if someone that only smoked once a week took this test you know they pass the flying colors but I just wanted to do this little experiment for anybody out there that does smoke three to four times a day or more every day just to kind of see what you know what might be popping up on a drug screen the space candy though guys I mean I might I might be ordering some flour of this to review for y'all because I want to see and see what it looks like and feel it and roll it because this has got me feeling good I had to light it back up super fire we only got one line right now I'm hoping within this next two minutes that a second line pops up but it's not looking good y'all well I'm gonna give it the benefit of the doubt and wait a little longer but uh looks like I might be failing boys now like I said this was a dollars a dollar store drug test so you know like I said that could be testing just for cannabinoids in that case you know since it was a super cheap drug test I think it was a dollar they could just be testing for cannabinoids and it might not be testing for strictly THC and like I said I smoke a lot of hemp flowers so that those minuscule amounts of THC could add up to enough to fail a drug test I mean this is not this is not a demonstration for everybody to base off of I just wanted I was curious so from for myself so I wanted to film the results and yeah I don't want anybody to think this is exactly how it would go for them been about five minutes I think she's known boys and yeah it looks it looks like I failed a second line did not pop up at all guys as you can see just one line I'm honestly kinda upset guys I was super confident that I would pass this little test but down I guess I feel it says th the on on the test but uh could you know with it being such a cheap test it could just be looking for cannabinoids tea and CBDs one of them along with THC so yeah I hope you all enjoyed this little demonstration maybe if you smoked CBD hemp flour all day every day like me maybe you wouldn't pass a drug test for you know marijuana but like I said if you if you just casually smokin once a day once every other day or hearing there you know it varies person to person your size your weight your height all that stuff what you put in your body I just wanted to show a demonstration luckily I'm in a place where they don't drug test me anyway I'm not on probation nothing like that so I'm good either way and it's still legal and I'm sure they're gonna upgrade the tests to be better about that so yeah this was a everyday CBD hemp flour smoker taking a whole marijuana test I hope this may be helped any of you kind of you know answered some of your questions and like I said once a week I don't think would do anything maybe I'll take a little break a tolerance break and just test my results for smoking once a week or something I don't know I just wanted to film this check out a little link down in the comments pinned to the top leave a comment down below if you've taken test yourself and failed or passed and

I love how it's purple right oh my gosh in ignore a broken nose I literally broke 3 this weekend like right when I'm coming to LA like why couldn't I break my nose after this little trip a little shy to be smoking on public position and recording I could just twist it much easier they're making fun of me over there so I really feel it's fondo this the strain is grunts that's what it is you don't have to come help me so I hella [ __ ] up whenever and it really was totally wrong look how I burned it because it's really windy so I can't really they hit a pretty bomb they're strong a little harsh because they are strong and I hate the way the fact that I [ __ ] up so bad but I really like the clock the glass tip that they have that's really cool it just looks like I'm letting the smoke it's looking sweet working and what I really know how to describe the taste I just feel like a tick I've tried so many products that I egg pan sometimes come to the conclusion I don't know what to think I'm smoking I just know that I get some smashed you know what I mean to be honest I feel like this was less um I'm I'm almost done with that yet and I've noticed that it's not pulled all the way down with what's it called waxing Keith on top let the this is on the tip the glass tip but there's like this little portion there doesn't have waxing Keith and I feel like the regular the regular what are the the regular addition they are filled all the way to the tip you know I don't know if I didn't pay attention but they're honest anything the same and they don't you can't find why what's so special about it still on but it tastes exactly the same like the regular edition I don't know what's the limited you know what I mean I'm not really sure where runs come from I believe that it's from cookies but I'm not too sure if you do know comment down below I'm almost done with it and the hill okay but now I feel like I would not purchase this again it would be more than worth that you've just

like a psychopath in there some [ __ ] no while I was watching it I was watching no I didn't watch it I was watching a joaquin phoenix joker interview on jimmy kimmel and then he said something about his lap he was like that laughs you do in the movie this is kind of like Robert De Niro and Cape Fear or some [ __ ] did you see that interview where he showed the whole audience the outtakes of walking Phoenix that [ __ ] you liked on Instagram Jimmy Kimmel showed that [ __ ] and then you could see walking Phoenix he was kind of upset that he actually showed that [ __ ] no you like the outtake it was on his before he was like cher Cher oh you said harder it was just me and him yeah I would have been hiding a pension now actually I'm pretty literate okay yeah guys just hopefully the lighting is good I mean [ __ ] it should be good but the glass tip is all right okay you said it like a cigar supposed to be like a luxury a guard yeah like backwards again yeah and it makes it cool because those it'll it'll stop burning once it hits the glass tip so you're not burning off like you're not smoking the filter if it was like paper or something this says it's brought Nana's a constraint that's an interesting name this is like well you know like you can tell yeah it's pot shelf but all-natural wrap glass culture the word natural dough isn't that lady shout out to show grow natural natural late no is that really natural they're saying the rap is natural oh yeah a naturally occurring in the wild what are you what are you what are you getting right now I'm just really it's like saying I don't know very much forget okay this is dodo hold on it was like four of us my those three just gave up I was at home that's you know it's him okay but that doesn't make sense because tobacco is natural - it's a [ __ ] plan so when they say all-natural on that - it's awful marketing when you see natural you're inclined to buy it more I guess you're reading CNN IGN your culture don't i GN don't tell me any bad news about last of us so you can tell me the [ __ ] outrage right when i found out last of us wasn't gonna have multiplayer but then the next day they said they were gonna have it just not with the original [ __ ] disk i don't know what the [ __ ] they're trying to do here some sort of like marketing scheme or some [ __ ] but I loved multiplayer on Last of Us she was dope he would petition for it no it's already on there it's already a player they're not gonna have it on the it might be a deal seat you guys are talking about the other day remember me they've always would have had they've always mean and there's no way they wouldn't have had it it's like it was just like how many people would yeah well and not another thing some people like we're like good hope no multiplayer just like those people suck at the multiplayer it's like dude they could they could have a good single player and I'm good multiplayer they did it on the first one why can't they do in the second one they're like oh let's just put all our marbles into single-player single players dude have you ever played a [ __ ] story again after you play it beat it be honest see exactly there you go yeah like a harder mode or whatever right now that's online thing there's a progression still it's still campaign no it's you play the progression on boardwalk sort of campaign they can play with your friends so it's the same no it's not it's not some the way so I mean then what I'm just trying to say into a campaign like no clear period like you had in the first part exactly what - and I'm saying that's it like this there's just no argument about it like I'm not really people like you know people play different one player yeah from what I heard like I seen you guys play it all the time and it was hyped up too so but I see what you're saying about border lines you do get to replay it but when you replay it you're you you're basically coming back with the stuff you had already it's basically still a progression you're gonna get levels above the level that you ended with you know I'm saying last of us you beat the game it's you just beat it because you you like the story that's it you know there's nothing to do after there's no endgame remember I remember watching my sister playing the first one it was kind of short yeah hello art so I gave up on do Annie oh oh the samurai game was I should do the bosses were winners never quit eventually you used to get tired of quitting only succeed after that so how you liking this it's good would you say it's anything to stick out differently than the other ones with this dream was just same experience I've only dated like two of them oh the one a whole flowers no one here right now and the one a Halle flowers seemed harsher I don't know is I was just two of us really that's two of us this time so feels like it's easier oh it's cool we're good actually oh it does do it that's it for this video though I do get closer gonna say I don't know you just boy the camera I just asked you guys have what you thought of it oh all right just stop [Music] [Music]", "mMsenYLocSQ": "welcome so a pre-roll from one life

so yesterday we went to a very magical place ah beautiful I wish I could live with an enemy really nice office office long journeys Lowell offices oh yeah it was so so so there's a magical place this is a week company in California where we just currently recreationally legal and it was medicinal a legal until very late so anyone could come here and buy and smoke marijuana but we haven't opened any of these bags yet we thought we'd save them to open with you guys they put so much thought into everything that they like make and manufacture everything is natural they don't use any parabens you know anything like that anything nasty all of their pre roll blunts in fact they're kept in glass little cases and they don't cut the plastic it's so good and great the planets here so we're stoked about that smells great my favorite thing about lower yes is that they make pre-rolls like really surgery yeah cuz I know a lot of people have problems with rolling yes these are the first three things I'm gonna grab out of here these are my two favorite one is a sativa we don't know what it's a TV weed is I'm sure we can give you some more info in another time and then there's our hybrids which is a mix of the two types of weed sativa and indica well this is so easy to over there yeah okay and then it's got a little much and nebulae can we see all the love oh yeah the branding is not responding to save God I kind of want to strike for these wretches I think you should see if they're any goods yeah cuz they've got it at the end right being with pyromaniac yeah you got a little much striking thing to the end okay okay okay all right mean I could work guys [Music] that's a nice match I love they have on the inside but this looks up here they've got their story which is wonderful they have the story on the back - yeah I love that it's got a bit of history - I would see America not the oldest country in the world everyone goes very techy whereas Lowell's gone very nice and natural what I love the most about Lowell is that pretty much all of it is designed so so beautifully they were kind of well I don't really know cuz I wasn't around but they're the first like free role in a pack like cigarette yeah joints that I've seen especially with the matches on the end so yeah these three roles are [ __ ] genius and that's only the first thing to get out the back all right let's move onto the other side lucky dip here we go we've got a cute little t-shirt that's cool cute like everything again is natural again I love it I'm restoring no plastic wrapping here [ __ ] hello this soft I like this oh it's so soft oh it's a little crop Oh corrupt oh that is cute as hell right now yeah might want to bad little thing on she's gonna put it on I'm glad it put it how the obvious entering a thing with furniture I know how bizarre Redux putting clothes on for the first time ever on camera oh is that world first this is really cute cute shirt logo it's really nice and soft it smells like wheeze honey was right wrong I love there is good I love this is cute now take it off okay oh this is heavy Oh what is this oh my god you could kill someone with this buy it no oh nice color huh I really don't throw every dog ready a little about that heavy oh I love that back it's all soft and smooth anyway although what that's an ashtray right this this is a paperweight ooh that's the blue-chip it's got a little ridges on their feet to place your please just leave for your blunt or whatever though I'm smoking from that's one of your nice career old cones and it's keep in keeping with the logo it's got the look on the inside I love the way it's etched in kind of like you know a Victorian diagram it really goes back to that kind of 1908 year you know what I mean it's very very heavy very nice very keeping with a brown they have a very strong brownie yes I really we're gonna struggle to get this home yes oh no suitcase way last but not less not least I'm gonna guess it is this is top shelf full hour oh my god I've seen one of these before and I'm really excited to show you guys this this box opens up and so so that you make grind up your wheat from the glass jar that it comes in and keep it in this beautiful little tray that that is just so you'll never lose your [ __ ] weed it will never blow across the table it will never blow out of a window of you a solo is such a massive company so make sure that they credit all of their phones because really like give it a smell be oh dear Lord and it like that is beautiful that's not like it's making me giggle it does smell like it's gonna give you the Google and end in the car as we may or may not know is over nice relaxing body hi so certainly will be smooth this for bed when we not yeah boss across the name of the MLA coach that we've been smile yeah la Kirsch knocking me right out it's a great early on calories yes I'm not dreaming at all which is great for me yeah you just been so great if you ever have any problem to speak or anything I really suffer from it [ __ ] godsend absolutely low thank you so much all your [ __ ] thank you doctor it was so nice it's certainly what they're certain as we Bob this is only got them know I was just gonna say super kind of people and they gave me something that is really really beautiful I think it's so girly with me designs yeah it's a piece of wonder and I can only just imagine playing with it while I'm high it is this beautiful wooden box but you maybe see on the corners it doesn't just stay as a box it opens up into a nice flat rolling surface it's me and sleek hadn't seen it so I can up a second ice tray on your coffee table it's [ __ ] gorgeous comes with two wheels decides who's so good trusty sativas and this one is supreme white the name of that one not sure but I do it now the white is like a long history and we don't think so and it's yes it looked the but is zero women are I do like that that's so strong out here everything in the air smells like [ __ ] this one I love this a slightly spicy it's a little Clementine yes my guess is from lady sativa farm 707 above that so again Predaking all our dessert always that smells so fruity mmm that's Dean yeah it's not like a candy shop it smells like you know you're in an old fashioned sweet shop and you open up a jar you smells like a sherbet or something yeah that's why it smells like okay I'm probably smelling right it's like it's a set this Clementine citrus it's amazing please alright okay and what else we got here we got grinder this is a nice metal grinder as well you know your shitty plastic ones that you get then they don't call it a grinder and there's also something on the bottom which may or may not know it's called a Keef catcher Keith spelt ke e F and this is the actual this is what that contains the THC and CBD and cannabinoids in the week so when you grind your keith falls through here and occasionally you can put it like back into whatever you're rolling and you'll get super strong wrong doesn't wicked so it's like a super super super finance if kind of thing and they're all captures in the bottom here it's got a little scrape fun scooper for your keys which it isn't my kids a little keep keeper little keep keep forgive keeper I love that this isn't actually the grant I believe comes with this kit a little bit small in there but we did request this yeah we did my questions you will get a little grinder if you get this kit yes aliens oceans and then you get obviously some brooches for when you're rolling obviously very important you don't want to be putting a filter in there and wasting all your weed very much story then you got these papers which again all-natural no bleach nothing nasty and they're nothing or and of course again you've got the story on those lateral rounding super cute pants right there so you ain't never gonna lose them I always lose my papers do yes I [ __ ] always like guys any papers now I'm gonna swivel this in a piece of a4 paper right and accidentally always somehow find him in the wash so viola Manville MRI and they all six to go mine let's get down yeah they get down for some unique everyone wrong my dream of papers donor problems I love the whole mechanism says I know the man who designed it yeah months and months and months figuring I have a bit looks beautiful it'll done it together and if you all this is one less little important thing I want to point out oh yeah roll you can probably find YouTube videos on how to use one of these which is it will roll it for you basically you put your weed in you put your Roach in you put your paper in and it will roll it for you so yeah no more dodgy [ __ ] rolls exactly this modeling kit originally a rolling kit kit like everything you need in here exactly and it's gorgeous but you know what being I get something in here because I wanted to show these off because they've got these are the office yesterday oh and I find these are [ __ ] genius so obviously if you're on your own and smoke weed and you roll like a whole joint or whatever I'm really very very very rarely start the whole thing right okay nobody cares about to to just thank you yeah I will always end up talking out a little bit just before the end or halfway through our head I'll roll this one yeah it's not coffee in the morning exactly but close the way this beautiful box yeah we have something that I think they recently brought out I think it's kneeling right thank you thank you these are cools low smokes quick and when I open this pack it up my mind was [ __ ] blown obviously it looks exactly like the other package that we had earlier mm-hmm so it's like a little cigarette packet it's super easy to take around it also has the matches inside so you know even if you're stuck without a lighter will never be actually [ __ ] stuck like you just never move myself club unless you run our matches like me they have a best rating just about on yes when I opened up this packet they [ __ ] blew my mind cuz usually they are lying this way the joints are lying this way inside the packet I opened up this one and I saw to my bewilderment tiny they are dried this brand is doing so much that I've never seen company ever do and there are a lot of companies now doing similar things to Lowell but these guys were the originals original when they say original they really honestly truly mean it yes [ __ ] good this is there's no one doing what these guys there really is I like these smoking packs who else is doing this it was doing like two cigarettes varying especially these didn't quick quick hashtag clicks ups every one of these on your break or whatever have a quick thought I have a sweet think maybe I'm trying to brainstorm something and you're crazy it's like we all have you're just like me yeah that's think of a great idea and by the end of it you [ __ ] genius you know what be what Cheers I think we should spit one of these right now yes I think we should so we didn't smoke one of these yesterday and we don't you did you can't pretty darn high yeah I had a stove oh not really counting it is way way stronger than English food don't make that mistake I don't know where I'm struggling so much I don't know we'll let you for you yeah well I will I'll try and do it all for one match if not I'll use you like a light you baby I got you girl [Music] Thanks okay no girl I'll tell you what I am I say five oh that was a good one out tonight I'd love that we have the full rolls and the quick I look like I don't know so many different ways because already hi ruff flower lady isn't on you can wear this cute shirt too so yeah what it's another loves I think you think that I can spin their ass thank you so much guys for people take care what oh yeah [Music]", "EFbtQwkRz5w": "hello senior stoner fans is the real senior stoner back at you for another in our series of product discussions and demonstrations I bet you all thought I was about Jimmy joints only well I'm not I have a real affinity for pre-rolls special pre-rolls and I want to discuss those with you now I brought up basically one of each of the ones I keep in one's one of the one of each of the ones that I like and I'm gonna talk about each one the brand and whether or not I'm impressed with it etc let's start with the basics first we're gonna go to the east cold east coast cone this is an East Coast cone and all these are gonna be basically on Raw tight papers and an East Coast cone boasts that it uses premium flour covered in hash and Keith this is ak-47 it's a one point five gram play roll I like this but it is not one of my most powerful pre-rolls or my favorites again the East Coast cone the next product is the hex the triple hex pre-roll premium quality flour again this one is dipped in live resin and covered in Keef hmmm a nice smell to it they come in sativa hybrid and indica now we're gonna get to the more complicated products these products are northeast this products Middle Atlantic mid-atlantic called the spaceback it's a famous pre-roll this is one of the strongest pre-rolls that mrs. stoner and I have ever smoked this thing is literally encased with Keef you can see it there and it drips literally drips it doesn't droop it drips the amount of smoke that comes off this thing is like a like a somebody threw a gas grenade at you this is the space bat again comes in hybrid indica or sativa and premium distill it flower and Keef that's the difference distill it okay I'm not gonna say I stole my idea distill it for Jimmy joints from this one they stole it for me now we're gonna go to something that's a little bit unusual this is called a canna woods - gram + quarter gram of shatter and a quarter gram of hash it's a cat woods special blunt kind of woods let's check it out it is different now we don't at this house like Polly's per se but these things are so darn tasty and they put a glass mouthpiece in if you can believe it coated in Keith's fine hash just incredible quality weed in this one these are strong definitely a party pre-roll this isn't something you want to try yourself well now we're gonna talk about my favorite brand people don't agree with me but this is my favorite brand because it offers different flavors I'm a flavour you guys know me I'm a flavour hound with my dabs I like them mmm I like to swish my dabs well I'm the same way with my flour so Jimmy joins you all know I put the kitchen sink in them for a variety of reasons let's talk Kalani's starting with the silver Golani roll this is a 30% to Teva 70% indica blend and gowanni is one of the most unique things I've come across in pre-rolls because they dust the joints I only want to hold it they dust it that's dust on top and then inside is the taste that's just incredible we're gonna show you something else now that's even better that's the silver roll well they also make the Golani gold roll the gowanni gold the Golani gold has the same percentage it's 30 and 70 but this one steps up the power and steps up the bouquet you can really wave this across your face and just smell it and go wow it's like crumbling a bud of the best weed this is the Golani gold roll well then we go into really why aleko Lonnie so much Golani flavors their products that's right this is a great role actually grape the Golani great brawl and we have tried and many times its exact on spot on for like Welch's we just swish it around our mouths sometimes and we talk to ourselves what we're doing it and go my god that's like grape juice okay so it's the Welch's grape juice of grape jelly joint then we have the moxx green apple roll I'm kidding you not this is not moths but think about it kids this is the Mott green apple roll it's applesauce in a joint okay applesauce in a joint but you gotta be kidding right you're not and it gets better how about sherry how about oh go Lonnie sherry okay to go Lonnie cherry is like sucking on a hard candy it's incredible how accurate they have gotten these things I mean it's just such a treat when I come across Kalani's and then one of my favorites this is something that's really cool blueberry how many people really think that there's a blueberry joint out there okay well there is blueberry it smells once again just like you're opening up a box a carton of blueberries it's incredible so you combine all these and you say wow those are great do you guys like to see fruit gum get like bubble gum I'm not kidding this one is a strawberry banana roll I know right you like the stripes on it strawberry banana roll and the pitch with this one it's like chewing gum I swear it's like chewing gum so all of these together mean that basically out there on the market and there's Playmore out there you can find just about any flavor any texture any strain you want and do not settle do not settle for the pre-roll that you don't want because they're out there okay you just got a look talk to your dispensaries talk to your people you know and good luck out there hope you enjoyed this discussion on commercially available pre-rolls there's been the real seniors donor have a great day", "ztCNG3-QS9U": "[ __ ] all my shits falling but what's up beautiful [ __ ] hopefully that's not too loud my chair is already going crazy but a we on this consistent video [ __ ] so I'm trying to make this as entertaining as I possibly can while I'm stuck here in this room but even though I'm stuck in here in this room we're still gonna keep it well it is fun [Applause] anyways so we had a good one for you you already read the title the video so you already know what we doing right as a sign up so you know about my life cuz you know this is about me you know this is about me as well my life is my vlog I'm teaching y'all stuff to be helpful and try to make more videos but this about me so in my life you've been seeing it today I uploaded that video for 20 yeah I woke up for work right I exercise in my room not cleaning out for the day and then start recording this video and now after this my grandparents are making some [ __ ] food some steak some green beans and baked potatoes I'm me a baked potato myself once we get into this [ __ ] video so roll the intro let's get into it are y'all ready to be baked [ __ ] potatoes to Fung at home so so let's go new me for that right leg others want small bets really strong [Applause] stay tuned your [ __ ] macaroni alright now that that don't pass intro is over my intro memorize the leadership you should their quality content but what you'll need for this video Finan these papers that we can't roll ourselves with just the papers for some reason I'm slacking but hey you're watching this too so I'm just pre smokes or if you already have filters filter hey then you'll need a lighter at you maybe a Reiner I'm gonna use a grinder a packing stick out front package a stain stick alone for a long time but anyways we need a tray of course the most essential item of this whole process me I mean the drums so once you have your happiness as a crime in some countries you'll need to put that in a binder pack that [ __ ] up all up in there you know how we'd works I'm listening or if not why are you watching this video click off are you trying to click off are you over the age of 18 and a STONER that likes to a joins day I'm here for you yeah now right a different angle as you can see you can see the trade better but the other spot was unreliable I call it in the father stand but anyways oh [ __ ] now it's in the way [ __ ] so I want your weeds right enough like mine is you'll need a home to put it because you don't want your weed being homeless then the unemployment rate will go up even higher than it is because the coronavirus and then we'll have a serious problem it's imagine all the homeless weed out there it's [ __ ] heartbreaking so you're gonna take your front end filter then you grab one your papers wherever the [ __ ] NASA is ready alright one more thing I forgot you'll also need tape of some kind I'm gonna use this kind of packing tape or painters tape I don't even know think we use it for packing whatever you need tape it doesn't matter you'll see why take your paper take one [ __ ] I ripped it love it this should be fine lick the sticky part which in the rolled-up part until that sides flat you feel then you take your little filter you put it in like that little ways in and then so once you have a wraparound kind of nicely you lick the in getting nice and tight around this spot this is kind of a how much selling you just lift it up a bit so that gets tighter no and then should be completely open she'll be able to see all the way through make sure that the top just fold it on when you were covering it so it should steak should create a steady little circle around it but to ensure that when you're packing it the paper doesn't get just it doesn't just get pushed back that's where the taste can come in once you get a little piece of tape when I put it at the bottom where the filter and the paper meet connecting the two between sure and hopefully and won't go nowhere and you got a little bandaid on your joint kinda so and stuff now at this point you're pretty much treating like a regular phone a little less careless maybe it's a little bit more flimsy so be careful because they'll fold quite easily I just licked it in shape so now we can take the weed that we just grind it up take the pretty roll or comb now start packing some in just one scoop fill it up let it fall oh hey I'd say per scoop just pack it down lightly not too much not you little packing in there's some in let it fall and come in with the packing stick maybe hit the sides make sure it's all falling down as far as you can and then I'm going with the pants take gently but enough pressure that just feels right where you're not it doesn't feel like you're pushing it down any further but you're flying in it you know then go around the on the sides make sure it's all even hopefully in order for it to knock there but sometimes it does anyways but most the time I get pretty good for the sometimes sometimes it's a number of things that affect that whether that be [ __ ] it's too windy or the papers rolled a little weird which happens more often and when you roll at yourself in terms of just trying to make your own color so once you got it at your desired length or it's as full and tsukino with leaving a little bit of space at the top to seal it off and go ahead and down a little bit make sure you go around the sides everything's solid and try to turn it opposite of the ways wrapped around and then boom you got yourself your own little at home 20 newbie yeah Phil it's not meant it's a little crooked looking like a witch's finger but it'll do the job and if you don't believe me let's spark up now I'm eating today so I'm really looking forward to both this joint cause I'll hit it harder and then afterwards finally I'm to eat all that food I was telling about it's gonna be lit so we'll montage it to me smoking and then a little bit of that and then maybe whatever the rest is for my day let's close this one out sounds good sounds good to me I don't know how longer shorts this is gonna be but hey I appreciate you

the goods and then faintly quit as well Tim milk strawberry vape juice and I've got a 1 gram from hemp elf lemon skunk see a shouts hemp elf was sending all this over but this was a little wild I've been meaning to get a video done but as I said on yesterday's video I've had a lot of stuff on the plate in a minute so I've had a hard time last cut the works not gonna lie it's been stressing about things things that don't even really matter I don't know why I'm getting stressed out over it so obviously some things do matter but yeah just a little things all build up the line you're not getting stressed out over nothing so today I'm going to be doing the review on the skittles pre-roll see just over the lake just for my I'll get out there nice of you it's really really flooded over here like this water levels risen about a foot it's nearly at the Perimeter lake as well so a lot anymore and it's gonna just go over you can see it all coming out here yeah I'm gonna do some fishing zone when the weather sucks itself out a bit have a look at this pre-roll it's come sealed as well so you know it's not being tampered with well one second guys a bit awkward where I'm trying to do this see if it goes I look at the pre-roll if he was to come for the pre-roll as well I think the roach they say broach on there they some bro dogs absolutely filthy wow that is really nice the terpenes on that is crazy I smell so sweet [Music] it's really tightly rolled as well so there's plenty in there hard to get fun out of it to be honest [Music] burned him very strange I know so into it Bernal at before to be honest so that we cherries just come straight off [ __ ] massive cherry as well ice better now now after that cherry off from the a up again third panes on this crazy don't even say start a proper join it's nice a bit funky I like it I CBD isolate terpenes Monica cannabinoids for Wayne percent see woody I'm gonna keep the job as well so when I've got joining the pocket just use that tube site don't get destroyed in pocket Matt Saunders join me pocket get down the road because obviously rolling indoors smoking out so I get round the corner and it's a lot bent up and [ __ ] it's not very strong this joint it's not very strong at all there's hardly any froggy to it also you psychopath and they don't really fall out you've had nothing I look look at that guy's they still just came straight out I took a puff on it and then when I went to take the Jordan at the mouth it all just fell out so yeah it's pretty well it's a no from me it's a shame that he's so mad at what it looks like looks a bit fairy there's a bit weird that's not markup at say to be quite honest pretty disappointed really I didn't bring our Ritter's out cuz I thought I'll just be smoking that but now I can't do this to step and look at the cherry their cherries come off and all that just came flying out we side that properly we pulled it on the camera now it's quite funny now um yes really make me down there as say yeah I've got the lemon skunk and that bike and irises on me and I haven't got a vaporizer to use this or add a brick or anything for this I've got a vibe indoors I can use with this stuff with I thought I can use no no no I can't use liquor with me I can only use like Chateau or flower see I'm not doing of a pity hour later on just on the shower or just video on the lemon skunk before but I'll do another one back in a second guys CS bit disappointing that is not sure how that says yeah pretty well hard to buy but if I balled out I think Oliver would have definitely made a complaint because hemp elf sent me all this over yeah big shots who fares from hemp health is really sort of me out with all this stuff see ya anyway I'll do another review at the lemon skunk because it someone ages ago I don't know if it's the same the same sort of a fee no it could be a different fee no or different Bachelor together so I don't know it might be a different supplier see I'll try the review on that this stuff as well and I'll do a video of the fake liquid this is going to be a standard shortly flavor liquid anyway so there's no expiry date written on there what's the percentage 500 milligrams called doubting me now is from obviously being out in the woods and that yeah I can't believe that that little thing one in there don't think it's done oh well I sort of a stick oh right I does it downer right well I've never had that happen before all these years I've smoked joints on that I've never had a joint fall out totally like that so yeah if you want someone to roll your joints for ya just hit me up and I'll roll it onto pretty rolls for you if you want them but now I definitely get I looked in so and see what's going on there because I think they're nothing at the ordinary that I wouldn't over normal join and I just fell straight out say a bit of a disappointment yeah guys if you want to pick up anything from hemp elf I'll leave me uh discount codes in the description go check out himself they're one of the number one seaworthy sites in the UK have a little quick look at this lemon skunk no I know I'll save it for the other video that's really let me down that sorry guys the point in this video really but I think she's seen a didn't know like things that went on the camera but yeah the taster for that it tastes a bit like herbs or actual herbs that you've gone by in the shop a lot a bit of time that's what I'm getting there the office ice the nice won't really sweet when it when I opened it up and that so I thought it's gonna be nice and I disappoint him still oh well anyway guys I'm gonna do seven it would [ __ ] out over the like so I didn't bring the reasons when I was above a lemon skunk draw it up that's we're in orbit eyes", "oWNsh4to9mk": "welcome back to my channel you already know what it is all about the Smokies basically I just got these bass leaves yesterday strawberry-banana and I got a great know that matter of fact I want to know which ones with y'all which one out of these two would you try first strawberry banana or grape I really don't want to I really don't know which one I will try first I really just wanted to just spark them on both at the same time but I'm not gonna do that I'm probably gonna smoke this grape one but before I do a video or Instagram I'm gonna pour up some legal Carmen no I'm sayin so you out of it so you need a cup well ice pour up into and down this up in a refrigerator so you know I got that warm Southern California cooler which is warns in Pine that wolf G lot of pork in a minute but they make a sandwich so boy out does make me a sandwich you no more of this cuz then doubt real quick for a long history grand video put a little clip of it up in here not too much and I kind of get copyright because I got that music but uh let's get it this is what this video is about is about these base Leafs right here I ask y'all to calm it what flavor would y'all smoke strawberry banana or great first if you had to decide out of these two flavors you had these two flavors what would you smoke first crepe with strawberry banana now if you haven't comedy yet let me know if you can't decide then we're in the same boat but really I have to decide and since I have to decide I'm gonna smoke this great one I really wanted this robbery banana just because I like strawberry bananas as a cool ass flavor I like strawberry banana I'm not saying but let's get it with this great one so I already manicured this little part off right here it just had like the way he wrote it was perfect you know how they roll it just had a little bit's back though I don't really like sparking it with the back on and so I manicured that off and what I want to tell you all is can barely hear it crunch right that means it ain't to drive what else I want to do is I don't want to make this any shorter but let's just check out the quality of the weed in here just before we do it it's because that's a good thing to do so look I cut that and didn't really do no damage to it like that's just how moist it is do alright so you know I want to check out this weed real quick alright and let me tell you something I just realized up in here this is two grams of flour 0.3 a moon rock no reason why I'm saying that now is because I see some moon rock right here so it says moon rock there's some moon rock I can see it this weed looks pretty good the quality of the weed looks pretty good I'm not gonna lie let's park this up and this right here me let me get I'll drink this alright let's spark this up a little bit moonwalking her so she's gotta hit it a little bit you know [Music] you no longer should to start running a kid alright then alright then super-smooth right off the bat smooth and it tastes good right legit now see this thing gives me hot and I smoke one of these before and I actually got me high so I don't doubt that this ain't gonna get me high but let's see if it does taste that great got me coughing basically you got me copy homie no check dumps check out that ass nice turn a white that means that the that the weed in there is cured correctly not not as the wheat just tastes good it was cured correctly this rap tastes good I can taste the weed in it and of course it kind of gets a little overpowered I want to say to overpower it but of course it will get overpowered a little bit by the rap flavor but of course that's why you wrap them in flavorings you know saying different flavor is it your choice right but you can taste that man as a smooth and of course you just seem that hit me within like the whoop first three hits let me say this again man big shout-out to the Humvee basely big shout-out but I really like these right here anymore like food I was really hit it at first you see how take a bit for it to hit I was really going sorry there's all kinds of smoking from the camera I don't I can't tell I'm just paying attention booty right here me you know me yeah this seems a hitter bro definitely with the moon rock in it I like when people can they roll it up nicely like this is a pre-roll so you know when I rolled up my stuff I liked how I liked it even at all you know sound like just on too much stuff you know I'm saying here and they'll clog it up you know saying like if you put too much moon rock at this end of the at this end of the paper at that end of the paper or too much in the middle I'll get clogged up you're just saying you got to evenly spread that [ __ ] out with oil whatever the case is so this one right here is even not pretty good at the beginning it was a little hard you know I'm saying but that's the that's just the beginning that was roaring fire now let me smoke some of this what y'all know if it gets me hot just been chilling here smoking this got me pretty hot so I'm gonna say this definitely I definitely like this super smooth taste good the weed was good good quality weed I said I checked it out which on everything it had moon rock in it I drop something under there but you can see it in there you can see the oils and you probably can't really see it but you see the oils you know I'm saying as you're smoking it you know what I'm talking about and then it's just hitting good wasn't rolled too tight wasn't rolled too loose so I'm gonna say I mean I'll give it in in the moon rocks were separated you know I'm saying pretty good like it wasn't too much clumped up to where I gotta Clark you know saying so I'm not really gonna lie to y'all a [ __ ] database leaves so I'll give it like in a for sure definitely gave it a give it a nine for sure 9.5 I'm saying on a scale from one to ten how could it get better the only way to get better she doesn't say right that's why I give it a nine point five because no matter what you can always you know what I'm saying so whatever I'll give it at 19 on whatever you know saying it's not easy I'm saying oh yeah and I'm high so you already know what it is sale it's a blessed thing motivated shot with a paisley"}
