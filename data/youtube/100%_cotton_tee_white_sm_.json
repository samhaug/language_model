{"Y-Goi_A2CZo": "Today we're talking about our Gildan 100% cotton t-shirt. Now, this t-shirt is our standard, most\neconomical t-shirt that we offer here. It comes in a wide range of colors\nhundred-percent cotton more generous fit than a lot of the more expensive brands.\nI'd say this is our go to shirt for a lot of large events. If you're ordering for a big group go with the one hundred percent cotton. It offers so many colors, it also comes in a comparable ladies\nstyle, so you can also order a ladies style to complement the unisex. Now, more\ngenerous fit, just like I said so just, instead of telling you about it we do have our model here. He's gonna come over and you're going to see what I mean. First off,  more generous fit here, it's not going to be as tailored. There's no side seam, here a lot of the more expensive shirts. A Canvas, Next Level,  American Apparel, Alternative and so on They have a side seam here, which basically is going to be more tailored, more contoured fitting. This is going to be more generous. Also, it is a hundred percent cotton so it's not gonna have kinda that pull to it. It's gonna be more contracting. Which, you don't have to worry about shrinkage and is pretty true to size but, just with that over the\ncourse of a lot of washes, there's a chance it could shrink if you dry it on high So, with that being said this is more of\na one time use shirt or, you know, a few uses. It's not gonna be one that's gonna be your favorite for years to come. In terms of the fit here the sleeve, more generous cut. I wouldn't say it's tapered by any means it is going\nto be a little baggier. Standard length right here it goes kinda down the bicep. In terms of the neckline here, very standard collar, it's gonna be right up on the neckline. The pull of it, it's always gonna come back, it's not going to be very stretchy. It's pretty much just the\nstandard cotton. If you want to step up, we really recommend maybe the Next Level hundred percent ring-spun, the Canvas one hundred percent ring-spun or even the American Apparel those are great kind of step ups. But this shirt right here amazing bang for your buck and nobody's\ngonna complain because they get a great shirt. It's just the soft factor is not all gonna be there. So, you look great in this, Tyler. Thank\nyou so much. On the Coed Monkey Soft Scale we rate this t-shirt a one. Thanks for watching this video. Please let us know if you have any questions because here at Coed Monkey, Soft Matters and so do our customers.", "D8DahUYbK4Q": "[Music] hi guys today I'm doing something much different than I've ever done before I really want to review something very basic and compare it with all different brands I've got a whole bunch of white teas for you guys today they are all crewnecks they are all 100% cotton they're all different price ranges so one of them is like 15 bucks the last one is almost $200 and I want to see if it's actually worth spending that kind of money on such a basic white tea for the record I don't plan on keeping all of them some of them still have their tags attached and that's just a chance for me to be able to keep the ones that are the most distinct from the pack and anything else that I feel is a little maybe subpar I will be returning and none of this is sponsored or gifted everything is something that I purchased myself so I will leave everything linked down in the description below that will list my sizes that I bought as well as my own measurements of my body so you can kind of compare and make a judgement on which size that you would get the first one is from made well this one's 15 bucks on sale right now I have to say it is very similar to a more expensive one that I have in a few minutes so keep watching what I want to talk about with this one is that the fit is really beautiful I like the fact that the shoulder is a drop shoulder which means that the sleeve isn't very long but it looks longer on me that's a preference of mine I like for my sleeves to be a little bit longer I also think that this shirt this fabric is very much more on the see-through side of things it's less opaque so it looks more like you would see a white bra through it so I think that that's another preference if you like to have your shirts be maybe more breathable and you don't mind if your bra shows a little bit then this would be a good option I like all sorts of tees I like really thick ones I like thin ones it just depends on the outfit of course with $15 you're not getting as much as you could be with things like ethical standards some other companies that I want to feature today are you know five stars on that realm but this one is just made well so they're making strides on fair trade but really just in their denim Department so far another factor to the fact that it's a see-through shirt it's a very thin material this shirt wouldn't last for you know several years like some of them will that's also something to keep into consideration maybe you aren't looking to invest in a white tee because the t-shirt will become stained over time especially if it's a thin material this next one is from ever Lane it runs 18 dollars right now it again is a very thin material but it's not as thin as the made well one was the fit of it I think is a dream I like the fact that it has like more of a longer sleeve but it's not incredibly long I also like the fact that the sleeves are a little bit tighter and that's just again everything dimension here is preference so judge for yourself on what you like if you like things to have a tighter sleeve or a sleeve that's up higher I prefer them to be longer no matter really how wide they are but I like the look of this one I think because the sleeves are tighter compared to the body that's a really flattering look when I was comparing the feel of each one of these shirts this one was one of the highest-ranked ones on how comfy it is it's very soft it's that pima cotton that makes it so soft there's nothing like that you know it compared to a regular regular cotton of any form this one is so super soft as far as durability like how long it will last I don't think that it will last like a month I think it'll last much longer than that but I don't think it'll last for a couple years just because it's a thinner material and that already will make it more prone to stains and rips and that type of thing I've had plenty of ever lain shirts that are made of this pima cotton material and I find that like my turtlenecks especially they will last about a year and when you think of a turtleneck you're wearing it through several seasons and same with a t-shirt you're gonna wear that spring summer fall at least so those are things to consider I would say that this is a really fair price considered all that I've read about with the good trade they've shown a lot about whatever lanes ethics are and I can link that again down below next is alternative apparel and this one runs about twenty four dollars it's a much thinner material just like the other ones were but this one has a very loose fit so this one's a small on me and I would say that the sleeves have the biggest difference there a shorter sleeve not my preference not my thing it's almost the way that a cap sleeve looks you know when it's just up and angled a little bit more so this one is not really one that I prefer the fit of myself the really redeeming qualities about it is that I think that it's the most comfortable thing it's not the most comfortable out of this pack but this one is right up there with the best of them and I will say too that this one is much more on the you know ethical and sustainable route if you want to go that route then this one would be an option for you to look into this one I'm quite shocked about so this is j.crew it's about 30 bucks I would say that it is so incredibly similar to the made well one the first one but you know what's so interesting is the fit is a little bit different the sleeves don't have that you know you don't have that drop shoulder that's making the sleeves look more flattering I really don't care for the fit of this one at all and I was looking closely and it's already starting to have a hole in it and all I've done is put it on a hanger and wear it around just for this video and it still has the tag on it like I haven't worn this out at all it's an extra extra small it's got that same fabric from made while so it's thinner but I have to say that I think it's just the way that made well has created there's I don't know exactly what they've done but this one is so much more fragile than that one is and the fit of it again not my favorite this is me not that like I made that feel both of these shirts he thinks they feel exactly the same but to me this one just feels just a little bit scratchy err in this case I'm just really surprised because this one is backward I think through July or any for months not only that but it's a best-seller I'm just kind of shocked at this one it's much different than what I would assume it's you know double the price of the made well one if you are torn between the made well and the j.crew one because they are so similar a hundred percent I would say go with the cheaper the made well one before reviewing the tape on all of these I thought this next one was going to be my absolute favorite and I haven't ruled that out yet but I have to say the feel of this one is just like heaven it is so dreamy and comfortable and soft it's so much softer than any of the other ones and so this one is from Quiana it runs about $45 the sleeves on it are very interesting because they are cuffed and they're sewn to be cuffed so you can't uncuffed them unless you take a little you know ditch remover and get that off but I love the look of this it's beautiful you know when you're thinking of the complete opposite and you buy a pack o t-shirts you know in a Hanes bag you wouldn't get something like this like this looks like something hanging up in a really nice shop so that's what I appreciate about this it's very extremely drapey and loose again I'm such a fan of longer sleeves so that one's hitting that box forming it's not extremely long but it's somewhere in the middle it almost has a shine on me too and when I was wearing it's acts like you know that has like a sheen to it and I found that to be really interesting a note about their ethics they're more of a slow fashion brand they're very fair trade and I actually even though it's a thinner shirt I don't think it's gonna fall apart very quickly it's very tightly knit and I think that that will give it a little bit more life to it but I do think that it could stain kind of easily next is redone and this one runs about $78 about a year ago Rhydian gave me a shirt and it was the exact same one it just I wore it to death and so I wanted to buy a new one myself and put it in with this list and just kind of compare it and hold it up against the others so one thing to note is that similarly to the made well in Jake it's got this sort of pattern to it if you look closely it's it's not an even pattern it almost looks like it's this heather color you know the way that it's knit together it's significantly different than the made while j.crew option it seems softer and yet heavier it has detail and the way that they knit this together in the back or sewed it together it looks like it's going to stand up the test of time much longer than some other options I just love the look of how vintage this looks it's just so inspired by that and I feel like I just have a different look about me when I'm wearing this shirt I also think it's great that they're using recycled or upcycle materials which redone is just known for I do think that there is just a couple of other shirts in this pack that I prefer more than this one I will say that this one is a dream it's durable it's got up cycled products that is using fabrics but then also just the fit of it it's gorgeous I would say that probably the way that how long it lasted me the last time was about a year but that was when it started to fade and I wanted something that was just bright white that I could compare against these and honestly I could still return this one and still keep going with my old one just kind of judge that for yourself how heavily you'd use this but I am really incredibly happy with this one this last one is somewhere in between really really expensive and affordable and I know that that's different for everybody but what I mean is it's luxury definitely it's not Chanel expensive but it's not you know much more affordable like the $15 option so this is Jesse kam and it runs about 195 dollars there are some really redeeming qualities about it where I am very tempted to keep it so I will just review those with you first of all it's more of an antique white it's not like a starch crisp clean white and I think that that will make it last a little bit longer because I don't have to try to maintain that brightness if you look closely the stitching on it is a very starch clean bright white which i think is a really unique detail to it then they put extra detail around here where it's like double stitched and the material is extremely thick it is so incredibly thick that I would say that you could definitely wear it in like spring and fall or you know if you're indoors but if you're gonna wear this outside in ninety hundred degrees you'd get pretty warm which might make you sweat and maybe stain the shirt so just kind of think about that but reviewing the tape I would say that this I was just blown away at how different this shirt was cut to make it look on me versus the other shirts the other shirts look more standard you know and that's what you get for what you pay when you wear something like this I was really surprised to see how much different I felt like it looked on me because I wasn't expecting that much of a difference for a basic white tee which is why I wanted I was like curious and wanting to try this example and I do love how long the sleeves are that's like automatically I'm gonna fall in love with anything that has that it's got a really wide cuff on the sleeves and I feel like that's another win like it looks really flattering there and then I because it's such a thick shirt and it's just made with such detail and quality and extra stitching everywhere this shirt is not going to disappear in a few months like some of the more like see-through or cheaper options are going to only last maybe you know a season whereas this one's going to last I could see if you took care of it maybe Scotch guarded at first it would last me you know a couple years at least maybe three years so you are paying for that and if you're more trying to buy less and just like consume less then something like this would be a good option because you're gonna have it forever you know as far as white tees are concerned and there's such a staple that I could see that that would be a really great benefit so Jesse Kim is more small business I think she has like three employees it's made locally in and those are reasons where it goes more into the cost of what you're paying for so look into all of that judge for yourself and just see where each one of these companies aligns with where your values are in those realms but this shirt overall it's five stars on how long it will last the fit of it I am absolutely in love with very tempted to keep it the feel of it I would say is the only thing holding me back from skipping it like five stars because it isn't super soft but I love the feeling of having a thick shirt sometimes you know so going into the ones that I'll be like keeping and returning I love love the Quiana one that one is my favorite I think that it's just such a great price range and I also think that the fit and the feel we're absolutely amazing so I definitely want to keep that one I'm also very tempted with the Jesse cam one even though it's much higher price I could see in the footage the difference of how it's cut compared to any of the others where I feel like okay it's a designer shirt like this one has reason for the price because it's just such a beautifully designed shirt and then the quality of it is right up there so no disappointments there I just you know maybe with time it will get even a little bit softer I wish that was just a little bit softer if it was it would have been my favorite out of the affordable options definitely the ever lane one was my favorite $18.00 and you get an incredible shirt and it's just beautifully cut the the design of it was flattering it's very light weight and it's something that I could wear every single day as for the ones I'll definitely be returning the alternative apparel one just really didn't amaze me enough to keep it just the way that it fit really was a little bit awkward to me and so it's just really not my preference I do think that their ethics are just amazing what it stands for so those are qualities that you might want to invest in and make up your own mind on that my least favorite in the one I'll definitely be returning was the j.crew option I just don't think that it was a good fit I feel like it was poorly put together it was double the price of the made while option and it's you know same company everything so I would rather just go with a maid well one if I was choosing between them I think that the maid well one had a much better sleeve length as far as having that drop shoulder and this one just doesn't have that so definitely not a fan of this one and that's it hopefully you found a shirt that meets exactly what you love maybe there's a certain fit you love or a brand or you know that it's standards behind it or maybe it's just a price point thing for you and all of those things are something to judge for yourself but I definitely have my winners and losers in this pack for my own personal taste and hopefully it just gives you guys insight if you like this sort of video then let me know because I could definitely do this more frequently with different types like maybe jeans or shoes or there's just so many options so give this video a thumbs up if you liked it don't forget to

these\nthree tees. Which one is the softest? This one is $1.50 this one is $2.50 and this one\nis about $3.00. How could you ever tell without touching and feeling\nthem? The softness of a shirt has everything to do with the little details\nthat improve the quality of the fabric. In this video we're gonna explain the\ndifferences between the different grades of cotton. What's the difference between\ncarded open end, ring-spun and airlume combed and ring-spun anyway? We're about to\nexplain why the type of cotton matters and which kind to look for in this\nepisode of our series Us vs. Them. If you like this series so far go on and\nhit that subscribe button. Let's start with the worst type of cotton. It's\ncalled Carded Open End or COE for short. This type of cotton is super cheap,\nmaking it the cotton of choice for the one to two dollar tees of the world.\nIt's scratchy, heavy, stiff... kind of feels like the love child of a burlap sack and\na T-shirt. Now let's move on to ring spun. As fewer and fewer people were willing\nto settle for COE, manufacturers started making ring spun cotton.\nPeople often throw out the label ring spun and combed and ring spun\ninterchangeably, but these types of cotton are not the same. When cotton is\npicked there are a lot of impurities in its raw form. It's a plant so you have\nsoil and plant matter and it's just all-around dirty. If cotton is ring\nsponge but not combed and ring spun it means that all those impurities are spun\nup into the yarn. Whereas with combed and ring spun cotton\nthe raw cotton goes through a refining process to get rid of those impurities.\nWhat ends up happening is you lose a lot of the original cotton, resulting in a\nsmaller yield and costing manufacturers. But in the end you get a much better\nproduct. For you visual learners, just compare this photo (which is like ring\nspun cotton) to this photo (which is like combed and\nring-spun cotton). If cotton isn't combed it results in a tee that is hardly soft\nand a print surface that's less than optimal. Wondering where airlume cotton\nfits in this mix?At Bella+Canvas we go a step further with our airlume cotton to\nachieve something even more premium than combed and ring-spun cotton. First, we comb\nout 25% of the cotton we start with because we have super high standards for\nwhat constitutes as clean cotton. With most combed cotton only a small\npercentage of the impurities are actually removed. Then using only the\nlongest staples of cotton we spin yarn that has less stray fibers resulting\nin the smoothest print surface possible. Bottom line there's no cotton that's as\nsoft as our signature airlume combed and ring spun. So next time you're\ndeciding between a few tees make sure to pay attention to the type of cotton and\nmake sure it's airlume, the most premium blend of combed and ring-spun. It's just\nanother thing that separates Us from Them. Next week in this series we're\ngonna unravel the mystery of why your shirts are shrinking and let you in on\nthe secret as to why ours don't.

before we get started please make sure you guys like share subscribe all that good stuff hit the bell so that you get notified any time that i upload i try to upload at least one to two times a week sometimes more if i have time but at bare minimum one to two times a week um what we're going to do today is we are going to try sublimating on 100 cotton that's right 100 cotton um now i know like the first cardinal rule of sublimation is you have to have polyester but somebody not sure who to give the credit to created this solution um spray solution that you spray onto your cotton shirt and it allows you to sublimate onto the cotton basically the solution that you spray onto the shirt adheres to the cotton fibers of the shirt and allows the those fibers to be able to grip the ink so that you can sublimate on the shirt um is that's the information i got from the person that i purchased the solution from um that was the description that they gave and how it actually works so this is my first time trying it out with you guys i have not tried it on any other shirt before um and i felt like this was a perfect image to do i got this from a young lady in a craft group i'm in i purchased it from her um i can't remember her name off the top of my head i'm gonna have to look at my email and um i will leave her name in the description box so if you're interested in this image you can purchase it from her um but yeah this is the image i'm going to go ahead and use um i am going to mirror this because we know a sublimation we have to mirror i already have it have it sized out i'm going to be doing a 10 by 14 and a half and this is going to be on a large shirt i believe a large fruit of the loom um white 100 cotton shirt so i'm gonna go ahead and get this printed out i'm gonna come back and show you guys how i do it and we're gonna see if it works so stick around to see if we uh get it together all right guys so i am back here um i do have my image printed out here and then i have my this is my cotton t-shirt let me show you it's a haze i'm sorry it's a fruit of the womb platinum 100 cotton t-shirt 100 cotton um so that is what i'm going to attempt to silver on today um i do already have my butcher paper inside of my shirt to prevent any bleeding um okay and then i have my solution here i just put it in a spray bottle it came in a bottle this is the bottle that it came in and i put it inside of this spray bottle it's a hair um i've been using this for like just a water bottle for a while now but i put it inside of this to you know be able to easily spray it onto my shirt and i will link in the description box the etsy shop that i purchased this solution from so you guys can check it out if you want to okay so the first thing i'm going to do because this is cotton i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to do a um i'm going to let roll it and then i'm going to do a quick uh pre-press [Music] make sure my shirt is straight okay i'm gonna do a quick like 10 second um pre-press just to make sure all the moisture is um out of my shirt okay and now because my image is so big i'm just gonna place it on here i'm not gonna cut it i'm not gonna tape it or not i'm sorry i didn't even spray it gotta spray it first i'm just gonna give my solution a shake and then i'm going to spray the whole area you don't want it to be soaking wet you want it to be a little damp and then you gotta wait for it to dry so i'm gonna wait a couple minutes for this to dry and i will be right back okay so my shirt is um completely dry now um yeah it's completely dry now um so now i'm gonna take my image and like i said i'm not gonna cut it or anything because it's just a big piece of paper here i'm gonna place it on my shirt and then i'm going to cover it with some butcher paper like normal my heat press is already preheated 400 400 degrees and we're going to press this for 60 seconds so i will come back in 60 seconds all right so it has been about 60 seconds here my timer is going off i'm really hoping this works i can see the image through the paper that's always a good sign okay so it went through is definitely not as bright though i know for a fact that if i would have done this on a polyester shirt these colors would be absolutely popping and um here's the shirt and the colors are there it looks it looks pretty good okay it doesn't look bad for this to be a cotton shirt it does not look bad but i know if this was on a polyester shirt 100 polyester these colors would be absolutely like shining bright like a diamond but it's not bad it's not terrible it has a little bit of a vintage look to it i don't know if y'all can see but it did take okay so like i said this is the shirt let me show y'all the tag again it is come on camera focus a hundred percent cotton i don't know if my camera is focusing it's a hundred percent cotton shirt this was the sublimation and i'm actually pretty impressed um and because this is like a 90s throwback shirt the fact that it looks vintage doesn't bother me it kind of goes with the theme of the shirt so yeah i'm actually really impressed like i said i will put down in the description box the um the etsy shop that i purchased this solution from um i only purchased a small bottle because i wanted to try it out but i mean if this is the results i'm gonna get then i might go ahead and purchase myself a bigger bottle um but yeah i'll put the etsy shop name down in the description box it's not gonna be a blue link for you to click on it's gonna be an etsy shop name underneath the materials that i put in the description box so yeah and i got this um fruit of the loom shirt i got it from um um i got it from walmart and it's 100 cotton for the loom shirt so but i will put all of my materials down below as i always do thank you guys so much for watching questions comments concerns drop them down below make sure you hit that subscribe button all that good stuff bye", "ZnguoFcG290": "do you know how hard it is to find a perfect white t-shirt I've bought a lot of t-shirts over the years but there always seems to be something off slightly too long slightly too short sleeves a little too big sleeves a little too small easily wrinkles too large of a neckline can any of you guys relate I mean first of all problems right but you know what today is that they this stops because today we are going to find the perfect white t-shirt let's go [Music] okay so here's the deal the objective here is to compare different white t-shirts from different brands ranging from three dollar t-shirts all the way up to eighty dollar t-shirts and the attempts to hopefully find the perfect white team so right now I have a couple of the unit close to pima cotton tease sitting at home and one from Primark and there's one from a skit that should be arriving today so right now we are headed downtown to buy a couple of white t-shirts from hmm Zara costs and a PC and then we'll head back home and compare each of those side-by-side let's go [Music] okay guys so we are now back and we have a total of eight white t-shirts to try on so ranging from the cheapest to the most expensive we've got one from Primark two from H&M one which is their basic white t-shirt and another one that's a regular fit I'm not sure how tough it's gonna be different on those two so we're gonna see that later then we've got one from Uniqlo which is your basic supima cotton white t-shirt then we have two from asket one in extra-small and another one in small if you guys don't know ask it is a brand which makes 15 different sizes instead of the usual five so they basically go from extra small to extra large and then for each of those sizes you can choose between three different lengths short medium or long so I basically got to one an extra small and one in small both in regular length after that we've got one from costs and finally we've got one from a PC which is also their basic white sheet it's called a jimmy t-shirt on their website for sizing purposes know that I am 5 foot 7 tall I weigh 60 kilos and I usually wear the smallest size available in any given brand all right let's get into it [Music] okay so first off we've got this one from Primark it's their basic white t-shirts in extra-small and it's priced at $3.59 truck ssin is quite poor the stitching alongside the body is not symmetrical on both sides and the material is see-through so if you get close you can actually see like my tattoos underneath but I feel like we can expect that from a t-shirt at this price range so overall I probably wouldn't stock up on these as like my essential go-to t-shirt for for everyday use but at this price I mean I would consider wearing it at home if I'm doing some manual labor for example and I know I'm gonna get dirty or if you're really stranded on budget and you want something super cheap and you don't mind that the quality is not really there you can also go for this the fit is actually not that bad so I would recommend this if you're really tight on your budget [Music] alright number two we've got this hmm basic white t-shirt it's their basic cotton t-shirt in extra-small and it is priced at $6.99 that is since most of you guys are in the u.s. I'll be giving the prices in US dollars so it's an extra small but it definitely feels much bigger it's quite long it goes down below the crotch as you can see and it's also quite large on the side so it feels very oversized quite baggy definitely does not feel like an extra small and this fits much more like a medium size than an extra small as for the quality of the material it's a bit see-through but not too much I guess that's okay it feels slightly better than the Primark one but it also does not look like high quality cotton at all okay number three we have this regular fit H&M t-shirt this is super weird guys like I feel like a bat the fit is just really awkward like it's super super long and the sleeves are super tight there's like plenty of excess fabric right here which kind of makes it look really awkward lifts the tag here I'm definitely gonna be returning this one it's also six dollars 99 the other one was a much better fit to be honest even though it was also a little too big alright there we have it [Music] next up we've got Yoona close supima cotton white t-shirt so I've actually been wearing these for a number of years now I've got a couple in whites and then a couple in other neutral colors like Navy and gray they're all in extra-small underpriced that 9.99 for my height at least they fall right about mid crotch which i think is perfect for a t-shirt they're quite slim and they fit nice over the body and the sleeves are just about right I used to think that the sleeves were a little too big because my arms were a bit thin but now to be honest like I've been working out a bit getting a bit of arms and the fit is just perfect overall it's obviously not the highest quality cotton you're gonna have like it's it's slightly see-through and you lose a bit of that softness after like washing it a lot of times like not after a couple of washes but let's say if you had the t-shirt for like six months to a year and you've been wearing it like every week and washing it often you're gonna lose a little bit of that softness in the material but asides from that I've been quite happy with them I think they're a great balance between quality and budget so a $9 98 they're not gonna break the bank but you're still getting really good quality and the fit is nice but with that said the next four t-shirts I've never tried them on in the past so maybe who knows we're gonna find one that's better than this one from Uniqlo let's see what happens [Applause] all right so the next two are both going to be from a skits as I mentioned I go one an extra small and then one in small because they've got those 15 different sizes so you never know when there's that many sizes which one's gonna fit your best so one an extra small regular length and one in small also regular length so this one is the extra small and to be honest it feels super nice the cauda is it's a heavyweight 100% Egyptian cotton it does not look see-through at all and it just feels super nice and super soft onto the body and I keep in mind I haven't washed them yet but they really feel super nice on you lengthwise it does feel slightly too short the extra small it hits like at the crotch and maybe slightly too high on the armpits let's try on the small see if it fits any better be right back all right so now we have the ask it in size small regular length it definitely has a more room than the extra small one especially around the midsection and around the torso area and it's longer it hits about slightly under mid crotch which honestly I prefer the length of the Uniqlo t-shirts the material on this one feels better but I kind of feel like I would want it in between the two you know because it's much roomier on the sides and it's also longer but maybe slightly too long God you guys are gonna say I'm so picky but maybe like if you get an extra small in the longer length would that be better would it be in between the two would it be like super long I don't know okay so conclusion on these two from a skits if you're slightly under five foot seven because I'm five foot seven so if you're slightly under that and a little more thin I think the extra small in regular length would be a perfect fit but if you're slightly taller than me slightly taller than five foot seven and you slightly have a little more mass on you I would go for the smaller and if you're like me I would go for any in between so probably the Uniqlo ones okay let's move on to number seven alright number seven we've got this bonded cotton t-shirt from costs so this one is super big it's definitely much bigger than all the other t-shirts but not big as in ill-fitting big more like long line slash oversized kind of vibe so it would definitely work for a street wear a kind of look with that long line t-shirt maybe like under a denim jacket and you got the t-shirt kind of growing out of it to be honest I really like it it's got these kind of bands at the sleeves and at the bottom of the hem and it fits nicely for an oversized t-shirt like I would definitely not buy like 10 of these and have them be like my staple go to everyday t-shirts but as a more unique piece in my wardrobe I would rock it so it's priced at 60 I think just a second sorry about that it's priced at $45 USD so yeah it's definitely a bit more expensive than the rest but the material feels nice feels supersoft like you can feel that it's like heavy weight cotton drapes nicely over the body if you're into the oversize kind of look and you don't mind putting 45 bucks into a t-shirt I will go for it and lastly we have this t-shirt from a PC in size small and it is priced at $85.00 sir not too surprisingly it also fits a bit long like many t-shirts from many brands because I'm so short but other than that the material feels nice regarding the sleeves they feel slightly big but at the same time they also flare out very nicely and geometrically on the sides like this and although they make my arms look a little small I kind of like the look of it I like the look of how they flare out on the sides but then again is it worth $85 you guys decide for me probably not I probably wouldn't want to spend $85 for a t-shirt but the quality feels nice if you're taller than this like if you're slim if you're thin and you're tall like five foot nine or something this would probably fit you perfectly to be honest because other than the length it fits me pretty nicely all over so it's really only the length that's the problem if you're five nine and slim and you've got the money to pay 85 bucks for a teacher try it on fits nicely quality is good alright now that we have reviewed these eight different white tee shirts also I know that I didn't review one from Zara because I went to the store and couldn't find any t-shirt even not in whites I couldn't find anything in size small I mean in size extra small so sorry guys I cannot review that so in conclusion which one of these brands makes the best white t-shirt in my subjective opinion with my size and my height and my frame and build if we simply take into account the fit of the t-shirt I would definitely go for the unique low ones now if you're bringing the quality of the material and the durability and how transparent it is and how soft it feels to the touch I would go pretty asketh once those felt really high quality to me at a reasonably affordable price compared to like the more luxury brands like a PC like for a skits you get really high quality t-shirt for 40 bucks I'm not saying it's cheap it is expensive for a t-shirt but to get that premium quality fabric I think it's reasonable but then again when it comes to the size and the fits of a t-shirt it all comes down to your own personal body type so only use this as a reference while keeping in mind my size and keeping into account to your body type and how it would likely fit you and there's no better test than simply buying the t-shirt for yourself trying them on and seeing how they fit with that said I hope you guys got some value from this video let me know down in the comments if you enjoyed this style of video it's a bit

One question we get all the time is what t-shirt should I get? That's a tough one. This is understandable because there are literally hundreds of styles out there. Maybe thousands. I don't know can somebody check that? [beep] We're gonna help you decide by subjecting some t-shirts to a series of tests. It's science. So the fabric type of a t-shirt is its most important quality. So that's what we'll be testing Luckily, we can break these fabric types into four main categories and that's what we have right here. 100% cotton. 100% polyester. We've got the 50/50 cotton poly blend and we have a tri blend which is cotton polyester and rayon. Dan, and I will be ranking the shirts for each test and giving the best one a score of four and the worst one a score of one At the end will add up all the points and let you know the overall winner It's the t-shirt test [music] [swoosh] But first let's take a closer look at these test tees. Wait, that doesn't sound.... can we edit? [beep] But first let's take a look at the t-shirts we'll be testing. All right, I'm here with Dan and our first test is all about the feels. It's the feel test. [swoosh] Now what we mean by feel is the softness, the touch, the texture. This is often called the hand. Because you feel it with your hand. So we're gonna test these shirts by feeling them. You ready? [kazoo music] All right, so after some rigorous scientific investigation, we've come to a conclusion on the feel of these shirts. What did you think Dan? Um, I was just drawn with the tri-blend for some reason, you know, it was really soft. Stretchy. Very, very soft. Definitely the softest. Yeah, so I think the try blend is the clear number one. Lightweight, alright. So that's number one, I would agree with that. Number two is a bigger conversation. It's really a hard choice, but I almost think I want to say cotton. I would say cotton. 100%. Alright, so there's our number two. I think, I think poly number three. Alright we'll give poly number three. Alright so that means 50/50 is the last one. it's gonna finish in fourth place. Get outta here! The results are in for the feel test and we have tri-blend in first place taking a lead with it's super softness. followed close by cotton in second then polyester in third and 50/50 bringing up the rear. Okay for the next test we're calling it the wear test [swoosh] And for this test, we're gonna have Dan wear the shirts. Oh, really? Yeah. Alright, let's do it. [clap] Whoa! That was fast. Okay, so this is a 100% cotton. 100% cotton. Feels pretty good. Feels like a standard shirt, nice fit. Not too heavy. Next up will be a 100% polyester. Are you ready? Yup. All right. Let's do it. [clap] Wha--how are you...? It's just....we wanna move this video along you know what I mean? Okay, so polyester... Feels very light, very airy. I can definitely tell that. Next up we have the 50/50. You ready? What are you gonna do to me this time? [clap] What the? This is backwards. Sorry about that. [clap] Ah, okay. There we go. So this is the 50/50. Honestly feels a lot like the cotton. It feels really good. I can't tell if it's lighter or not. It might be a little bit more breathable, it feels like. You like the cotton better? Yeah, honestly, this might be my favorite one so far. Okay, favorite one so far. There you have it. You ready for the next one? I mean do I--? [clap] Whoa! Wow, okay, this one feels great. Really soft. Kind of like the best of what everyone else has had to offer. It's soft enough, it's very light. So what do you think? Hm, okay, so In terms of comfortability,  I'm think going to go with tri blend number one. 50/50, number two. Cotton, number three. And polyester last. But again, that's just my opinion Some people like poly, some people like cotton more. Well, science is all about opinions, so... You're right. That's very true. So here's our scores for the wear test It's tri-blend Once again in first place with its ultra comfortable wearability. Followed by 50/50 in second place. 100% cotton in third and polyester last because Dan said so. Next up We're gonna be stretching these shirts for the stretch test So we're testing the stretchiness of the fabric. And more importantly how it holds up after being stretched it's the way the fabric behaves when we stretch it Looks good stretchy. Let's stretch it up Here's your results for the stretch test Polyester getting the win on this one with its ability to snap back into shape, followed close by try blend in second then 50/50 and third and 100% cotton with a big loss here For the next test we're getting wet It's the wet test Actually, the shirts are getting wet We're gonna time how long it takes for each of these shirts to dry off in the hot Pennsylvania sun Polyester tends to be moisture wicking. So we're gonna see how that does. I have a feeling cotton is gonna lose this one, but we'll see. Let's do it Results of the wet test are in we have polyester in first place again with an easy win followed by tri-blend in second and a surprising third-place finish for cotton and 50/50 with the agony of a wet defeat. Okay, next up. We're gonna see how wrinkle-resistant these shirts are It's the wrinkle test We're both gonna take two shirts, put them on our chair, and sit on them for the rest of the day What? So we're gonna take each shirt and we're gonna ball it up and shove it in a sandwich bag and leave it for 20 minutes And see how it comes out after that 20 minutes later All right, so we got the shirts out of the bag and and they're pretty wrinkly except for this one. clear winner is poly. It was barely even wrinkled. The next one number two would be the Tri-blend here, not too bad at all, I bet these would come out as you wore it for a couple hours 50/50, Hmm Didn't do too well. Pretty wrinkly. pretty wrinkly gonna need an iron for that sucker and then cotton, oh the most wrinkly So that's a clear Clear 1 2 3 4 on this one. Looks like a topographical map. Here's the scores for the fifth and final test of this video It's polyester with another big win. This stuff just doesn't wrinkle it's kind of weird Coming in second once again is tri-blend with 50/50 coming in third and Cotton suffering a humiliating set of wrinkles. That brings us to the halfway point of this competition Let's look at our scoreboard and check the results so far Tri-blend is in the win column with a total of 17 points followed closely by polyester in a surprise second place with 15 points Cotton and 50/50 are tied with nine points apiece, and we'll have a lot of catching up to do in In our part 2 video of the T-shirt Test We will present the final five tests The screen-printing test the DTG test the mess test the wash test and the dangerous damage test, look for that coming soon Click on the items below to get more information about them or start designing on them right now Thanks for watching.

product to look at let's have a look at it right now those of you who do transfer printing like I do and vinyls and stuff like that onto 100% cotton t-shirts the reason why we use concierge is because they're basically half the price of sublimation t-shirts for those of you who actually are in the know now we've got a new product here where I can now sublimate or use sublimation to print onto a cotton t-shirt let's check it out Robin I've just got this test batch of a new product that's out and what they do is provide you with a special transfer paper and some special powder which you put through your sublimation printer in this case it's the year Rico print which we are using and you use the sublimation inks on the transfer paper and then you apply a powder over the top which is like a polymer powder and that then gets pressed onto a 100 percent cotton t-shirt and it's supposed to leave the sublimated image permanently fitted onto the t-shirt now I've not used this before so you're using it for the first time with me so let's give it a try I'm going to get our cotton t-shirt now it's basically for white t-shirts and light-colored t-shirts is this a product by the way it's not for dark t-shirts so let's just get a t-shirt now give it a press and then we'll see what happens right so this is the paper and I know if you can see there it's from a company called subway to cotton comm and again this is just a sample sheet here it's a little bit thicker than the normal transfer sublimation paper so what I'm going to do is to open the tray and you place this facedown in your Rico sublimation printer like that I'll turn it on first obviously and I've just pulled up a color print here of an image it's Lightning McQueen me grandson loves that I'm not going to sell this this is purely to get a good sale good the color definition is in this so I've never tried this before once it prints out the image what you have to do then is to lay the image on a tray and then you sprinkle this polymer powder over the top of it which again I've only got a little sort of bagful here so we plan to do that and cover the ink up that as it comes out of the printer it's obviously still wet and sprinkle that over until all the inks come and then we can actually press the air t-shirt with 100% cotton t-shirt so let's give that a go now and again all I've done is pull up a graphic here of a lightning McQueen cars and the image should come out here wet right as we can see it started to come out now so I'm going to bring the image black straight down in the tray like that and I'm just going to get this white powder now I'm just empty it onto the tray I'm not going to you gotta be careful not to smudge this as well apparently so I'm just going to put the whole lot on for the moment and I'm just going to swish it all about so again I've never done this before so you have to bear with me on this so I'm just going to sort of just try get it all over the top of the image this is all brand new to me and just make sure literally that the whole of the image is covered which I can see there that it is there you go so now we've done there I'm just going to pick the paper up carefully dust it off like that as I say there's no cutting around the shapes either so as you can see here it's just literally just drop it all off and I can see there that everything is actually covered and there's only this residue which is actually just stuck to the image itself I'll just lay that there for a second I've already pre pressed our t-shirt as you know what we always do there and as I say the temperature which I'm pressing it here is 180 degrees and I'm going to be doing that for 30 seconds now you've also got to be careful that when you put this down face down that you don't move it about so you want to be in the correct position really right from the beginning so I'm just going to place that down there like that and cover up with me cover sheet as you can see there now don't forget this is a hundred percent cotton t-shirt which normally you cannot sublimate - so let's just press that down there and we're going to be counting down for 30 seconds now so I've never used this before myself it might seem a bit of a faff but again it's a learning curve and it could be a way of producing I mean the biggest thing about sublimation t-shirts are they normally double the price of these cotton t-shirts right here we go so I'm just going to take it off like that we've had it under for 30 seconds I don't know what it's going to do what it's going to look like and I'm just going to pull this straight off and this is a set view is 100% cotton t-shirt using sublimation inks now look at that first of all I'm going to say to you but then colors are absolutely fantastic look at this look how about that can you see how vivid that is and there's no seams or anything whatsoever there now that looks really nice I'm very surprised by that and look at the depth of the colors as well I'm sure you can see there and as I say this isn't a transfer this is sublimation ink on our Gildan t-shirts which as you can probably see on the sign they're 100% cotton using sublimation inks how about that well all I can say is really that that's erm that's really surprised me I'm a little bit taken aback by that to be honest with you I've never used this before I've heard of the product as I say but this is in the UK at the moment I don't know if you've got it in any of the other countries at the moment I think this the price of these as compared to the normal sublimation or transfer papers I think it's about double the price at the moment but apparently the manufacturers are trying to work to get the price down so it can compete favorably with the the transfer paper market and also you know you'll be saving because these t-shirts are literally dirt cheap as well so I'm think you'll find there's no you can fill a surface there obviously but it's like a polymer surface which you get with any sort of printed surface but that ink is been taken by the polymer power that which is obviously sunk into the actual world garment as well so that's why it's actually part of the garment as well there so well there you go that's a new one on me and if you probably see I'm trying to stretch it there look can you see it's actually stretching because it's actually part of the garment as well there we go look there's no sign of any sort of degradation when you stretch it and well please wait I think I turned that lovely and look at the vivid colors as I've said before well that's just something to looking out for and that is from a company called sublet ooh cotton limited a brand new product here in the UK although I have heard of it before maybe in different guises and it is a polymer powder to be used on top of your sublimation ink with your sublimation printer so that you can actually print on 100% cotton t-shirts there you go I hope that was of some interest to you it will be to me because I'll be running it through to watch many many times and we'll update you obviously somewhere further down the line in a different video there you go hope you enjoyed this one thanks very much for watching don't forget to subscribe to my channel share my videos and we'll see you again in the next video till then bye for now you you", "ZgOX2AjzYZs": "what's going on guys in this video I'm gonna tell you the best cheapest and easiest way to make t-shirts and that sublimation printing on cotton let's not waste any time and get right into it so the first thing you guys will use an epson double you have 7710 printer this printer can easily be converted to a sublimation printer you guys will need the sublimation ink cartridges and sublimation ink and you guys don't need sublimation paper make sure you guys install the sublimation ink cartridges this is not gonna work on regular ink we're gonna go on a website called gypsy shirts and by our 100% cotton t-shirts here you'll need sublimation spray this is basically liquid polyester you can get these cheap on etsy so the first thing to do is mirror image with image image rotation click horizontally and they're gonna print image so the good thing about this printer is that it can fit 11 by 17 paper this is a large paper and is the perfect size to make t-shirts so when the sublimation paper is printed on the colors are not gonna be bright don't worry about this when this transfer onto the shirt is only perfect so the first thing we're gonna do is preheat the shirt after that's done we're gonna spray the show with the sublimation spray I'm gonna let it dry for around 20 minutes make sure you guys spray the entire area where the image is and if you transfer also don't worry about spraying outside of that area anything that sprayed outside is now going to be visible when the shirt is done next one alignment to the t-shirt to make sure it's straight you guys can tape it if you want just make sure the tape is not go on the heat press we're gonna place the image onto the heat press we wanna put the silicone paper on the heat press and we're gonna press it at 350 degrees for no less than one a minute also make sure you guys add a decent amount of pressure will present with sublimation you guys have to press it for at least a minute because if you don't the full image is not going to be transferred and it's going to look Peyton if you want a bright vivid image you have to press for at least a minute now we're gonna move the silicon paper remove the sublimation paper and our shirt is finished take a look at how bright and perfect and vivid the shirt came out so because the shirt is seldom mated the colors will never wash out so this shirt costs around $1 80 cents to make if you guys want to slow show it's online in my opinion this is the best way to do it you guys can easily sell these for over $10 also make sure you guys have Ward the Amazon sublimation sprays these are complete garbage the image quality is gonna be horrible and also this fray when it's dried out is gonna make the image surface hard so definitely make sure you guys award these another thing you guys should avoid is these sublimation powders the whole process is super messy and the end result is garbage also it's a hustle because even though the powder is cheap you guys cannot sublimate on regular sublimation paper you will have to buy special silicone paper otherwise it's not gonna work and these silicone papers for 11 by 17 they cost around $4 per sheet so again if you guys want high-quality results use the Etsy sublimation sprays and you're good to go I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did please hit the like button and subscribe and I'll see you guys on the next one", "yHHWooStqT8": "damn that's a good fit man who doesn't have a white t-shirt in their wardrobe it's a classic goes with everything you can wear it all the time as a base layer no matter the season and i don't know about you but when it comes to important staples like these i want to make sure my t-shirt is high quality durable and with a perfect fit the shoulders need to sit right it needs to be the right length the right sleeve length and it just needs to sit nicely on your body but what exactly is that perfect fit you ask today we answer that question [Music] first off let me start by saying that there's not only one type of fit for t-shirts depending on the way you like to style them and your personal preferences i'd say you can place them into two categories number one a standard slim fit which is the one we'll delve deeper into and number two an oversized fit the oversized fit has more flexibility in terms of how it can fit due to its oversized nature obviously it doesn't matter as much or at least it won't be as noticeable if the sleeves are a little longer or the body is a little wider than intended as long as it has a roomier body longer sleeves and drop shoulders it should look pretty good so in today's video i want to focus more on the standard slash slim fit and why do i say slash slim because that's how it fits it's not baggy it's not skin tight it gently hugs your body in the most flattering way and i say standard because this is your basic t-shirt fit if you're not going for the oversized look and you want that perfect tailored fit that you can wear with anything on its own as a base layer underneath other layers this is how you want your t-shirt to fit and in order to showcase the perfect fit i've partnered with son of a tailor if you've not heard of them before son of a taylor is a clothing tech company that makes custom fitted garments as you know no two bodies are the exact same we're all shaped differently and sometimes the standard five or six sizes offered by most brands is just not enough to fit all body shapes and sizes so son of a tailor customizes the fit of your t-shirt to fit your unique body and they even have a perfect fit guarantee so if they don't get it perfect on the first try they'll go back to the drawing board and make the slight adjustments required to get it to perfection so i tried their service made a custom t-shirt based on my height age weight and measurements and after one round of revisions i present to you my perfectly fitting white t-shirt the shoulders are 42 centimeters wide and you can see the shoulder seams sit right at that natural point where your shoulder ends and your arm starts this is exactly where you want it to be to achieve that perfect fit the sleeves come down to hit that key mid bicep area i wouldn't go any shorter or longer than this for a standard fit and with my measurements they're about 20 centimeters long in case you're the same height and that interests you now the torso is where you really want to get that sizing perfect anything overly loose will start falling into oversized territory which is a great look but it is a different type of fit and in that case you kind of want everything to be oversized not just a torso area but you also want to be careful not to go too tight you just want it to gently hug your chest without feeling constraining at any point when you move around the chest width for my custom fitted t-shirt is 49 centimeters as for your waist area you probably also want to have a different width here than your chest because unless you're literally shaped like a stick most often you'll either have a bigger belly in which case you'll need to increase the waist with or you'll have a slimmer waist than your torso and you'll need to have a slight v taper finally let's talk about the length of the t-shirt i get ocd about t-shirt length because the problem is if it's too long it looks like a dress and if it's too short you can't tuck it in without it coming out whenever you raise your arms and that is the worst the ideal length is about mid crotch that way you can wear it both tucked and untucked and it'll look great both ways and for me the perfect length is 64 centimeters when it comes to white t-shirts especially you want to make sure it's a high quality material the two most common problems i always look for are see-through material that is my biggest pet peeve having a see-through white tee and number two distortion or change of shape after washing it the latter is obviously harder to check for because you can't notice it until after you cut the tags and washed it but let me tell you i have this one primart and it did not last long after only a couple of washes it completely lost its original shape however the son of a tailor medium weight cotton t-shirt passed both tests with flying colors it's fully opaque and so far i've washed it three times and it looks brand new but with that said cotton is not the only material you can go for son of a tailor can also make them in wool yes you heard that right 100 merino wool t-shirts it's actually surprising how comfortable a good wool can feel to the skin and it gives off a more luxurious feel and then you have the tensile t-shirt stencil is one of the most sustainable materials out there and it's more breathable than cotton and great at wicking moisture away from the body so it's perfect on those days when you're moving around a fair bit but it doesn't actually feel like sportswear so you can even wear it with the classier looks you also have the peak t-shirts which are made from supima cotton and have a waffle knit texture which is normally used for polo shirts i'd say this is a great choice for the more sportswear inspired looks or just to add some interesting texture to a simple outfit and finally the standard cotton tee which you've been seeing also comes in heavy weight which can be a good choice for the colder months fabric choice plays a huge role in the final result of your t-shirt and you can really play around with different fabrics depending on your style and personal preferences i'm a sucker for the classics so my favorite probably has to be just a standard medium weight cotton t-shirt but whatever your style is you have your pick of the lot hopefully you now have a better understanding of what to look for in a t-shirt in terms of fit and fabric i've been there before where i didn't really know how things were supposed to fit and i would have liked to watch a video like this so i sincerely hope it helped and if like me standard sizes don't always fit you well and you have trouble finding that perfect fit off the rack i could not recommend son of a taylor enough feel free to check them out by going to the link in the description all of their clothing is made in europe and their t-shirts in portugal and of course they don't only make white t-shirts although that is my go-to color and i love white they also have the other go-to neutrals like black navy and different shades of gray and they even make long sleeves henleys polos sweatshirts and more hope you enjoyed the video guys i wish you a beautiful day keep on dressing with intention and i'll see you in the next video peace i just broke the chair this for a standard fit and for ah damn there's not only one type of fit for t-shirts [Music] and i say uh i feel like the light has changed isn't it brighter than before oh man come on the", "aAOC71qqXxM": "- [JJ] Oh, my God.

But I do like your dress sense. - I'll take your sympathy. - No, I do like your look. You're dressed a little bit different, like your dungarees. So I felt like I should have worn mine. So yeah, you go. - Hi, I'm Josh. I'm 26. And you're the kinda girl that makes me wanna tidy my room. - Cool.\n- What?! - Neither do I. That's how I feel. - Cool. Yeah. (bell dings)\n(Sidemen cheering) - Hello, I'm Harry. I'm the youngest in the group here. But when I was very young, my dad was driving a car, and he ran over a rabbit, and it didn't fully kill it. It was like... on the road a lot. So he went, he got like something at the back of the car and put it out of its misery. And so I've seen some when I was a kid, so I'm quite mature for my age. (Sidemen laughing) - Apart from the fact you're still wearing socks and sandals. - Yeah. - Bye. (buzzer buzzes)\n(Sidemen laughing) It's not a look. - My name's Vik, and I've heard that\nTinder's a numbers game. So can I get your number? - Aww. (chuckles) (Sidemen exaggerating) Yeah, I was always really\nbad at maths in school, so I don't really\nunderstand what you said. So it's that way. - [Harry] That sounds\nlike an English problem. - My name's Ethan. I'm 24. And you're very pickup-able. - Oh no.\n- Oh - Oh God. You've been here all day, haven't you? - You're struggling, mate. - It's been a long day, yeah. It has been. Yeah. - Do you know what? Yeah. - That's pretty cool.\nI appreciate that. (upbeat drill music)", "qYbs7pPwhho": "what's up guys it's going from gentlemen but then a channel dedicated to helping men dress better and feel their best and in this video I'm going to be reviewing Yoona clothes two people cotton t-shirts stay tuned so you know clothes - pima cotton t-shirts have a bit of reputation in the menswear community in fact any discussion around you know the best t-shirts for men is sure to include this highly regarded tee and some men swear by them while others just don't really understand the hype I bought four pairs of Yoona clothes supima cotton tees and so you know you kind of know where I stand in that camp but we got grey we got heather gray white and navy even with all the high praise nothing is perfect and so let's dive right in with this Uniqlo supima cotton tea review in this review i'm going to cover the t-shirts of style and fit shirt quality comfort and durability how well they've held up over several years of wear you know the pros and cons and as always if you want a deeper dive head on over to gentlemen within i'm gonna link that down below and then you can read more about it cuz it just showed I own four unit clothes - pima cotton tees for reference I've had the white and navy shirt for around four years now and the two grey shirts for about two years so exactly what is pima cotton well it's a type of cotton that's actually grown and sourced in the United States it represents less than 1% of cotton grown in the world and it's a unique sort of cotton due to the extra long fibers that contribute to its premium properties of strength softness and color retention the facts pima cotton is lighter and 45% stronger than regular cotton and it provides superior comfort durability and softness for the shirts style you know clothes pima tees are as clean and minimal as a shirt it's going to get it has zero branding no logos on it except for on the back tag where it's printed you know where it's made in the Uniqlo logo they come in all the basic neutrals of white gray Navy and black all in all you're going to find 14 different colorways but the wide ranging shades from olive green and yellow to red and cobalt blue there's no shortage of options to choose from here in terms of the shirts of fit you know I've said it before and I'll say it again Uniqlo the pima cotton t-shirts are some of the best of fitting t-shirts that i period they're fitted without being skin tight and have an overall clean drape the body length is spot-on hitting around mid fly and the sleeve length is also perfect landing around mid bicep the sleeves also hug my biceps just the right amount without being restricting I can't say it enough but Uniqlo supima cotton tees were actually the first t-shirt to actually fit me pretty impeccably off the rack before discovering them you know I was wearing these cheap-ass H&M tees for like $5 and the sleeves way too short and so they were always riding up and then you can see my armpit hairs and when I put them through washes the fabric just kind of got all distorted and it just did not hold up over time and so when it comes to the fit of these shirts I can't speak more highly of them some of the product details that actually comes in double x-small all the way up to triple XL and so you know there's a wide range of sizes here however they don't carry any tall sizes so if you're a really tall guy you know over six-foot some you might have some trouble with you know clothes shirts which is you know something I encountered when I was you know doing some research on forums a lot of guys on reddit some male fashion advice the taller guys were saying that the fit just you know wasn't there for the product details Uniqlo says that it's you know hundred percent supima cotton and it has a glossy Sheen with a premium feel there really is no glossy Sheen this shirt is not shiny at all however it does have a premium feel under percent supima cotton and these shirts are made in Vietnam not us which is kind of weird because supima cotton is sourced in the US so I'm not sure you know what's happening there now let's dive right in with the shirts Comfort so Uniqlo supima cotton tees are really soft and they actually get softer and softer after every wash it's a nice mid weight cotton and it is not see-through by any means you know comparatively it's not as thick as you know Banana Republic pima cotton t-shirts or ask it but it's thicker than brands like Express ever Lane and even the mountain bowed rigs t-shirts that I reviewed in you know my best t-shirts roundup in terms of where the shirts have been through dozens upon dozens of wears over the years I can tell you that they've held up supremely well they've gotten softer over time as I mentioned before and you know there are no holes in the shirts so that goes to show you that even a ten dollar t-shirt can withstand the test of time and get better over time and so price isn't always going to be a factor when it comes to finding quality comfort we're just gonna get right into the durability of the shirts had them for a couple of years now plenty of washes as I said before and the shirts have no holes in them they're not weirdly distorted or warped through many washes the shirts still have a clean drape and a nice fitted aesthetic I would say that the durability of these shirts are really good and they've held up really well over the years but it's not all perfect though and assurance actually do fake considerably over time especially the colored shirts and so my Navy shirt I would say more saturated colors are gonna fade over time with washes and dry cycles so the Navy is not as saturated as it was before that's going to knock it down a few rounds all in all though Uniqlo Supima cotton tees have proven to be immensely durable over the years where you can buy them you can shop online at Uniqlo comm or you can hop into one of their brick-and-mortar locations they have locations all across the US and so you know if you have one near you go in get fitted and see how the Uniqlo supima tees fit on your body all right so let's finish it up with some of the pros and cons for the pros best bang for your buck at 990 a shirt crafted with long-lasting high-quality supima cotton one of the best fitting t-shirts that I own period classic crew neck and v-necks in a myriad of colorways can conveniently shop online or in-store for the cons not the best for tall guys you know no long sizes and color shirts they're gonna fade quite a bit over time and it may be too sheer for some people it's not really thick material here if you have any brands that you feel are a better value you know leave some comments down below and let me know but yeah in the end Uniqlo supima cotton tees have a reputation for a reason with a price point of $10.00 and high-quality long-lasting product Uniqlo supima cotton tees are really hard to ignore and so it's definitely one of those staple pieces in my wardrobe by under $10 it's hardly an investment piece and so feel free to go crazy there with all the colorways and yeah it's all I got for this video if you liked it smash

"f4I0wJsCBNc": "[Music] hello guys welcome back to miss sugi lovecraft and today um what i'm going to show you is um how you could make your own spray for sublimation on cotton shirt and what i have here i use our 20 pound paper to print my image as you can see 20 pound paper to print my image i also got from the dollar store a bottle spray bottle um this is the mini wax poly acrylic um water base got this from amazon it's the eight fluid ounce i want to say it was eleven dollars i got some water it is eight ounce which is one cup of water and i got my tablespoon measuring um spoon what i'm gonna do is i'm go i'm not gonna put it in my um my measuring cup because this is what i use in my kitchen so i won't do that i mean you'd probably have to get one just for that but what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna pour let's first let's see let's make sure this fits in this bottle so here we go i didn't check that first but it does fit in the bottle then i'm going to get my poly acrylic let me probably shake it up a little bit get my poly acrylic and i'm going to put two tablespoon inside here all right two tablespoon inside there gonna close it up i'm gonna shake it up this is a way you could make your own spray for sublimation to put on your cotton t-shirt shake it up well okay i'm gonna spray the shirt and i'm gonna show you and i'm gonna spray the shirt here is the shirt that i'm gonna be using it's a hundred percent cotton okay a hundred percent cotton hopefully you can see it 100 cut okay i put a piece of paper in between because i don't want to have it soak through so i'm going to spray the area so guys i had to change the spray top on this dollar store bottle and i had another spray top so i kind of cut it because you want it to have a spray effect for you to spray out and the dollar store one wasn't working so i'm going to spray the area now and the white paper underneath kind of let me gauge to where i'm gonna spray okay so i'm gonna let it dry and then i will show you once i put the put my image once again like i said i um put this on regular 20 pound paper i kind of got a little bit of the the poly acrylic on there but that doesn't matter right now we just wanted to show you that it will work so you don't have to buy thirty six dollars for four ounce bottle you could get the poly critic mini wax poly acrylic and probably a dollar store spray um bottle a tablespoon to measure and like i said a 20 pound paper so all of this saves you a whole lot of money okay so i'm gonna get this and i'm going to once it's dry we'll be right back to show you the effect so guys here is the moment of truth remember 20 pound paper um printed um with sublimation ink and i am going to put this on the shirt you could um use your heat resistant tape and tape it down so it doesn't move i'll go ahead and do that smooth it out all right so i heated up my press to 385 and i'm going to press it at 60 seconds all right guys here's the moment of truth let's see voila well of course i didn't mirror the jamaica so it's upside down but guys the fact that it came out and it came out beautiful i love it um it worked so don't laugh at me i didn't mirror image the um the print i was so excited to try this out so thank you for watching once again this is miss sugee lovecraft don't forget to like subscribe and share [Music] you", "jD9PT402sAc": "[Music] all right guys so i'm going to walk you through a process of making a shirt the first thing that you're going to want to do or at least what i do is i turn my heat press on it needs to be to 400 degrees and this takes a little bit so while i'm printing my designs and getting things ready i just wait for that to heat up all right so i'm going to go ahead and print a design okay so we're going to hit start creating and we are going to go to the files that we have already loaded onto our computer and the design that i need right now is the halloween town and chill so we're going to select that one and it will already have your measurement set over here depending on the size of paper that you're using so then you're going to hit print and then it'll give you another screen after this to start the printing process okay so now we just wait for it to give us the next prompt to print okay so this is the screen that's going to come up next and you can adjust the size and it'll let you know if the size is too big so that's probably as big as it's going to let me do it you can also adjust your colors here if you need to sometimes i bump up the orange and the yellow all right so then we're going to hit how many copies we need this is something that i sell a lot of so i'm going to go ahead and do 10 copies of that and then we're going to hit print and our printer will start printing all right so the heat press still has about nine degrees to go um so i was going to go over the shirt with you really quick so i am going to be using a dark shirt so the design obviously is not going to show up that well but i am going to be bleaching this shirt um so as i've said before you need to make sure that the shirt that you're using is at least 65 polyester so the shirts that i typically use are the gildan soft style you can see on the tag that it is 65 polyester all right and then going over my heat press a little bit this is a newer one that i've just got so this one pulls out on the bottom and that way you can lay your shirt down lay your design down line everything up so you're not underneath here burning your hands so while we wait i'll go ahead and lay my shirt down and we can go ahead and place the design and you can either use the butcher paper or the teflon sheet right now i'm just going to be using the teflon this is just to protect the shirt from getting scorched because of the high temperature that we are using okay so we're going to lay that down it's taking about 10 minutes for the heat press to get up to 400 you can either do 55 seconds or 60. um here lately i've been doing 60 seconds i think that it just helps get all the ink onto the shirt and when you get a heat press you want to make sure that your pressure is correct the way that they recommend doing that is the paper test so you could take a piece of computer paper and put your heat press down and make sure that the piece of paper when it's like shut on there can't be pulled out so it needs to be tight enough to keep a piece of paper underneath there all right so we're just going to go ahead and press it it's still probably has two degrees to go but it's all right so we're going to push that back in there and we're going to push it down and it's going to count down while we wait okay all right so we're going to lift it up pull this out it's going to be really hot but make sure that you remove the design as soon as it's done to prevent any ink from smearing around and then here's your design okay so when you bleach the shirts you want to make sure that you're putting something in between them i have all these cardboard cutouts that i've made to put in between the shirts so the bleach doesn't bleach through you can also find these at hobby lobby for 1.99 if you don't want to make your own i typically bleach about 17 shirts at a time just because i had so many orders so yeah okay so i just take i'll probably cover my microphone so i just take this shirt and cover it or cover the piece of board with it just like so and then i'll end up taking all of them and laying them out and the bleaching process works best in full sunlight you will get your quickest process if you have sunlight onto the shirt it will take twice the time if you don't have the sunlight all right so now we're going to bleach this is the bottle that i use it is a glass bottle i will put a link to that i got it on amazon you got two of them before i started using this i was just using a mrs meyers bottle that i cleaned out and put bleach in i just use straight bleach some people will mix water but yeah it's just straight bleach and i will completely coat the design i will completely coat the design and then i just go through and splatter all around it and then once once this once this bleaches i will flip the shirt over and i will do the other side i do this because sometimes it will bleed through and it just makes it easier if you have both sides done just in case that happens now that they're all sprayed they're going to take about 15 to 20 minutes if we were in direct sunlight right now it would happen almost immediately but as you can see some of the gray ones are orange and we want them to have more of a white tint so we're going to let them sit until they turn a little bit white and then we're going to flip them over and do the other side after that we will put them into the washer using only detergent no fabric softener and then dry them and they'll be ready to go okay now that they're lightened up enough we're going to flip them over and repeat the same process on the back so [Music] so [Music] you", "HYHZoStagGE": "hey guys we're going to do an instructional video for irrelephant creations spray bright sublimation spray i have gotten a lot of requests to do a how-to or instructional video so i figured i would go ahead and give it a shot um first i want to go over quickly the things that i use to sublimate i get a lot of questions about what do i use and what works best for me so i have an epson 77 or the workforce 7710 printer that i converted into a sublimation printer i got the conversion kit on etsy it works great for me i currently use printers jack ink from amazon but i am in the process of flushing out my system and switching to cosmos ink i don't really have any problems with printers jack it has worked great i just hear a lot of good feedback on this cosmos ink and how much brighter it is so i want to give it a try but i can't speak on that yet because i have not tried it yet i also have the fancier studio 15 by 15 heat press there are 200 on amazon it works great i've had no issues out of mine whatsoever this is actually my second one the first one lasted me about four years and it was a trooper because i put it through a lot and when it comes to sublimation paper i don't use sublimation paper i use hammer mill multi-purpose copy paper i get the 11 by 17 because my printer fits up to 13 by 19 and that's just the size that i prefer now this is not a sublimation paper but i have done several tests and trials and this works great for me and it's very cost effective it's like 12 dollars for an entire ream so that is what i use for my sublimation that is also what i use to cover my sublimation when doing a sublimation on a t-shirt i do not use butcher paper or wax paper or parchment paper or whatever it is they say they want you to use i've always just used copy paper and it's always worked great for me um and of course i treat all of my shirts with spray brite and whenever i use my peroxide mixture i'm just using regular hydrogen peroxide that you get from the dollar store or from walmart and i'm mixing it with water so now that you know everything that i use um i guess we're gonna jump right in i'm going to show y'all how to pour in the spray i get a lot of questions on do we need to mix it um how much water do we mix it with and the answer is no no no it comes ready mixed for you so that you don't have to worry about ratios mixing you don't have to worry about any of that all you have to do is shake shake your bottle to make sure there's no residue at the end at the bottom you shake it up real nicely i guess i shouldn't have this heating under the press because it looks like it's trying to melt okay and then we're going to take our spray bottle we're not adding any water just straight from the bottle transferring it into our spray bottle this spray bottle already had a little bit of spray right in it all right and spray bottles in order for spray brite to work you need a decent spray bottle your spray bottle needs we prefer these these are offered in our store it has an adjustable nozzle so that you can adjust how heavy or light your mist is because in a spray bottle with a spray brite you need a bottle that can do a heavy mist a heavy even mist um and as well as a spray bottle that can handle something a little thicker than water going through the spray nozzle and i always suggest after each use to take your spray bottle just take your spray nozzle off like this put it in a cup of water spray this down the sink like if you um if you put it in a cup of water like this and hold it over the sink and spray it a few times then that's going to run water through your nozzle so that the spray brite's not going to harden up in your nozzle and i know that sounds like a pain but it is 100 worth it if you've gone through a hundred bottles spray bottles um because i forget i forget and then it clogs up and it is almost impossible to get them unclogged or i guess i haven't found a way to get them unclogged so i just like to rinse them out these spray bottles are available in our shop uh with certain purchases of the larger items and this is not the one that you have to have for spray right to work this is what i have found through trial and error this is what i prefer and i like my customers to have a good spray bottle because it really does affect the quality of the shirt and the outcome if you have a spray bottle that is streaming that is not spraying evenly that is spraying too splotchy then your design is not going to come out it's your spray bright is going to spray thicker in some areas lighter in some areas and that is going to come for or call for a splotchy design so i recommend these bottles but if you can find a good bottle that has a good heavy even mist perfect also i use a rubber roller to rub the spray into the shirt these are this particular one was about nine dollars on amazon and i will show you a way to use i will show you a way to sublimate without the roller but i have found the roller just to be more time efficient and convenient okay so what we're going to do is we're going to spray this shirt we're going to treat this shirt with spray bright this is a 100 cotton gilded shirt and then i'm going to switch it out for this shirt that i sprayed last night so that we're not waiting for it to dry so the first thing you want to do my press by the way is at 400 degrees for 60 seconds the first thing you want to do is lint roll your shirt there's been times where i've looked at my shirt and it doesn't look like it needs to be lint rolled so i skip that process and once i've sprayed the shirt and everything's locked in i see fuzzy fuzzy fuzzies so i always lint roll regardless if i think it needs it or not okay after i lent roll i'm gonna make sure that my sprayer is on a good even mist and mine is actually acting funny so i will be right back okay so i've actually been using that sprayer for a couple of months and it is clogged up i just used it last night and i forgot to rinse it out it can be unclogged i just didn't want to take the time to do it so i switched out for a new sprayer so the first thing we're going to do is spray an even coat of spray bright where the design is going to go um some people like to print out a copy of the design or you know measure to find out more closely of where it's going to go i just kind of eyeball it and this sounds like a lot of phrase but i have mine set on a pretty fine mist so we just want to make sure it's good and even and if you have a roller then you would take your roller and just roll a couple of times along the spray braid now you really do have to find a good healthy medium when spraying because if you spray too much your shirt is going to be very very stiff and you're going to have a ring like right now you can see where it's wet but if you spray this will dry and you won't be able to see that if you spray too much then you're going to be able to see that ring regardless and it's not going to wash out there is nothing you can do to make that ring come out i have peroxided and kind of rub with my finger and try to work work it out sometimes that does help but it's best to just try to find that healthy medium so that it's not getting too stiff and leaving the ring so i'm going to show you oh and if you don't spray enough then it's not going to hold to your shirt very well and your design is not going to be as bright and it's going to wash out so you really have to make sure you're finding that good healthy medium and you have to make sure the entire area is covered because if you left a hole that's not covered that part of your design will wash out so i just showed you how to roll it on with a roller i am going to show you if you don't have a roller once you spray it you fold the shirt in half onto itself and then you rub your shirt your hand on the back of it and that's to rub the fibers to rub the spray right into the fibers so that it bonds very well and is holding on to the cotton fibers making them act as if they are polyester fibers i see a spot here i'm gonna reapply to it was i'm not sure if my design will go this far or not but it's better to be safe all righty and so after you spray it you can leave it under the press it takes about five minutes to dry under the press or you can let it hang dry if you're doing multiple shirts a lot of the times i'm doing 100 shirts at a time and so what i do is i will lay them all out along my work desk spray them you know treat them and then hang them up to dry and i just kind of get an assembly line going so if you're just doing a couple of shirts and you want it to dry fast you can leave it under the press you can pull the press down just a little do not or i would suggest not closing your plate down onto the wet fabric just hold it above and i think it takes about three minutes to dry that way but i'm going to set this shirt aside because i have a shirt that is also 100 cotton that i sprayed this exact same way last night and it dried overnight all right so i can feel that this is a little stiff being stiff is completely normal the stiffness will wash out after a few washes i have never had a customer complain about their shirt being stiff i'm not saying that your customers won't complain i know everybody is different everybody has different preferences um but i have sold thousands and thousands of shirts and i have never had a customer message me and say hey my shirt's really stiff so i don't think that it's that big of a deal and i understand to some people they may not like it that's just the nature of the beast i guess so this shirt is completely dry we are going to go ahead and sublimate a design on this shirt and again this is 100 cotton now whenever you're sublimating if you were to sublimate on a 100 cotton shirt some of your transfer will it will transfer i'll show you a couple of shirts that i have done with no spray at all and with spray the spray will transfer but it will be dull and it will wash out very quickly when using the spray bright what you're doing is you're bonding these fibers to the shirt you're bonding the spray brite to the fibers in the shirt and this is giving the ink a surface to hold on to a polyester like surface to really lock into and i have shirts that i have been wearing and washing for a year a little over a year because i've been using spray bright a little over a year so i have shirts that i've been wearing and washing for a little over a year some of them weren't applied correctly so they have more fading and some of them that i applied you know once i got my my pattern down the ones that were applied correctly are still going strong after me wearing them regularly and washing them regularly for over a year so the spray brite really does help this was 400 degrees for 60 seconds and we just peel this off and there we have our design on 100 cotton so before i uh lift it up i can see there is some yellowing around the surface and this is scorching this is where the fibers or the spray kind of burn a little bit on the heat press so i have here hydrogen peroxide mixed with water i fill about this is an eight ounce bottle i put about three ounces of hydrogen peroxide and then fill the rest up with water and just do a light mist where i see the yellow and then allow that to dry most of the time just spraying it the one time will work the scorching out once and sometimes i do have to spray it two and even three times but the hydrogen peroxide has always gotten the scorch out for me and i have noticed um you can go over with your roller too if you want to kind of push it into the fibers but i have noticed that on my bleach shirts the scorching is much more significant and i'm assuming that's the bleach plus the spray brite all just burning so i do have to be a little more diligent with the hydrogen peroxide on my bleach shirts i don't get a whole lot of scorching from from the 100 cotton and on the white but i don't do a lot of these shirts to be honest my my specialty is the bleach sublimation so this is our design on 100 cotton bright vibrant and i am going to grab a couple that i did yesterday to show you the difference okay so we have here a 100 cotton shirt that has been treated with spray brite these have not been washed yet and we have a 100 cotton shirt that was not treated with spray bright as you can see the design did transfer there's there's a big difference but the design did transfer but where you will see a big difference is when we wash this um i'm gonna grab one that i have already washed we have okay this shirt here i did a 50 50 coverage so i folded it in half and sprayed this side and did not spray this side and this is after uh i guess about four washes you can see that this design is still bright and vibrant on 100 cotton and this design is almost gone and it will be gone after a few more washes so that is really the difference that spray bright makes this one is i've had a lot of people asking about our glitter spray bright we do offer glitter spray bright and i don't know if you can see the sparkle in the camera but this was sprayed with on 100 cotton with our glitter spray bright and this glitter will stay in the design for as long as the design is on the shirt which will be a very long time this has been washed about four to five times and it is still very bright and vibrant on 100 cotton okay now i'm going to show you a couple of bleached tees and these are gildan soft style 65 polyester 35 cotton and i get a lot of people asking do i really need to use spray bright if it is on 65 polyester okay no you really don't need to this is a 65 polyester no spray bright just bleach and sublimated okay it's pretty it's great i would i would sell this but this shirt with the exact same shirt exact same bleaching method exact same materials used same design but this shirt was treated with spray brite and here is your design here so let's just get a comparison so no you don't have to use spray bright when it comes to the 65 polyester but it definitely makes a difference and it's definitely my preference i always use spray brite well guys i think that's all i have for you today if you have any questions feel free to reach out um thank you for being patient with me as this is my first video i've never done anything like this before and again if you have any questions please feel free to reach out i hope that i made this clear we are working on new ways to apply the spray bright more convenient ways to apply the spray brite um we haven't really released that yet so i'm going to wait and do a video on that later we are also working on a concentrate to be able to sell you a larger amount that one you will need to mix with water but we will still offer our original that you don't have to do any mixing and it's ready to go so the concentrate is just for customers who want to buy in larger amounts but it's not really cost effective to ship those larger amounts for the customer or for myself so we're gonna do a concentrate for those also definitely look into this glitter spray right it is a game changer it's been a big hit customers love it my spray brite customers love it my kids love it definitely try it out um again if you have any questions please feel free to reach out thank you so much for being patient with me and i hope you guys have a good day", "ERgE8QFfGnQ": "all right y'all so as promised i am sorry i got to turn my tv down okay so as promised i'm going to show you all a new solution on how to do sublimation on cotton um textiles okay so you're gonna need a spray bottle and you're going to need eight ounces of water in here and then you're gonna need this minwax polycrylic okay i got the clear gloss finish i don't know if the finish matters this is what i happen to get so hopefully it works okay um this is my first time doing it i saw jlo's creations on youtube i'll link her video this is originally how i uh saw this idea she's the first person who i've seen to do it this way and i'm gonna try it so i'll be sure to link her videos so you guys can check her out if you want to see how she did it so at any rate eight ounces of water two tablespoons of this poly acrylic all right so the price for this was 22 this was 17 and some change and then this was three dollars and some change so 22 dollars and look how much you're getting okay two tablespoons is nothing out of this i mean i can use this probably forever and when i bought this these are four ounces so i got two four ounce bottles off of etsy and so again you know you be the judge and i think i paid around it's on sale now because i just look but i paid around 20 some odd dollars for this so price wise they were about the same but what you get and obviously how they work are going to be totally different so um yeah let's go ahead and make the solution all right so we got a really good shake and obviously if you want to make more make more you can fill this thing all the way up just for every eight ounces of water do two tablespoons of polycrylic okay and i'm gonna get our shirt over here i've been waiting wanting to do this project on these two little shirts i got from um hobby lobby they were on clearance so i've been waiting to use them for something so this will be perfect i'm going to do like um a little theme or something on them [Music] i want to spray honey but is it open oh my god wasn't over and pretty much you want to [Music] like really get this thing wet um i don't like the spray bottle i'm gonna be honest with y'all cause it doesn't have the oopsies and i broke it broke this try to get you a nozzle that actually is a sprayer not one that just has this single spray like get one that sprays like evenly because i don't like this um all righty so what i'm going to do is sit this under the um heat press not actually put the plate down but just sit it on the um heat press is our is heat oh it's not even heating up it's already at 400 degrees so i'm just gonna kind of let this i guess dry by that heat while i do the other one and um the tutorial that i saw she actually put her stuff in she let it air dry she let one air dry and she let one dry in the dryer i'm gonna heat press these to dry them but first um like i said i'm gonna sit this underneath the heat press just kind of let it chill there until i'm done with the other one okay probably should use gloves too sorry you should probably use gloves all right and out of that solution we started out with eight ounces i'm probably at like the five ounce line all right so this two will go under the heat press and see you guys over there [Music] [Applause] [Music] so this looks like it may take longer than i was expecting so i am going to throw this stuff in the dryer y'all just to speed up the process because i have a few other things to get to today so we're going to put this in a dryer all right you guys so basically here we have it okay this is our um our prints i got both of these off of etsy i don't know for some reason the quality on this one doesn't seem as nice as this one and i did not distort it a lot but um that's what i have these were in a dryer they do have a little bit of stiffness about them from going in the dryer i'm not sure why that is but they do have a little bit of stiffness to them all right so it's hot i know [Music] okay so see that right there the black hair didn't go didn't get absorbed all the way another thing is that i think i was way too high 400 degrees is way too high for this considering i put a chemical solution on here so look at that see how it's yellowing around there which i know there's ways to fix that um i don't really care to fix it oh that's hot and here's our little boss man so how do i like this they're okay there is some yellowing and y'all i honestly is getting late because this kind of was a long process does it work absolutely does work um oh that's hot but that looked a lot better this looks a lot better than the shirt i did yesterday for corey and this is pink and that was a gray shirt so there's no way that this light pink should be popping to me any more than a gray shirt um i obviously didn't put enough solution there so it's important to saturate well because the black hair didn't really take but you guys it does work and it can be done this black is a little iffy too but overall y'all it does look good i'm actually going to wash them i'm going to wash them and see if this residue comes off and so we can get a test on how they look after they've been washed so i'm gonna do that too so anyway y'all don't forget to like comment subscribe let me know um what you guys think about this do you all think that it's worth you know doing your own poly um poly tea spray or not even poly tea spray but doing your own sublimation spray and doing these shirts definitely will play around with the heat settings i most certainly will be doing this again and i think i'm going to lower my temperature to 350 and i'm going to do it in 60 second increments and then going from there i think 400 is too high especially considering we sprayed a chemical on there that's the first mistake so we'll definitely redo it so anyway all right y'all bye hey guys so i am back and here are the shirts with after they've been washed and i don't know if you all recall this one the pigment wasn't that great to begin with and it's definitely horrible now and i think that the color even bled not think it did the color bled after washing and it set for a few days and you guys can see the splotches where the color wasn't even to begin with with this one and of course it did fade um the image is still there i don't know what's so different about this then have we not treated it versus have we um versus how we did treat it like if using cotton so i don't know how helpful this is to you all but this is the after the wash i will insert a picture of the befores and do i feel that it's worth it no not really could it also be user error most certainly you guys know that that was my first time doing it i can definitely try it again and see how it turns out oh and then for corey's y'all his was even worse i used the um poly t sublimation spray for his did i look at that his face is completely gone you do see the tick tock name but look at that this is completely gone and that's using the [Music] subletty spray from etsy so yeah that's this time i can try it again i may try it again guys using something smaller see if i can get better results and i'll follow instructions by the t for the subletting because i didn't lose it but i did take a screenshot so hopefully possibly i can redo it and follow the directions to the t for the poly t and then for the acrylic for the poly acrylic and water i don't know i can try it again y'all and see what else we can come up with but this was the wash test and they do not pass in my book so yeah um if y'all have any suggestions comments leave them down below and let's talk about it bye y'all", "2jwkXLlyJvQ": "[Music] please like comment share and subscribe [Music] hey now it's your girl shanita nicole and welcome to do dream one if you're new and if you are already a dreamer welcome back welcome back welcome back okay y'all i'm geek today i'm excited today i am going to be using this poly acrylic i'm going to be using this some good old h2o and i'm going to be sublimating on a hundred percent cotton shirt so i'm gonna do two i'm gonna do gold because i'm feeling bold and i'm gonna do white you see this white so these are just your classic gildings i don't know about this when it's a heavy cotton these are classic guildens 100 gildan excuse me 100 cotton shirts both of them are 100 percent content now both 100 content and we're just gonna see and what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna show you the image that i'm gonna use but i'm excited so what we're gonna do is we're going to use um this is spray bottle i got from the dollar store gonna use eight ounces of water and we're gonna use two tablespoons of this poly acrylic okay so the finish i'm doing is clear satin they have matte they have a bunch of different ones but this is the one i'm using so we gonna see how this one go okay okay so this is the image that i'm going to be using and now i just want to see how i want it on the shirt um the shirt is gonna be a medium shirt i typically really wear i could wear a medium large or extra large depending on how i want the shirt to fit i just grabbed a medium that was the first one i chose so i'm trying to figure out i think i'm going to duplicate it just in case i mess up i'll have the original copy right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to stretch it out a little bit i'ma see if i could do it because i like the page flip this way but i'm gonna see if i could stretch the image out a little bit just so i can wear it the way i want okay so right now we're just playing with the size so that's something you always want to be sure of when you're creating things how it's going to look on the shirt so remember the area that i spray you want to make sure you can actually see the image right so i'm letting it air dry then i'm probably going to just blow dry it to make sure it's all the way dry and soft and not like hard because if it air dry it'll probably be hard so i could throw it in dryer or blow dry it whatever i'll probably just blow dry because i don't feel like going down there so i mean i'm just keeping it real y'all know that's what i do so i'll make sure that i have enough of the image um so it can be this way yes i'm just doing like this now a few things this neon which i'll talk about later when i print it out it's not going to be neon because i don't have neon ink sublimation ink they do have it i just don't have any so it's going to that green is not it's probably gonna come out looking like this down here green okay so i do know that so i want the colors to pop but i know neon won't show because i don't have the colors to mix to make that so it'll be a different variation of it so i'm going to go ahead and send this to my epson workforce 7720 um and i'm going to do two of them because remember i'm doing it um i'm a print twice because i'm doing it on my um the gold shirt too just because i got to be fancy i don't know i just said i wanted to try it just to see how it would stick on that one too so we are going to y'all know i have presets already my popping colors i'm doing this in cassette 2 because that's where my larger paper is i'm printing two copies and yeah so that's the image we're gonna print it out i'm gonna come back once it's printed out and dry and we gonna get this thing popping ten all right stay tuned okay so what i'm going to do is i'm going to put one tablespoon in first then i'm going to put the eight ounces of water then i'm going to put the second tablespoon okay then i'm going to close it up and ignore that that's just my makeup and then i'm going to make sure it's closed and i'm going to shake it up shake it up shake it up shake it and that's literally all you have to do make sure this is closed clean everything up shake it up a little bit and that's that ready to go okay y'all so guess what i have put my um shirt up under the heater sounds like maybe while i'm recording the um other portion that it'll help dry a little bit it completely dry so if this will completely dry now i will say it's not soft like if i put in a dryer like i literally can feel where the poly is which actually is a good thing because now i know where i can lay my image so my first picture came out this is the asap paper today this is what we'll be using is asap today and this is the image it came out so good look at that that looks amazing right so and actually that neon remember i said it was ago it looked a little bit yeah so show me so anywho this image came out looking so good this is uh so i'm going to um dry the yellow shirt but we might as well go ahead and do this so let's do this one first so i'm about to go ahead and do it it's on 400 degrees 60 seconds if you missed it you can rewind it but i have poly acrylic i put two tablespoons um and eight ounces of water here i was safe i had my gloves so the shirt is dry it's completely completely dry this is that can you hear this so you can hear it so it's completely dry i'm going to go ahead and um uh put it under heat press for a couple seconds i'm so excited y'all then i'm gonna do it and see how it turned out then we still gonna do the gold one but we gonna do this one since we're here so let me go ahead and set this up and move in move you guys in closer all right y'all let's see how this turned out this is my first oh snaps oh my goodness oh my goodness now i just threw it on there y'all saw that look oh yo i'm so good look at that and this is 100 cotton shut the noise oh my god are so good oh mine turned out so good look at this y'all stop playing with me shut up this this image i just found on google too i literally just found this on google okay so let's rewind what i did yo i'm tsugi okay let's rewind [Music] poly acrylic mine was clean satin i got this from lowe's eight ounces of water two tablespoons of poly acrylic and then i put this under the heat press so i actually laid it up under the heat press while i was doing the other portion i think it was like maybe six minutes not even 10 i don't think it dried it completely and then y'all i'm sorry i have my sucker y'all know i always be whatever and then look at this so i'm gonna do a wash test i'm not gonna do it today but i'm gonna do a wash test so we can see what happens but we gonna do that gold but baby we gotta just let's take a minute to just admire this real quick i might put this on today so it was a success if you want to do this for just like a day for an event let's say you're doing a walk let's say you have something you want to use um as far as being toxic i did hear that because it's only two tablespoons and diluted in eight ounces of water and then we shake it up it's not a whole lot of the poly acrylic that's in here it's diluted with eight ounces of water right so it's two tablespoons eight ounces of water we shake it up so it's not like it's really harsh or toxic um do this on your own wrist i don't have anything you know i'm not a dermatologist or a doctor or anything like that so i'm not saying that you would do it i feel comfortable enough to do it for myself so you don't try this at home that's my disclaimer but for me because i didn't use that much i would feel comfortable putting it on myself even if i just had a undershirt or something on under here to make myself feel better but yeah so we gonna try this gold out so i'll be back oh why the gold is getting dry real quick guess what it's not hard no more so it feel it make a little bit it's not hard like how it was i don't know if the heat did something to it but it feels feels good it's not like crisp or crunchy or anything like that y'all okay we're gonna let that finish dry i'll be back all right i'm back yes i'm getting yes i did put it on excuse i got some makeup on there so excuse that that's just the makeup but 100 cotton size medium image from google shout out to whoever was the artist makeup by me messing up my list whatever so now we're just going to see this this might be a fail let's just prepare ourselves this one might not work but it's okay because this one did okay so we're just gonna see all right and you do want to put um butcher paper in the middle of it i ain't doing it for right for right now because i'm just not but you do want to put so anytime you sublimate you want to put butcher paper in between the images on top of it to protect everything this just for the for myself my i'm not doing it right now um i just ordered some more butcher paper actually from amazon and it just came in the mail today so we're preserving the butcher paper this is gonna be mine too so that's not 100 perfect it's fine does this just flow on me okay so recap while we wait for these 60 seconds um two tablespoons of poly acrylic two tablespoons poly acrylic mine was um clear satin i don't know if that matters or not that's what mine was eight ounces of water our gloves to be safe shake it up shake it up shake it up shake it spray it dry it i put that under the heat press it dry it dried the whole thing in less than 10 minutes but you can put it in your dryer you can use a blow dryer you could um use a fan hey whatever you air dry it whatever works for you i put it under my heat press though and um cosmos ink guild and shirts 100 cotton yeah i'm so excited y'all i'm like literally hyped over this that was 60 seconds let's see you see that's why i use that butcher paper you see that that's why you use the butcher paper okay and like i thought the gold shirt is different it went but the colors because it's gold it did it the black work but because all those other colors on the go it didn't it didn't go but now you know so people i can't do it on dark because i went in my group real quick i went live in my group request while i was waiting and um can you do it on dark so i'll tell them how it turned out for darker but y'all know what it is and that's but y'all know what it is and that's a wrap thank you so much for your time please like

target my target was very picked over last time i went there but i did find some graphic tees that i love and i want to show them to you so let's go ahead and jump into the video [Music] first up is this pink floyd t-shirt i really like this one it is 60 cotton 40 polyester it's a really soft material now the color is really like a dark dark blue almost like a dark dark navy but blue black kind of color it's really flattering i really liked the color and a lot of you guys really liked this shirt on instagram so i already have this linked on my like to know i will link all the t-shirts here that i'm showing you but i wanted to go ahead and show you how i actually would style this if i just wanted it a little bit more than just a t-shirt and jeans so i just picked out my flannel shirt and on cold summer nights i i have cold summer nights or chili at least i would wear this and then during the day i would just wear the flannel around my waist i've seen a lot of people do this this is really a popular look and i also have it on with chucks so i really like this look like this another look that i like would be great for like a ballpark kind of night would be just a hat jeans and the checks again now moving on to the next shirt this is the rolling stones t-shirt that you've seen on instagram a lot it's 100 cotton and they've had this at target for a while so i don't know how long that they'll keep this in stock but right now they do have these at target and online so this is like a really good t-shirt material it's 100 cotton so it's gonna get softer in the wash the more you wash it and it's going to get that faded look and i really like that about my t-shirts now here is a different way to style this other than just jean shorts just throw on a skirt and if you're going out and about you could just put on some some chucks but if you wanted it a little bit more fancier you could also dress it up which i'm about to show you here so i threw on my open toe booties i did find a similar pair to these but these are like two years from target and i also have this leather jacket or a faux leather jacket that i got from target last year and i have a similar link for that as well moving on to this palm trees tank top i really like how high this is this would be this would be a really good swimsuit cover up but it would also be a really good piece to wear to the gym actually all these t-shirts would be really good to wear to the gym but it's got a nice length i like the cut on the sides like that v cut i find that really really flattering on a lot of women and you could tuck it in you could untuck it but you could also wear it with your mom jeans now you guys loved these mom jeans you guys loved these and i love them too as well but i have these on with some fake birkenstocks i actually recommend going on poshmark to find birkenstocks because they will be cheaper now moving on to the next one this is the sublime t-shirt this is 50 cotton 50 polyester now i really like this shirt but my son was like that is really scary but anyways i have it paired with my lululemon um pants that are really really comfortable to hold you in they are really great for working out because they are very squat proof i have also my black adidas on i could not find a link for these but you could probably find them on poshmark and another way you could wear them is with some black denim shorts and i have my cheetah shoes on these are still in stock and they also have girls sizes as well now moving on to the beach boys t-shirt i really really love this t-shirt because it has the frayed look at the collar and it was really comfortable i really loved this shirt and if i hadn't kept a different shirt you'll have to watch my instagram to see which shirt i kept then i would have kept this one and this one is 100 cotton so it will get softer and more worn in the more you wash and dry it and but just be sure when you're you're dry for the first time don't dry it on high heat because it will shrink now i have this paired with those same black denim shorts and a hat and some chucks so i really like this look it's like kind of like a beachy california look to me i don't i don't know if you guys see that or not but yeah it's one of my favorite looks i love those black denim shorts and then on the cool summer nights you could throw on a denim jacket and you're set i wanted to also show you guys my jewelry collection here these are from the same person my friend june she's a mother of four and somehow in her spare time even though she doesn't have that much spare time she makes these earrings and a part of her proceeds goes to help women in need i love these and these you know i just love all of them and she has so many different styles textures cuts i mean these are knots these have little gold on them and yeah all kinds of things that she likes to um all the time all kinds of textures and colors and stuff this is what i'm trying to get to um but i will leave her instagram here and you can contact her and see what types of earrings she has at the moment let's see i think these three are new to me so she might still have those but i'm not sure about the other ones she might have one or two left but for the most part i think she has these right now okay guys that's it for this video i hope you enjoyed it please give it a like and subscribe and hit that bell notification if you want to be notified every time i upload a video hopefully fingers crossed i can get some more videos uploaded soon i just ordered some amazon stuff

next time bye you", "pgBfew1-YqY": "hey everyone i hope you're doing well just wanna do a very quick video showcasing some really nice technical and basic tees from uniqlo i have a handful of uniqlo tees that i've been wearing for more than a year and they've held up really great this particular shirt it's the alexander wang aries mt collab that they did a while back and it's held up absolutely great so i did notice that uniqlo added some more colors and a couple different cuts of the arizona tea to the website so i thought i would go ahead and pick some up just because there's such a good basics and i also picked up two supima cotton tees from there because i wanted to try those out and then each t-shirt i'm going to show you guys i'm going to give a sizing reference for them because it's a different cut or it might be a different size or anything like the supima cotton teeth i got one in a large one in medium and then i would showcase the different styles of other t-shirts as well i'm gonna go ahead and talk about what makes arizona so special so if you want to skip that skip to this time right here to go ahead and get to the t-shirts and if you want to see how i style it with some very simple fits go ahead and skip to this time right here by the way if you guys are into fashion at all i highly recommend you pick up a tape measure it just makes buying clothes online so much easier it just makes buying clothes online a little bit more worry free because you can measure the clothes based on the size charge to something else you already have in your collection just for a sizing reference i also sell stuff on grailed and this comes in really handy just to give a potential customer an idea of the size of the garment i'll go ahead and link a super cheap version of this down in the description below highly recommend it so four out of the six shirts i'm going to be showing you today are the airism fabric which does have a lot of cool technical features in it such as it's anti-wrinkle especially after washing it's antibacterial just to help stop odors it's cool to the touch and of course it's quick drying and very breathable as well really interesting feature that they have with some of the uniqlo errorism tees are that they are uv protectant so i wanted to look into that a little bit more to see like kind of what that was and i couldn't find anything super concrete on what they do to errorism to make it more uv protectant than a normal piece of clothing but i did find some general information on the internet regarding uv protective clothing and then taking the knowledge from there and then comparing it to what uniqlo does release you can kind of theorize on what they do so basically darker colors protect you a little bit better than lighter colors the denser the weave of the fabric obviously the more protection you're going to get from the sun which is pretty intuitive you know if you have a fabric that's super tight it's not going to let as much sun get through treatment and dyes can be added to a fabric to either reflect or absorb uv rays i suspect this is what uniqlo does with their arrows and tees because aerism is a very breathable fabric so it does let air through so it's not super dense they do say on the tag of some of the errors and tees that uv filtration has been added to the fabric to a rating of upf 40 plus which i looked it up and that rating means it blocks 97.5 or greater of the uv rays shiny polyesters and satin silk type fabrics do a really good job of reflecting uv rays as well which i think this plays into airism because depending on the t-shirt it's either 27 to 47 polyester however these heirism shirts don't really have like any shine to it like with a lot of athletic tees so they're all really subtle and look nice for just everyday wear anyways enough of that i'm gonna go ahead and get into the t-shirts so the first one i got this is the uniqlo u arizum oversized boxy tee and this one is definitely the most unique cut of all of these shirts i was going to get this back when the uniclo u collection initially released but upon the day of release there must have been some logistical error because it wasn't available until like a week or two later so then i just kind of missed out on it but luckily they are still in stock the thing i like most about this tee are the elongated sleeves they come about right up to the elbow and it does have the dropped shoulders and a much tighter collar than a standard t i mean it's not like too tight where it's uncomfortable but it is a little bit more snug up so it does have a very unique silhouette i think this looks really good with like some techier fits maybe some pairs of pants that are a little bit wider or a little bit baggier just to kind of match the oversized proportion of the top this does come in a lot of different colors but i opted just for black just because it is more of a unique cut of tea so i just wanted to play it safe and go with a subtle black instead of a really bright color but again that's just my subjective style opinion because this is oversized i did size down to a size medium now just looking at the size of this tee here the rough measurement shoulder to shoulder which i measured from the hem to the hem it's 52 centimeters or like 21.5 inches and then the total length from top to bottom is about 70 centimeters or like was that like 27.5 inches i think and then the shoulder to the end of the sleeve is 26 centimeters or like that's like 10 and a half inches i think so it's definitely pretty boxy um however the the shoulders are like i said earlier the drop shoulder so they are supposed to go off your shoulder so that's why it's so wide in those measurements but again that's a size medium for wrestling i did pick up one of the basic airism cotton crewneck short sleeve t-shirts and this is just a normal cut t-shirt that i picked up in this really nice dark gray and this dark gray in the arizona fabric kind of gives off a really cool kind of industrial metallic metal like vibe to it that's kind of weird to say but i don't know it has a more athletic cut to it but it's not too slim and they do have normal length sleeves but a lot of times with my t-shirts i do like to cuff it two times just to make my t-shirts fit a little bit better or maybe subconsciously i'm trying to make my noodle arms a little bit more buff looking i don't know i did get this in a size large and the rough measurements of this are shoulder to shoulder it's 47 centimeters or like 18.5 inches total length from top to bottom is 71 centimeters or like 28 inches so again a little bit longer than the boxier cut one and then the sleeve length unrolled of course it's about 22 centimeters which is like nine inches right right now it's just kind of wrinkled because it came packaged up all folded up really close so i'm trying to get that out of here so the next two shirts are of the same cut these are the arizon uv protectant long sleeve and these are an online exclusive so i got one in black just to play it safe can't go wrong with a very basic black tee and i also got this one in dark gray which it almost kind of has like a brown hue to it depending on the lighting in this camera it does look pretty gray um but in some lighting it does kind of give off some brown undertones which i think is really cool and i think this one might be my favorite tee of this whole like mini haul but it has a really nice earthy tone to it it's very classic fit but it's not too boxy being a basic long sleeve there's not too many cool features with this but there are like a small slit on the sides of the waist and then of course you have a nice cuff and collar as well i did get both of these in a size large and the rough measurements from shoulder to shoulder are is 47 centimeters which is like 18.5 inches the total length is 72 inches or 28 inches just like the last tee and then the sleeves are 58 centimeters which is about 23 inches these errors and teeth just have like such a great feel they feel so comfortable and i really really like the texture of it as well it's not too shiny and soft kind of like more typical workout gear but it still remains to be very soft and kind of a soft like cool touch to it but anyways lastly i did pick up two supima cotton basic tees and i am quite impressed with the feel and quality of these t-shirts now just comparing the supima cotton to a standard cotton tee from uniqlo is the supima cotton tee is noticeably more soft and it almost feels like errorism it's so smooth whereas the other one it's a little bit more coarse and granded this one is older but if you're thinking about getting one of the t-shirts i would just go ahead and opt and pay more for the nicer quality tea so anyways i did get these in two different color ways i did get one in a dark green and then the other in a dark brown now the dark green is a size large and the brown is a size medium this season they did design these to be a little bit of a looser fit just so it drapes more on the body both the green and the brown do have undertones of gray in it which makes it very very wearable just for every day and then being 100 con these are much more of a matte color than the arizontes not that the arrows and tees are shiny at all these are just noticeably more of a matte color so the large measurements are roughly 44 centimeters from shoulder to shoulder or that's like 17 and a half inches total length is 71 centimeters or like 28 inches and the sleeves are 22 centimeters long which is like eight and a half inches now comparing that with the size medium tee the shoulder to shoulder width is 47 centimeters or 17 inches so you lose about a half inch in width so the total length is 68 centimeters or 27 inches so it's an inch shorter than the large roughly speaking and then the sleeves are 20 centimeters so it's straight eight inches so not too much more terribly small than the large but it is noticeable and in hindsight i probably would have got both of these any size large just because i like a little bit more of extra room in my teeth just so it drapes a little bit nicer on the body and it's a little bit more comfortable anyways here are some outfits that i put together with these again very simple because all these tees are really great basic building blocks to construct an outfit off of so i kept everything very simple and with the aries mts i put together very basic like techware fits whereas the supima contest put together very basic street road looks but anyways here they are [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i will go ahead and link all the t-shirts i got down below in the description i do use an affiliate link it doesn't add anything to the price but if you do choose to buy one of these t-shirts i get a very small cut of it so it's a nice way to support the channel if you want to pick one of these up and they do have these in tons of different colors so whatever fits your taste they should have it anyways guys i will see you in video pretty soon thank you for stopping by and thank you for subscribing i really do appreciate every single one we're almost at 13 000 which is really insane for me to think about but anyways i will see your video pretty soon", "CDQJcmIwCmI": "hey guys Melissa Harris shirt space here today I solve the age-old question what is better cotton or polyester so sit back and let's get to it [Music] in short the best answer I can give you is it's what you're using it for so now let's dive into a pro and con list kind of like you did with your ex before you broke up with them cotton first cotton is strong and it's soft and has been used since the dawn of time you think that would make it the best but in fact that's not good but let's dive into some more pros cotton is breathable so if Comfort is your number one choice you've found your best match another thing cotton is cheaper but that's only for now cotton is renewable and biodegradable but here's your first con cotton is a very water intensive crop with that said they also rely heavily on pesticides this would move this into the con list for sure however organic cotton has really started to make a play within the industry in the last few years okay let's next touch on polyester polyester is a petroleum-based synthetic fiber aka it's plastic you think this would be a con however in the last couple of years manufacturers have actually started to use recycled bottles to make polyester tees more pros for polyester include that it's durable meaning it will withstand all of that wear and tear polyester also dries quickly wrinkles less and is stain resistant all major pros now for the ultimate plot twist manufacturers have actually started to combine the two making it the goat of blinkx poly cotton blends don't shrink they hold both their shape and their color for extended periods of time they are affordable and they have the softness you want in your favorite team okay we've made it this far and you think you know what T is gonna work best for you but I'm about to throw you the ultimate curve ball now you have to put decoration on your apparel so let's get into it first we're going to talk about water-based inks water-based inks you have to use 100% cotton this also applies to discharged inks as well next let's touch base on plastisol inks with plastisol inks you can use bulk cotton and polyester however with poly and poly blends you'll want to make sure you touch base with the manufacturer to make sure you're good to go in the ink Department when it comes to embroidery you can use both cotton and polyester however just make sure you have the right thread count to make sure your needle will pass through the thread with ease finally heat transfers for vinyl you can use both cotton and polyester however make sure you have the recommended heat settings from the vinyl manufacturer for sublimation we recommend using a hundred percent polyester after all of that I guess we're gonna have to let the debate continue because as you can see it really depends on what you're using the product for but we want to hear what works best for you guys and what is your tried-and-true so give us some comments below to let us know what works best for you thank you guys so much for stopping by to engage in the debate of what is better cotton or polyester if you're looking for more debates like this click that subscribe button turn on your notifications and have a great rest of your day oh hey there thought you'd get rid of me but here I am talking again don't worry you'll only have about five more seconds to pick another video before time runs out look at that one in the top I think that one looks very interesting", "I0dYWtua97Y": "Welcome back to the gentleman's Gazette! Today's video is all about cotton. We discuss what it is, what it's not, the\ndifferences in qualities, the impact on the environment, what you should look for when\nyou buy it, and what to watch out for. Cotton, you might wonder, isn't all cotton\nthe same? No, it isn't. Even if it's a hundred percent cotton, there\nare huge differences and today, about 75 percent of men's wear garments have some form of cotton\nin them. It's very affordable, versatile, and accessible,\nand it can hold up to 27 times its own weight in water. It is grown on two and a half percent of the\nworld's arable land and overall, it's a fiber you should know about. So what exactly is cotton? It's basically linked from the cotton plant\nwhich is part of the Gossypium family and the fibers were meant to protect the seeds\nand are comprised entirely out of cellulose material you often find in nature, such as\ntrees. Outer fabrics such as viscose, or bamboo fabrics,\nare all based on cellulose as well. Cotton plants are actually shrubs and they\ngrow wildly but today, they're cultivated most of the time. Looking back, cotton was found in garments\nup until 6000 BC and it was mostly found in the Middle East. Today, the commercially for most grown cottons\nare all derived from that ancient cotton plant. Columbus noticed that when he came to the\nBahamas, it had a huge impact on slavery which was perpetuated by the growth of cotton itself\nand to learn more about it, I urge you to check out our in-depth guide on the website\nhere. Today, most of the cotton comes through US,\nChina, India, as well as many countries in Africa, and South America. In the US, commercial level growth of cotton\nis heavily subsidized while developed nations hugely rely on machines to harvest cotton,\nit is still picked by hand in Africa, or in Egypt, in India, and developing countries. Ofcourse, picking by hand is much more labor-intensive\nand the people who do it or not paid very well. At the same time, you get a pure fiber simply\nbecause you don't get any impurifications into the fiber at the picking stage. When cotton is harvested, they usually select\nthe seeds and so after harvesting in the country of origin, as well as the country where the\ncotton is spun and woven, it goes to many gins that make sure to remove all the seeds,\ndirts, and impurification from the cotton. Because the purer the cotton, the better it\nis. Not all cotton fibers are alike, the better\nones are longer and you can get them in five or six centimeter lengths which is like two\nto two and a half inches. Lower and cotton has shorter staples and it's\nharder to spin them into yarns at the same time, it is usually softer but you will see\npilling much more quickly and it will wear out prematurely. For that reason, all quality cotton products\nrely on long staple cotton. Once the fiber is cleaned, it is spun into\na yarn and sometimes you have a 2 ply yarn which means two strands of yarn apply together\nwhich helps to create a more resilient yarn that is at the same time, more consistent\nand long-lasting. Another process to improve cotton is called\ngassing. It's used to brighten the fiber, smoothen\nit which gives it that typical quality Sheen you may know from higher end cotton shirts,\nespecially in the twill weave. Once the cotton is woven, there's a number\nof different finishing steps that are sometimes proprietary to the manufacturers and it will\nhelp to really get the best out of the cotton fabric. Now that you how it's made, let's talk about\nthe environmental impact. Cotton is very resource-intensive in the growing\nstage, as well as in the manufacturing stage, and it uses a lot of water and the chemicals\nused to process it can be ecologically very damaging. As a crop, cotton likes warm\nclimates and as such, it is oftentimes grown in areas where there's not enough rainfall\nso it heavily relies on irrigation such as in Egypt. To keep pests at bay, you need a lot of chemicals\nbecause of that, genetically modified seeds have been developed that keep pests at bay\nso you don't have to use as many chemicals, but you still need a lot comparatively. Because of rising levels in cotton that gets\nto the end producer, the whole movement of organic cotton was started which is ever-growing. By definition, organic cotton neither has\nchemicals or pesticides and it doesn't rely on genetically modified seeds. Apart from cotton using a lot of water, it\nhas to be linked to desertification in parts of the world as well as solidation of the\nground. The absence of cotton art is an organic material\nthat will decompose unlike things like nylon or polyester. In terms of cotton quality, it all starts\nwith a staple length. Short staple is considered three quarters\nof an inch or about one and a half centimetres. Medium staple cotton is considerably about\nthree quarters of an inch to one and a quarter inch; and a long staple cotton is anything\nfrom one and a quarter inch all the way up to two and a half inches. While the majority of cotton in the world\nis a short staple and then some medium staple, you will only see the staple infused in marketing\nfor higher end cottons. Sometimes when you see labels of higher-end\ncotton, you will see the term sea island cotton but what exactly doesn't mean? It is an extra-long staple cotton grown on\nthe sea islands outside the South Carolina and Georgia. In theory, the sunshine and the level of humidity\nprovide the perfect conditions for a high-quality cotton. Even higher form of cotton is a so-called\nWest Indian Sea Island cotton which is legally only allowed to be grown\nin parts of the Caribbean. Even though the output is limited by the size\nof the island, there are a lot more products labeled as sea island cotton western Sea Island\ncotton that is actually made in any given year. Obviously, there's a lot of fraud going on\nin that part, however, if we can get your hands on genuine West Indian Sea Island cotton,\nit's almost like touching cashmere. Sometimes, shirt makers also advertise Egyptian\ncotton and basically what they mean is it's the longest staple cotton from a batch, it's\nnot necessarily cotton that is always from Egypt. You'll also\nfind Egyptian cotton in towels or anything that touches the skin. Usually, it's used to demand a higher price\nfrom the consumer. A subgroup of Egyptian cotton you see so-called\nGiza cotton which is more high-end. Each giza quality comes with a number. With giza 45 con being the most luxurious\nand high-end Egyptian cotton on the market, its extra-long, has superior fineness, and\nis very consistent. To guarantee the highest quality of the longest\nstaple giza 45 cotton, it is hand picked and hand combed so there are no impurifications\nand you get the finest cotton there is. Sometimes you see pima cotton or american\npima which is named after an American Indian tribe, it is also considered to be a extra\nlong staple con and it came about in the 1900s. You may also have seen supima cotton which\nis short for superior pima cotton and while it's not a grade, it's an organization that\ntries to promote pima cotton. Like organic cotton in itself is not a description\nof quality, all it tells you that no chemicals or pesticides were used and it's not genetically\nmodified. It doesn't tell you anything about the staple\nlength, so if you pay more for organic cotton, you do so because of the impact it has and\nthe pesticide freeness, not in the quality. In my experience, West Indian sea cotton is\nreally the cream of the crop and I would even place it above a giza 45 cotton. For dress shirts, Ialways go for a two ply\ncotton and make sure that it's a hundred percent cotton and it's not stretch with polyester\nor nylon. While it makes it more durable and it's may\nbe appropriate for uniforms, work wear, maybe for chefs in the kitchen, it's not something\nyou want to wear on your skin because it's rougher and not as comfortable, also it's\nnot as absorbent. If you're lucky, you can also sometimes find\npolo shirts made at a pima cotton, however, most of the time, it's a lower grade cotton. Interestingly, thread counts or gsm grams\nper square meter are units used usually for linens and towels, not for garments. In my experience, there's a lot of fraud going\non and I wouldn't rely just on a number that's presented to me. So how can you find out if the cotton is luxurious? The problem is that you have a soft cotton,\nit can feel very comfortable on your skin, but it's in fact soft because the staple is\nso short. Higher-end cotton is usually very fine which\nmeans you can have a very fine weave and you get a very nice Sheen. For men's shirts, probably Albini is a largest\nkid on the block and if you want to learn more about that company check out our guide\non the website here. At the same time there are other good cotton\nmanufacturers out there but sometimes the problem with relying on brands is that they\nmay change the quality over time without you noticing it or without them changing your\nlabel. For example, I own Polo Ralph Lauren sweaters\nfor over ten years and the quality has gone downhill by a lot. The sweaters have gotten softer but it's because\nthey used shorter staple cotton that pills much more easily and looks old and the colors\nlook washed out much more quickly than the older sweaters I have. So what are their cotton buying do's and don'ts? Don't believe that all cotton is created equal. Quality cotton is usually softer, it is shinier,\nit is finer, and it has a smaller impact on the environment because you can wear it for\nlonger periods of time. You should always expect more from a higher\nand cotton retailer; they should be able to tell you what specific kind of cotton is used,\nhow many plys they are, how heavy the fabric is, and where it was sourced. At the same time, don't believe all the labels\nthat are not backed up by a trusted industry Authority such as Albini, Thomas Mason, or\nTessitura Monti, or other famous cotton makers which are known to produce a quality product\nmade out of long staple cotton. So how shouldyou care for cotton? Fortunately, it's one of the more easier items\nto take care of. You can machine wash it, you can hand wash\nit, but machine wash is totally fine, the only time I'd stay away from machine washing\nmy cotton is in a suit such as a seersucker suit or another cotton suit but mainly because\nof the canvas and the things on the inside not necessarily because of the fabric itself. Ideally, you should always follow the care\ninstructions on the label because if you wash it too hot, the color may come out and I also\nwould urge you to wash it with light colors, otherwise, the chances of it looking duller\nis much higher. To keep colors vibrant and cotton in a good\nstage, it's best not to wash the pair of jeans after every single time of wear and if you\ndo, you can pull them inside out just like with the sweaters to try to prevent pilling\non the outside which is visible. Also, it helps your cotton if you don't over\ndry it so ideally, air dry it. If you have to use a dryer, maybe partially\nput it in a dryer and then hang it to be air dried, otherwise, if you fully put in a dryer\nyour garment won't last as long. When it comes to dress shirts, should never\nput them into the dryer because of the interlining that may come lose, it's harder on it so always\nair dry those. You can either iron a dress shirt when it's\nwet so it's relatively easy and the wrinkles come out. The problem is it takes a lot longer and so\nyou have to figure out what makes sense for you. Ideally you put it on a hanger and let it\ndry. When in doubt about the temperature you should\nwash your cotton on, go with a lower temperature or wash it on cold because it will make sure\nthat your colors last longer.

In today's video I'm wearing a rather casual\noutfit made of a polo shirt from Uniqlo out of 100% cotton. the collar is made like a shirt collar and\nit's not so flimsy like usual polo shirt collars because of that I really like it because. I'm wearing it untucked it's not longer in\nthe back than it is in the front and the shorts I'm wearing are by Polo Ralph Lauren made\nout of a soft cotton this is an old pair of shorts that is still made out of a higher\nquality cotton in my opinion than the newer shorts you can buy these days my shoes are\ncasual summer shoes called Alpergatas from Spain they are made out of a checked cotton\nfabric on a u2 soul with rubber it's a very summery shoe and it doesn't give you a lot\nof structure yet it's breathable and I find it perfect for outings at the beach or just\nvery summery resort wear outfits that don't really care about formality.", "SSP44Kl19gk": "it's always a surprise that more brands don't carry a style like this because pocket teas tend to be one of the most requested items the fabric is the same as the Gildan g500 so it's still a fairly boxy promotional fit if you're looking for a smoother cotton and more euro style fit then you may want to take a look at the 9 8 3 by anvil instead alternatively if you like an even heavier cotton gild it also has the G two-30 which has the same fabric as the G 200 ultra cotton tee the stitching on the pocket is done with a single needle instead of a double needle to prevent it from looking bulky and it's situated on the left side of the chest it also features a tearaway label all colors are 100% cotton with the exception of sport and ash grey Heather neon and safety color", "maoUzT6aYqc": "hey everyone I'm Brittany with heat press nation and in this video I'm going to show you how to sublimate a t-shirt [Music] if this is your first time with us on YouTube please subscribe to our Channel and click the notification bells so that you're up to date on new tutorials live episodes and more from heat pressed nation if you're looking for more details on sublimation we have our sublimation starts here playlist which can be watched right now by clicking the card above let's get started one of the top reasons for sublimating onto a t-shirt is that you get a photo quality image with super vibrant colors not only that but since you're dyeing the shirt the transfer doesn't feel like it's there at all also making it very light to wear lastly sublimation is a permanent solution and has fantastic wash ability if you're new to sublimation are doing your research on it here's a quick look at what you'll need to sublimate a t-shirt first is a sublimation printing system which is a specialized printer ink and paper made specially for sublimation if you want more details on these systems check out our category page at heat dot press / sublimation for this video shirt a print out my transfer with a sawgrass printer with sublogic HD ink you'll also need a heat press I'll be working with our 15 by 15 inch craft pro and of course we will need a t-shirt I'll be transferring onto a hundred percent polyester t-shirt because of the nature of the sublimation process you can't use organic materials like cotton the dye simply will not stick to it for the best most clear and vibrant results go with a hundred percent polyester I'm going to print up my design on the Sawgrass printer using the Sawgrass print manager this program optimizes my printers output so my colors will be true once sublimated it also mirrors the image by default and has a lot of other helpful functions as well notice how my printout looks a little dull and washed out this is totally normal since sublimation inks don't reach their full brilliance until heated up so once we sublimate this transfer onto our t-shirt the colors are really gonna pop we recommend using a pressing pillow for sublimation as I'll help prevent press marks from being left on polyester shirts for the sake of demonstration I'll go ahead and press my shirt without one for now we're first going to Center our shirt on the lower platen and pre press for about three seconds pre pressing the shirt helps eliminate any moisture in the shirt and also gives us a smooth flat surface to work with we're going to place our printed sublimation transfer ink side down on our shirt I'm going to eyeball the center for this demo but you can use an alignment tool like a t-square to get more professional results when placing your transfers before pressing be sure to cover your transfer with the piece of parchment paper to protect our heating element from any out gas dye or bleed through if you're using a thinner t-shirt you may need to slip a piece of parchment paper inside the shirt to block any bleed through to the back or onto your pressing pillow next I'll slide the lower platen back in and press my team for 50 seconds at 385 degrees Fahrenheit the sweet spot for sublimating garments is between 385 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and 45 to 60 seconds for this particular graphic on this shirt I found that 385 degrees for 50 seconds works perfectly depending on your heat press t-shirt ink system our local climate you may find the need to use more or less heat and our time we always recommend performing several test presses with different settings to see what works best for you all right so our shirt is done since I didn't fix the transfer in place with any heat tape or adhesive spray I want to avoid shifting the hot transfer on the surface of the shirt if the ink on the transfer paper is still hot it may still release onto my shirt so if it shifts it may leave us the imprint on the shirt this would result in a blurred look that's commonly referred to as ghosting so I'm going to remove the parchment paper carefully and I'll usually give the transfer a few seconds to air cool before I pill it off and again we want to avoid the transfer from shifting so I'll just pull it off quickly like a band-aid pulling up and away from the tee and there you go we have a gorgeous sublimated t-shirt I wish you could reach into your screen and touch this shirt because it's super soft you literally cannot feel a

watching you", "mQWlqt4xOY0": "- Hello, everybody. My name is Jennifer Maker. Today we are learning how\nto make personalize tshirts with our Cricuts and iron vinyl on the Great Maker Show and Tell. (soft music) So one of the reasons that many people buy a Cricut in the\nfirst place is to be able to make awesome personalized\ntshirts like this one. And it's really easy to see why. The Cricut is perfect for tshirt making and it cuts out iron on\nvinyl designs like a champ. A couple of months ago I did a full color print and then cut tutorial for tshirts and it was a big hit. But print and cut can\nbe a little challenging for beginners so I wanted\nto dial things back a bit, and do a very easy tutorial on how to make a tshirt using iron on\nvinyl with a Cricut. So for this project, we're\ngonna be working with iron on vinyl, also known as\nheat transfer vinyl or HTV. And this is a special vinyl that has a heat sensitive adhesive that will stick to fabric and other\nsurfaces when pressed down with a heat source like a\nhousehold iron or an Easy Press. And I will show you how to\ndo both in this tutorial. Now the cool thing about the Cricut is that you can cut out a design or a name or really whatever you\nwant from iron on vinyl using lots of different\ncolors and textures and designs like this foil. And if you do it right,\nyour shirt can be washed up to 50 times before you\nstart to have any issues. And I'm gonna show you\nthe right way to do it in this video so that\nyou get great results on your first try. Now because the thing is there's really a bunch of things that can go wrong when you're making an iron on tshirt. You need to remember to\nmirror it or flip the design. You have to put your\nvinyl on the cutting mat with the right side up. You have to weed the right\npart out of your design, preheat your shirt, set your temperature to the right amount, press it long enough, and remove the carrier\nsheet at the right time. The good news is that I'm\ngoing to be right here with you the whole time, by your side, making sure that you're able to do this right. So let's start with the\nmaterials that you're gonna need and then I'm gonna show you\nhow to prepare a tshirt design for cutting on your Cricut. So here's everything that I'll be using in this tutorial to make a\nsimple, basic iron on tshirt. We're going to use 100% cotton tshirts. I bought these from both\nMichaels and Joann's I believe. They are Gildan brand I will link to those in this tutorial. Now there's some debate as to whether you need to prewash or not. Cricut recommends that you prewash and thus I have prewashed these. Some people feel that it's not necessary, especially because it\ndoesn't look quite as good if you intend to sell them. One thing that is very important, however, is that they are preshrunk,\nwhich this brand is by the way. So it's up to you whether you\nwant to prewash it or not. We're also going to need some vinyl. I'm going to use Cricut\nvinyl for this tutorial and we're going to use\nvirtually every kind of Cricut vinyl that I can find, so that you can see the different styles and how it looks and how it works to actually apply it to the shirt. You also need a way to cut out your vinyl and we're going to use a Cricut. And all you need for\nthat is Cricut Explorer or a Cricut Maker, and the\nregular fine point blade. That's all that's necessary. Also want the standard grip mat, that's the green mat right here. As far as tools go, I'm\ngoing use a weeding tool and a tweezer can come in very helpful from when you're weeding. I also recommend a pair of\nscissors or a craft knife so that you can cut your\nvinyl off of the roll easily. And I like to use a brayer so I can adhere my vinyl down to my mat, so\neverything is nice and smooth. And to apply the vinyl to your shirt, you're going to want to use an Easy Press or a household iron. Or if you have it, a heat press. I don't have a heat press,\nso I won't be showing you that in this video, but I will show you how to use the Easy Press and\na regular iron to iron with. You're also going to need\na surface to iron on, not an ironing board. I'll be using an Easy\nPress mat to do that. All right, so let's head on over to Cricut Design Space so I can show you how to prepare your design. So here we are in Cricut Design Space, and we wanna start by\nclicking on new project. And I recommend that you use templates, which is accessible if you're on the desktop version of\nCricut Design Space. And I think it's just really helpful for determining the size\nif you have a template. So I'm gonna go ahead and use\nthe classic tshirt template. And I'm gonna turn off the\ngrid just so we can see that. So women's short sleeve. Medium tshirt. And we'll even change the\ncolor since we're going, since I'm going to start\nwith a yellow tshirt. But this part doesn't matter. This is just for designing. So here we have a yellow shirt. And we need a design for this. Now there's tons of awesome\ndesigns in Cricut Design Space. Just click on images and\nyou can search through various things, you know. Ask me about my beard. Never stop looking up. These are all awesome designs, very cute. There's the Cricut Cutie. But I've created a\ndesign that I want to use for this project. So I am going to upload that and you're all welcome to\nuse this design free as well. So if you go to my blog\nat jennifermaker.com and you click on libraries here. Now if you don't have a\npassword, you can request one for free here. If you've got your\npassword, go ahead and click enter the library and you'll be prompted to enter the password. Now I have everything organized in here and we're looking for\nthe Craft Heart SVG file. I'm gonna go ahead and download that. And we're gonna open that up. And there we go, we have that right there. Okay. Now we go back to Cricut Design\nSpace and click on upload. Then upload image, and then browse. And we're gonna go find,\ninto our downloads folder, we're gonna go find that craft heart Jennifer Maker directory and\nyou may have to unzip it. And we're gonna go ahead\nand upload the SVG file. And if you're not familiar\nwith how to use SVGs I hae a whole training series on that that will walk you through it step by step at jennifermaker.com/svgs. All right, so I uploaded\nthis and now I'll go ahead and save it to my image library. And then I'm going to select it here. And then click insert images and it's gonna show up on my canvas. And I've already sized this\nto look right on a tshirt. Now you will notice that\nI have the design here, which is a winged heart and\nit says craft in the middle. And then I have this little\nheart down here in the corner. Now this heart is here\nfor testing purposes. If you don't want to\ntest, you can go ahead and hide it over here with\nthe I icon, just like that. But I really like to\ntest before I, you know, make a mistake on a tshirt. I like to make sure that my iron on vinyl works well and I have\nmy settings properly set before I go ahead and put it on a shirt. And I highly recommend you do that too. So if you'd like to test, I\nrecommend that you go ahead and cut out this heart. You're not gonna keep that heart there. What we're going to do\nis move this heart down probably to the corner here like this. But it's not necessary\nto do that right now. You can do that later when\nyou're doing your testing. But this is the design, if\nyou wanna change anything about it you certainly can right now. I have it set to red,\nwhich I'm going to do one of my designs in red. Let me zoom in a little bit\ndown here with the buttons in the lower left corner. Now I wanna note one thing here, which is if for any reason you don't want the name Jennifer Maker\nto show up on your shirt, which is fine, I won't be offended. You can totally do that. If you click on the design and then click on contour over here,\nyou can actually select each one of these little hearts, I'm sorry, each one of\nthese little letters. And you can see them here as well. If you select them, they\nwill actually be removed from the design itself. So we can get rid of all of these letters or anything else in the design\nthat you might not want. Fr example, perhaps you don't\nwant the little shine here. So you could get rid of that as well. Perhaps you don't want it to\nbe outlined like, you know, the wings outlined. So you could actually remove that as well. And it would look like this. Okay, but if you do want\nthose things, which I do, you're gonna want to go\nahead and show everything so that's what I've got there. All right, so everything is here and it's all ready to go. Of course, we can double\ncheck that our design looks the way we want. This design is 7.99, it's\nbasically eight inches wide which I think is a really\ngood size for an adult tshirt. You can make it bigger if you like. You can make it smaller, it's up to you, but I have sizes to look good on a tshirt. But you can use this template to determine what might look good, right? So for example, this, which is we could cut this out on the\nCricut, is probably, no. It's definitely too big. Because remember, people are 3D, right? And this would start\nto wrap around the body if it was this big. So I think that generally\nspeaking eight inches is actually a really\ngood size for our tshirt. So there is our design all ready to go. And it's time to make it. So we click the make\nit button in the upper right hand corner right\nhere, just like this. Now there's something very\nimportant that we must do for iron on vinyl. And we must mirror our images. And this is true for all iron on vinyl that I've ever worked with. You have to, when you\ncut the iron on vinyl, you actually cut it upside down and that means that we need to mirror it, which means to cut it, you know, with the design flipped as\nif we were looking at it in a mirror. It's very easy to do\nin Cricut Design Space. Over here on the left, it says mirror and you just toggle this\nso it becomes green. And it flips around just like this. And I also suggest that\nyou take that extra little heart that you're gonna test with and move it over so there's\njust a little bit more space, so just over here like this. You just click and drag that. And then we click continue. And then you'll want to\nconnect your machine, if you have more than one like I do. And if not, it will show\nup here automatically. I'm gonna connect my Cricut Explorer two, you can of course use a\nMaker for this as well. If you're using a Cricut\nExplorer like I am, I recommend that you\nset your dial to custom. That will allow you to\nfine tune your materials in the Cricut Design Space. I actually always leave my dial on custom. And then we need to choose our materials. So for the very first iron on vinyl shirt that I'll be doing in this video, we're going to use\nCricut everyday iron on. So I'm just going to search for everyday. And there it is, I'm gonna\nselect that and click done. And I like to switch my pressure to more. It's just something\nthat works well for me. So we've got it set to everyday iron on and we have it set to more. Now there's a little note here that says make sure mirror is turned\non and iron on material is placed shiny side down. And I will go over that\nlater in this video, but make sure that this mirror\nover here says mirror on. It's very important. All right, so we're ready to cut this. Let's go ahead and talk\nabout how to determine which side of the iron on vinyl to cut. All right, so it's time to\ncut out our iron on vinyl. We're gonna use a standard grip mat. And for our first tshirt, we're going use Cricut\nEveryday Iron On Vinyl. Which I've already opened so that makes it a little bit easier. I could just slide that right off. Now my design is, we'll use the full length\nand it's four inches. And you can always check\nthat in Cricut Design Space if you don't recall how\nmuch vinyl to cut off. You can just use scissors\nor you can use a craft knife to just cut it off, which\nI will do right now. And it's approximately\nfour inches, right there. You can of course be\nmore exact if your like. Go. Tape that back up and\ndon't forget to put your, you can either put back on and tape it or slide it in the\nbottom so that you don't forget what kind of vinyl you used. All right, so now the\nslightly tricky part, which is which side of\nthe vinyl to put down. I've created an entire\nvideo to help you identify which is the side to cut on your vinyl. The easy rule to remember\nis shiny side down. Okay, so we're gonna go ahead\nand put shiny side down. There are some exceptions,\nand that happens when it's shiny on both sides and\nit's hard to tell which side. And my video explains exactly what to do, oops, that's not in the right spot. My video shows you exactly what to do and how to determine the right side to cut your iron on vinyl every\ntime so that you don't waste any materials. I like to use my brayer to make sure that the vinly's really\nwell adhered to the mat. So there's no wrinkles. You don't want any\nwrinkles when you cut this. All right, there we go, that's all set. Now our next step is to cut this out. So we've already prepared\nit in Design Space and sent it to our Cricut. So we're gonna go ahead and cut it out. Now you wanna make sure that\nyou have your fine point blade in and that everything\nis all good to go. And you wanna watch for\nthe flashing Cricut button. And when that's ready to go, you go ahead and you press the button\nand it starts to cut. All right, there we go. And once it's cut, we unload our machine with the unload button. And we have our material all cut out. I don't know that you can see that, but it's definitely cut out. And that looks excellent. So we peel it off our mat. Sometimes it's easier to place it face down on your mat like that. I like to tuck my mats under my machine so they're out of the way, just like that. All right, and then we\nare left with our design. Which we can see here. This is going to be the top of it and this is covered\nwith the carrier sheet. It's stuck to it already,\nso you don't need to have any kind of transfer tape or anything. It's actually pretty awesome in that way. But what we do need to do\nnow is weed our project. So weeding means to\nremove all of the vinyl that we don't want\ntransferred to our project when we iron it on or use a heat press. So that means we remove\nall the extra little bits. And you're gonna want a\nweeding tool for this, and I also use my craft knife because I like to get it started. I find it very difficult to just sort of peel it away from the edge. It never really wants to\ncome free very easily. So what I do is make a\nsmall knick in the corner. You don't wanna cut all the way through. Just cut through the iron on vinyl. And I'm on the matte side,\nthe cut side right now. And then it's easier to peel off once you've made that cut, I find. So I have just knicked\nthe corner right here. And now I can get my fingernail under the edge of the vinyl easier because of that little knick. If you have any problems,\nyou can use your weeding tool to kind of pull it away like this. There we go. And once you have it started, you just continue to pull it\naway from the carrier sheet. And your design will\nstay on the carrier sheet and the part that you do\nnot want will pull away, just like this. There we go. Now if you look at it,\nyou'll see that there are, not all of it has been removed, right? So we've got the parts inside\nthe heart and the wings, and the letters as well. Let's go ahead and cut\nthis off right here. And we'll save this heart for our test. And always keep your little\nscraps off to the side, away from your work\narea so that they don't get mixed in with other things. All right, so here's our\nheart, we'll set that there. Now the design has hollow wings. So we will just use the weeding tool to just sort of scrape\nit away, that's all I do. And then I usually pull\nit away with my fingers, once I've got a good grip on it. And it's not a difficult project to weed. The trickiest part is the letters. I did intentionally put easy things and hard things in this design, because if you're a beginning\nand trying to learn, it's helpful to have both. And then if it turns out that\nyou can't get these letters weeded very well, you could\nalways just cut them out, right? Worst comes to worst. All right, so we need to get\nthe top of our heart here. There's the top. And we keep our bit of\nvinyl off to the side. And the bottom. And then we also have , okay now, kind of usually hold this up to the light to see which parts you need. You can of course use a light box. But I am not using one today. But always, these little\nbits, if they get stuck anywhere on your plastic,\nyou know the carrier sheet they might get transferred to your tshirt, so always keep those\noff of your work surface as you are weeding. And that comes away from the T as well. And there's a section\nbetween the F and the T. And the bottom of the F. There we go. Now as I said, these letters are going to be the trickiest part,\ndown here where it says Jennifer Maker, it's\ndefinitely the trickiest part. You just be patient and if you need to, you could use your tweezers\nto get the little bits off without hurting the letters. All right, there we have\nweeded our whole design. Let's see if I can give\nyou a better look at this. And that's what it looks like. And this is how it will pair\nwhen we put it on our shirt. So now it's time to\napply our iron on design onto our tshirt. I'm gonna start with the Easy Press, because I think many people have it and it's really, I really\nthink it's quite a bit superior to an iron and that\nmakes it a little easier to do. So we're gonna do a test\nwith the Easy Press. And we're gonna make sure\nthat this heart applies and the carrier sheet\ncomes off and it looks good using our settings. So this is our Cricut pressing mat. And we're going to use the yellow shirt. All right, so I'm gonna\nput this heart right here in the corner just like\nthis so that we can test it and make sure that our settings are good. Of course, we need to figure out what the right settings are. So there is a whole\ninteractive calculator online, the Cricut EasyPress Interactive\nQuick Reference Guide will tell you exactly what temperature and how long to preheat\nand how much pressure, and what everything that you need to do to get excellent results\nwithout having to guess at it. I still like to do the test though, because I mean tshirts aren't inexpensive. All right, so here we go. So we're going to use Everyday\nIron On as our material. And our base material is 100% cotton. And we are using a Cricut EasyPress Mat. And this now tells us\nexactly what we need to use for our project. So it wants us to prewash\nitem, which I have. Again, without fabric softener. Set the temperature to 315 degrees, preheat for five seconds,\napply heat and gentle pressure for 30 seconds. Flip the material over\nand press for 15 seconds. Peel off warm. And of course, you know, you need to allow 24 hours before you wash it. All right, so let's do that. All right, so we're gonna\nturn on the Cricut EasyPress with the power button right there. We want to set it to\n315 degrees so we click, we press the thermometer button. Just once, and then press the plus sign until we're at 315. Then press the thermometer button again. And we want 30 seconds,\nwhich it's already set to but if you don't know how to do that, you press the stopwatch button. And then you use the plus and minus signs to adjust it to the proper length of time. And then you press the\nstopwatch button again. So right now we have it\nset to 315 for 30 seconds, which is going to be\nour maximum press time, so that's the right time\nthat we want to use. And the instructions call\nfor preheating our material. And all that means is we're\ngonna take our EasyPress and we're gonna press\nit down on our material for at least five seconds,\nit can be a little longer. I don't think that part really matters. The idea is you wanna heat it up so that it removes moisture, it kind of also preshrinks the tshirt as well. And it gets it ready for the\niron on vinyl application. So that's pretty important. Now you do wanna wait\nuntil your Cricut EasyPress says that it's on the right temperature. But what I love about\nthis is that we can say a specific temperature, which\nwe can't do with our iron. And it'll also time it for us. And it's got, also has this\nreally excellent flat surface that makes it so much easier to use. And this, by the way, is the\nsmallest Cricut EasyPress. And there are two other sizes. But this project is fine\nwith the smaller size. All right, so we're all ready to go. We're at 315, we have our\ntimer set for 30 seconds. We're gonna start by\npreheating our surface for five seconds. You can press this button\nand it'll count down five seconds if you don't\nwanna just guess at it. All right, that's five seconds. All right, so now we want to\nplace our heart, our test, in the corner just like this. Right, now we're placing it, kind of there's a sticky\nside to the carrier sheet and a non-sticky side. You're pressing the sticky\nside down just like this, and make sure there's no\nother little bits of anything, little, you know, parts that you weeded or anything like that. Make sure your Cricut EasyPress\nsays the right temperature and number of seconds again. And then we're going\nto place it on our mat, and we're going to press the green button that starts the timer. And you want to give it gentle pressure. That means that you don't\ngive, you know, lean into it. You don't compress your mat. You're just giving it a gentle pressure. So I'm just gently pushing\ndown right now on my tshirt. There should be some\npressure, but it should be, you know, firm pressure\nor anything like that. Just gentle. And we're going to wait\nuntil we are a little, our Cricut EasyPress will\nbeep when it's all finished. All right. And now we need to flip it over and press it again for 15 seconds. Same temperature, 15 seconds. And there we go. So we can just watch the\ncount down on the EasyPress to make sure that we're doing 15 seconds. You don't need to move it around like you might with an iron. You're just pressing\ndown with gentle pressure for this particular\nsetting, for this shirt, and this iron on material. All right, now our next\nstep is to peel off warm. That does not mean peel off hot. Because right now it's very hot. If you were press your finger on this, you could even burn your finger. You want to wait a little\nbit, until it's warm to the touch instead of hot to the touch. So you know, that will\ndepend a little bit. You know, 10, 15 seconds,\nmaybe 30 seconds. I like to lift up the\ncorner, see how it feels. Does it feel too hot? Definitely too hot, when you press on it and it feels too hot, it's too hot. So you just wanna give it a little time. Don't confuse warm peel with hot peel. It's when a... So the plastic is now warm. All right, so now I would\nsay it's warm instead of hot. So we're going to gently\npeel off the carrier sheet. Just like that. And we have our heart. I'm gonna give you a closer look at this. So here's a closer look\nat what it looks like. You can see that it looks\nlike it's pretty well adhered. I don't see it pulling off anywhere. All right, so we've determined that, so our heart looks good and\nour EasyPress setting are good so we're ready to actually\ncreate this shirt. The next step is position our design so it's centered on the shirt. Because if we just guess,\nwe might not get it right. Let's move this over a little bit. So I could totally just eyeball\nthis and say, put it here. What you can do is use the tag at the top as a center mark for the heart. But there is a center\nmark for your design, but there is a better way, actually. I recommend that you take your shirt and you fold it in half. So match up your sleeves. Like this. And fold it in half. Just like this. And use your EasyPress or your\niron to just put a little, little crease there, just a little bit. Right, just a little bit of one. So that we could determine\nthe exact center. And now with you open it up, you will see that you\ncan see the exact center of your shirt, which is right here. Right, so now we know\nexactly where the center is, and smooth that out so\nthere's no wrinkles. You can still just barely see that. I can, maybe you can't, but I\ncan definitely see the crease. Now we use that crease\nto center our design. I prepared this design\nwith a very easy way to see our center, which\nis the center of the heart. So this is a great beginner piece. Now your next thing that\nyou might be wondering is, where on the shirt do you put it? Do you put it in the exact\nmiddle of your shirt? So this would be about the exact middle. Do you put it, or how\nhigh up do you put it. So especially, you know, I really think that it's best to put\nthis up a little higher. So I like to put it in the\nupper half of the shirt. I think that looks a lot\nbetter when you do it that way, especially on women. So that we can see the\ndesign and it doesn't get hidden or you know,\nmessed up or whatever because of the shape of the body. It doesn't look weird. So I definitely think the\ndesign is gonna look better in the top half. Right, and to determine\nthe top half of the docu, of the shirt, just fold that in half, and then we know that\nthis is the half here. And so we just center\nthat in the top half. So as long as we've got this\ncentered about right here, this is gonna be just right, right here. This will look great. So we wanna just kind of\nremember this position because we need to preheat our shirt before we apply our design, remember. Just like we did our heart earlier. So I'm gonna set this down here and we're going to use our EasyPress to preheat the area for five seconds. All right. Now we're going to place our design right in the spot that we've\nidentified as being ideal, which would be right here. And you can press it down slightly and it'll kind of stick. It won't stick a lot, but\nenough so that you can put your design on and you know, place it here and then do your EasyPress. Okay, so now it's time to do\nthe pressing for 30 seconds. I'm gonna set this right\non top, just like this. And press the timer. And apply gentle pressure. Make sure your whole design is covered. Oh, I see we're just a little bit too far. That's okay. So what I'm gonna do\nthen, is we're gonna do half of our design on one side and then I will switch\nit to the other side for another 30 seconds. Since we're using the smaller EasyPress. And again, I'm using gentle pressure. All right, and then\nI'm gonna slide it down and do the other half. Just like this. So I'm just lining it up\nright in the very center. So I know exactly where\nto do the other half. And again, just gentle pressure. You don't need to use firm\npressure for this project, and it's important that you don't. It's no more heat and no more pressure is not the solution when\nyou're having issues. Usually the best thing to do is to follow the directions in the Interactive\nGuide for the EasyPress. All right, so now we can flip this over and do the other side for 15 seconds. So for this side I'm gonna kind of just move it back and forth a little bit so it has even heat across it's design, so we don't have to do it twice. I wouldn't wanna do that\nfor the front though, in case that we slid the carrier sheet when we were doing it. But it works okay for the back. All right. So we turn this over and just\nlike with our test heart, we want to wait until our\ndesign is warm instead of hot. It's very important. If you try to peel it when it's hot, it will attempt to peel\nthe vinyl off as well, so it's important that we wait until it's the right temperature. Again, I like to start\nby touching the edges of the plastic, until that feels warm. And then when it does, I\ntouch the design itself. Just be careful, you can\ndefinitely burn yourself, your finger when you're testing. So be mindful of that. It's still definitely hot right now. All right, so now it's warm\nto the touch instead of hot. So now we're gonna gently peel it up. And it's like magic\nbecause our pretty design stays on the shirt without any, you know, weird peeling or coming off or anything because we followed the directions exactly as it told us\nto and that's the key. Cricut has already done\nall of the research to determine what's going to\nwork best with the EasyPress and the material that you're using, and also what you're pressing it on. And again, I'm using\nthe Cricut Pressing Mat, but if you don't have one,\nyou can use a folded towel. What you don't want to\nuse is an ironing board or something like that,\nthat does not work. So there is our finished design. Doesn't that look awesome? That turned out great,\nit's gonna be amazing. And that is really it. All right, so what if you\ndon't have an EasyPress, but you have an iron. I'm gonna show you how that works as well, I've already cut out a design\nand I have my iron turned on. We're going to use the back side of the yellow tshirt\nto do the second design using our iron. Now we're gonna do a test again, just to be absolutely sure. Now you need to set your\ndial to the cotton setting. This is a cotton shirt\nand you have to preheat your shirt for 10 to 15 seconds. It's important always to\npreheat and post heat. And you wanna place your weeded image, liner side up onto the preheated material. And you want to apply medium\npressure with the iron for 25 to 30 seconds. Now you'll notice the bottom of the iron and the EasyPress are different. And the heat is not as evenly\ndistributed on the iron, and so you want to get\nyour iron positioned over the center of your\nimage or your design, as much as you possibly can. It really will make a difference. And you'll notice that\nit stuck to the plastic for a moment just right there. So I'm gonna get a\npiece of parchment paper because I don't trust\nmy iron to not be hurt by that plastic. I don't know why it did that. We're just gonna get some parchment paper and then we don't have to worry about it. And this is just plain old,\nhousehold parchment paper. Nothing special besides that. So here we go, I'm just gonna\nlay that parchment paper right over my design just to protect the surface of my iron. And then we're going to, gonna apply medium pressure\nfor 25 to 30 seconds. Again, we're trying to position the iron right over the image as\nmuch as we possible can. And when we're done, we're\ngonna flip our shirt over, and again we're gonna\napply medium pressure with the iron to the back of the material for an extra 25 to 30 seconds. And just like before, you wanna\npeel it off warm, not hot. When it feels good, go ahead and peel off the carrier sheet and there you go. It looks the same as the one that I did with my EasyPress. All right, so now let's also, now that we've done our\ntest and it worked okay, we're going to put our design\non the back of the shirt. Now it's a little tricker\nbecause we already have our design on the front. And this is where this EasyPress Mat comes in so handy because\ncan put it right inside the shirt, it's the perfect size for it. And it fits right in there\nand we don't have to worry about harming our original vinyl design. It's probably fine, but\nhey, why take chances? And I'm gonna use the tag\non the back of the shirt to identify the center of it. Just like before, we need\nto preheat our material for 10 to 15 seconds. And then we place our design\nwith the carrier sheet up, liner up, onto our shirt and press it down so it's in place and\nwe're gonna put that piece of parchment on there again\njust to be on the safe side. I rather like this iron,\nI don't wanna ruin it. And we're gonna cover our design and apply medium pressure\nfor 25 to 30 seconds. And the directions of\neach type of Cricut vinyl are available just by Googling Cricut and then the name of the vinyl. So right now I'm looking\nat Cricut Everyday Iron On and Application Instructions. Which I will link in the\ndescription for this video, as well as in my tutorial over on my blog. All right, so now we need to flip it over, and that's tricky of\ncourse because this is a double sided shirt, right? So I'm gonna turn it\ninside out and then slip my cutting mat into the inside out shirt, and to press it down for\nanother 25 to 30 seconds with my iron. All right, so let's turn\nthis right side out. And again, we wanna wait\nuntil the carrier sheet is warm, not hot. And our design is also warm, not hot. So you know, 15 to 20\nseconds approximately. You wanna go by feel, just\nbe careful with your fingers. When it looks good, go\nahead and peel it off. And there we go, that worked great. It looks good, feels good. Awesome. And here's how it looks\nwhen it was all done. Everything worked great. So you can use an iron or an EasyPress, it's really up to you and what you want. I prefer the EasyPress\nbecause I don't have to guess at the temperature or the time, but an iron also works. All right, so I'm gonna do a bunch more so that you can see what they look like. This is holographic sparkle,\nwhich I thought was so pretty. I love this, it's gotta\nbe one of my favorites. It was not difficult to\nweed or apply at all. Isn't that just so pretty? Definitely very pretty. And this is Cricut holographic\nsparkle iron on vinyl. And this is Cricut mesh in red. And I think that it's mostly used for like jerseys and such, but it also, I thought it was really cute. Now this is Cricut\nglitter, which I just adore how this looks and I had\nno problems applying it or anything like that. Isn't that cute? Look at that, look how shiny that is. It turned out great, I love the glitter. And this is Cricut foil\nin rose gold, I believe, which is the same exact color\nthat I have on my apron. And I love this color\ncombination, this rose gold and the turquoise, ah this is so pretty. These different iron on finishes are just so much fun to play with. Okay, this might be my favorite. I mean, look at that. I love that it was even\ngood enough to transfer the Jennifer Maker because\nsome of them weren't. You know, for the mesh\none and the glitter one, that was much too find a detail. But the foil one did great. The pattern one was not able\nto transfer Jennifer Maker, but otherwise, I had no\nissues transferring its design to my shirt. And for an experiment, I\ntried putting sport flex on my cotton shirt. Now this is not recommended. Sport flex is for stretchy materials, but I didn't it anyways just\nto see what would happen because some people try it. I don't recommend it, it did work. However, I don't know how\nwell it's going to last, but just as an experiment,\nI did it anyways. I love to test things. So the foil, the pattern,\nand the sport flex. Now to take care of your\nawesome new iron on shirt, it's really important\nthat you allow at least 24 hours after you apply your\nvinyl before you wash it. And when you do wash\nit, turn it inside out and wash and tumble dry. And it's important that\nyou don't bleach it because it'll mess with your vinyl. And it should last at least 50 washes. That is what Cricut says\nabout their product, and in my experience that is very true. I made a tshirt for my\ndaughter a little under two years ago. It's been washed many\ntimes and it still looks just as good as when we first made it. And it was my first tshirt then too. So I think this is a really\ngood beginner project and it's so much fun to\nmake your own tshirts that are personalized and\nlook virtually as good as you might be able to buy in a store. Now if you have problems\nwith your iron on vinyl, and it seems to pull away when you pull at your carrier sheet, it\ncould mean a lot of things. The first thing it may\nmean is that it's just a little bit too soon to pull it away, so stop and wait until it's\ncooled off a little bit more. You still wanna pull most vinyls, not all but most vinyls\nthat we do are warm peel, not cool peel. Though not all, you can check\nthe Cricut Interactive Guide tells you whether it's a\nwarm peel or cold peel. And I also indicate that in my blog post about this tutorial. If that still doesn't work,\ngive it some more heat. So put the carrier sheet back on and apply some more heat with\nthe same amount of pressure. And that's typically the only two things I've ever had to do to fix any problems with iron on vinyl. It's either I pulled it up too fast, or there just really wasn't enough heat. Now one thing I want to\nnote is that some people say that it's really\nimportant that you be able to see the fibers of your\nshirt through your vinyl. And by that I mean, you could\nsee the texture of the shirt. Now I did a lot of\ntesting with specifically the Cricut Everyday Iron On, which I think is what most people are going to be using. And I found the only time that I could get the fibers to show through the vinyl was when I applied too much heat. In other words, I did it\ntwo or three pressings, which I know is not accurate. And I did a little\nresearch and I don't think that it's true that every case you want to see the fibers through your vinyl. You wanna see the texture of it. And in fact, Caesar which\nis an iron on vinyl company, heat transfer vinyl\ncompany that know way more than I do about this, they agree with me. They say that you don't always have to see the texture of your fibers through it for it to be applied correctly. So don't fall into the trap of thinking that you have to see that. What I do notice however,\nthat with correctly applied vinyl I can feel the texture. So it doesn't feel totally smooth. I can feel that the vinyl\nhas melted into the fabric of the shirt and it's, you\nknow, it feels very flat. It doesn't feel like it's\ngoing to wanna peel off when I run my hand over it. And there's a definitely\ntexture on the vinyl itself. So that's what I look for because we don't want\nto over press our shirts and burn our shirts or burn our vinyl, because if we have too much heat we could also harm the adhesive\nand that could cause it to peel after you wear it or wash it. So that's not the answer. So just keep in mind you\ndon't always have to see the texture of the fibers\nthrough your vinyl. Now this tutorial is a, covered a very basic and simple design using a variety of different\niron on vinyls, right? Which you might be\nwondering, can you combine and layer colors? Why, yes you can. And you can put vinyl over\nanother layer of vinyl, just so long as you don't try\nto put anything over glitter, or glitter, mesh or flocked vinyl. In fact I have a whole\ntutorial on layering iron on vinyl that you might really enjoy, if you're ready to take your\ntshirts to the next level.

Domenica here from easy sewing for\nbeginners.com In this video today I'll be showing you how to operate this mini\nsewing machine. Now when you first get the sewing machine out of the box it'll\nlook a little something like this it'll have a piece of fabric already in it and\nit will already be threaded what I'm going to show you today is how to thread\nthe machine how to wind the bobbin and how to get it all set up we're ready to\nsee if some thread does run out or if some thread comes out of the needle you\nknow exactly what to do okay so what I'm going to do is I'm going to remove this\nfabric so the presser foot is down at the moment so I'm going to lift the\npresser foot there's a little lever at the back here I'm going to lift that up\nand that will bring your presser foot up I'm going to take that fabric out and\nI'm going to unthread the whole machine now I'm going to plug the machine in so\nwe have some power so you can either insert your batteries at this stage or\nyour power plug and you'll also need your foot pedal plugged in unless you\nwant to use the on/off button there so this is all plugged in and ready to\ngo next you'll need your thread and your empty bobbin so to wind the bobbin I'm\ngoing to pull this spool pin up here to put my thread onto like so and\nthen I need to release this bobbin winding pin so it's on the hand wheel\nhere looks like a little button so I'm going to press it inwards and then turn my\nfinger towards me and it should pop that little bobbin pin out and to put it back\nin you just push it in and turn it away from you. okay and then I'm going to put\nthe end of this thread through one of the holes and you can wind it on a bit\nif you like to get it started and firmly push it on as you don't want\nit falling off while you're winding okay so I'm going to put\nmy foot on the presser foot on the foot pedal sorry and I'm going to hold this\nthread out to provide the tension and I'll need to also move it from side to\nside okay so you get the idea. to take it off\npull it off gently okay and you can use your little thread cutter on the side of\nthe sewing machine there if you like and then don't forget to push your pin back\nin turn it push it back in and turn it away from you to lock it in there okay\nand and you might just need to snip that little bit of excess thread off. now I'm going to thread the top part of the machine so you can actually if you want\njust use this thread from the thread spool and thread it from here but I'll\nshow you how to use this little thread holder here. so this one has a pin we're\ngoing to pull that pin out and it has a spring that provides the tension so\ndon't lose that spring so I'm going to grab that pin I'm going to put my new bobbin spool of thread onto that pin and\npush it into that hole. now I've tested it with the thread coming off this way and\nwith the thread coming off underneath and it's pretty much the same so I don't\nthink that matters too much. alright we're going to thread the machine now so\nthis is your first thread guide so you need to pass it through from right to\nleft just going to pull it so I have a bit of thread to work with alright next the thread needs to go into the tension disks which are right here. so pull it\ndown so it's sitting nicely in between those tension disks. the next thread\nguide is right here you need to thread it through from right to left if you can\nget your fingers in there. just make sure doesn't get caught on anything. okay your\nnext thread guide is on the take-up lever up here so you need to pass it\nthrough from right to left okay and the next thread guide is right\nhere now there is a light on here as wel.l I don't find it terribly useful but\nturn it on might help. I'm going to pass it through\nthe next red guide right here from top to bottom okay now the next thread guide is\nright in here on the top of the needle bar. pass it through from top to bottom\nagain. okay and then the last part of threading the top of the sewing machine\nis putting the thread through the needle so I'm going to make sure the needle is\nin the highest position so I'm just going to turn the hand wheel towards me\nuntil that needle is in its highest position. so that's about there and you\nneed to thread the needle going from left to right now I struggle with that\nso I'm going to use this needle threader so I'm going to put the needle threader\nin from the right. pull my thread through the threader and then pull it through\nthere. well let me try that again okay there we go so I'm going to pull\nthat thread all the way through. next I'm going to load in the bobbin for the\nbottom thread so to do this you need to have your bobbin your thread running in\na clockwise direction so when you hold your bobbin up with your thread it\nshould almost look like the letter q so they'll help you remember. so we're gonna\ndrop the bobbin in to that little spot on the bobbin holder down there\nand you can just rest your thread in that little thread guide there I don't\nthink it's essential but it's there and then I'm going to turn the hand wheel\ntowards me and this will take the thread down and over that bobbin in the bottom\nthere and then once the needle comes back up you can gently pull the thread\ntowards you and that should bring the bobbin thread up as well and then you\ncan carefully just pull it out put your threads under the presser foot there and\ntowards the back and your machine is ready to sew just replace that bobbin\ncover there. there we go okay so before you start sewing with your mini sewing machine I'm going to sew a bit of fabric and share a few tips that\nI've worked out that'll help with using the sewing machine so I've got my fabric\nready my machine is all threaded up what I recommend you do is put your fabric\nunder the presser foot lower your presser foot down and before you put\nyour foot on the foot pedal turn the hand wheel towards you a couple of times\njust to put that needle up and down and put a couple of stitches into the fabric\nand that'll hold your thread in because I found if I didn't do that the machine\nwill want to pull the thread out and it would break and I'd have to rethread the\nmachine okay so that should be good to go so I'm\ngonna actually do a couple of stitches and then I'm actually going to swivel\nthis fabric because this machine doesn't have a reverse function and you want to\nsecure your threads I'm going to put the needle into the down position so it's in\nthe fabric going to lift my presser foot swivel my fabric and you do this right\nat the very end or right at the beginning when you start with a\npresser foot down do a few stitches going in the other direction. put my needle\ndown and then I can swivel it back and that will hold my stitching in nice and\nsecure otherwise it'll come undone and it won't be very it wont last very long\nalright so now I'm going to sew okay and the same again when you get to\nthe end put your needle in the down position secure your stitching alright and then what I recommend you do when you're done just put your foot on the\nfoot pedal and let the thread come through a bit okay you can either snip it off with\nyour scissors or use this little thread cutter up here okay and I've found that\nthat helps with getting some of the thread through otherwise if you lift\nthe presser foot up and try and pull the thread the machine doesn't like it and\nit puts a lot of pressure onto your take-up lever and it just you're you're\ngoing to break your thread so I've done it a few times. so there's my stitching\nthere's the top you can see that a bit clearer and there's the bottom okay so\nhave a play around with yours and I'll show you how to change the needle next", "Pz1gHg_R3Fk": "Oh y'all she got C paramedic down there I ordered this cotton subs it's a fabric material that you can heat press sublimation

button down shirt or ocbd if i interchange between those two words so you know and we're going to talk about them from brands that could range down to 20 up to the multi hundred dollar shirts but if there is one shirt that needs to be in your wardrobe it is the oxford cotton button down for many different reasons is a shirt that can look good on anybody whether you are big or small or short or tall it is also one of those shirts that has been around forever it's a classic but also looks just as modern today depending on the fit and that's what i want to talk about as we dive in here so i do want to talk a little bit about the history of the oxford cotton button down and then i'm going to run down the brands in the roundup style where i'm going to cover the wide range of prices that are out there and tell you what to look for as you are shopping for one of these shirts brooks brothers is the company that brought the oxford cotton button down to the world in 1896 at a time when shirts had removable collars they were extremely stiff and brooks brothers brought this to polo players whose collars used to flap up in the wind and that's why this button is right here to keep it buttoned down so the shirts were really made for sport they were also a much more casual but as the popularity grew especially in the 60s with the preppy ivy league looks and now it is just a staple in modern wardrobes and especially as we move into more business casual and smart casual looks the oscar cotton button down looks better than ever when building your shirt collection it is absolutely worth having at least one if not three shirts in your collection that's going to be a light blue is probably the one that i would start with and then a white and then a pink is a really easy one to go with that's like the holy trinity of oxford cotton button-down shirts and what makes the ocbd so adaptable and ralph lauren is a great example of this is that it can be used in so many different colors but then on top of that it can be worn from totally casual just untucked button down even short sleeve shirt up to a completely formal look sands buttons and you can have a nice point collar on there so you can have it go from the most casual looks to pretty formal looks pretty easily as part of the oxford cloth the button is what you usually would break from as you go into the most formal shirts but even then i think an oxford cotton button down with a nice tie looks really good maybe just not with a tuxedo here's what you want to look for as you are shopping for oxford cotton button downs you want to find something that is at least a medium or a heavier weight oxford cotton button down the best part about these shirts is that they get better with each wash they're kind of like denim in that way the more you wash them the softer they get and they just feel more comfortable and kind of break in what i find from a lot of fast fashion brands whether that's top man or h m or or some of the like low end shirts that you find for twenty dollars is that the cloth isn't substantial enough to withstand multiple washes that's really what you want and to me that's what it's all about is having a shirt that looks good now can wash really easily and then continue wearing beyond that unfortunately there is no standard way to say like a garment weight or it's not really publicized on a lot of these websites so it's really more about the fabric feel but a really good indicator is the price what i've found across the board here is that you're probably going to get a good one for about 60 now you can find brooks brothers ones marked down to 50 same thing with ralph lauren that's really a sweet spot for where you're going to find a shirt that has a nice enough fabric that's going to be substantial last long and look good so now you're ready to buy an oxford cotton button down where do you go from there well there's a few categories to start with there's really the starter brands that i'm going to mention then there's what i would consider like the value so shirts that are a little bit more expensive but they use a really nice fabric and they also have really good fit options then i want to run down some custom options for you because there's a ton of custom options that are not much more than those value brands so you're looking just around 100 maybe a little bit less and then i want to talk about some of the more formal some of the really nice ones and each of the brands especially in the custom space will offer you know a casual roll button-down collar as well as a formal one so it's really about doing a little bit of shopping here and i'm also putting these in order by category by my recommendations i'm going to give you a list of a couple of them to look for in each category and my top recommendation is the first one that i mentioned as i go down the list as you're looking to shop for new clothes we'll begin with the starter groups if you want a great oxford cotton button-down shirt price is your biggest component let's start with spear and mckay spirit mckay makes some amazing clothes whether it's their suits but their oscar cotton button downs are some of the best value out there bar none they also have a great fit i've had this one for a couple of years and i think it's one of the best places to start the next one is a really easy one it's uniqlo especially if you're a smaller shorter guy they have really nice slim fits and their prices are excellent and then i would start with land's end lands end especially when they're discounting they have some really nice cloth and i also have a ton of available styles lands end uh is one that i have slept on for too long so i check out lanzand brooks brothers you can definitely find a lot of deals on but depending on which line you're shopping whether it's like the red fleece or their main line they're one of those traditional retailers that i find can be hit or miss these past few years but just given the heritage of the brand itself i wanted to put this in one of the top recommended and then kamakura shirt makers this is a lesser-known brand i think it's more known in like the reddit groups that i'm in as far as being like a really cool niche brand but i have a couple of their shirts and these are also really nice slim fitting ones so if you're a smaller guy looking for a great slim fit and a great deal then kamakura shirt maker is a good one now for value this is kind of the middle market of the dress shirts and part of this is that these brands end up discounting a lot so even though you know ralph lauren has a 89 or 98 ticket price you end up finding them for cheaper and ralph lauren as well as brooks brothers are also two of the brands that you can really get away with having a logo on the shirt i would avoid that for most of the other ones everlane at 62.00 in their uniform makes one of the best oxford cotton button downs out there especially for the price the one that i've had i've had for several years watched it many times and i think it's just a great value overall this one here is from mac weldon mac weldon actually integrates 37.5 technology into the shirt which helps with odor control and temperature control and this is one where i've washed it a couple of times and i find myself just wearing it a lot as a very comfortable shirt on the daily and i like it so much that it's the shirt that i'm wearing for this video now this is the mac welding shirt then the other places bonobos especially if you're looking in this price point for multiple fit options whether it's trim fit slim fit standard fit bonobos always has you covered on there and then the last couple to always check out is gap j crew banana republic they run so many sales and you can end up getting the shirts for a really good deal and i find that they're nice enough that you know if you're just trying to get like a 50 or 60 shirt then you're gonna be covered now for the custom group and this one's interesting because you know you can pick basically any color or cloth on a lot of these ones and i'm also again i'm putting these in recommended based on you know priority to me one of the best shirt makers for this especially in the custom space and it hits kind of like it's like a two bird one stone thing right it's ratio ratio shirts mixer shirts in the usa and the oxford cotton button down that i have from them is one of the most substantial nicest oscar cotton button downs that i own that said it's over 100 it's about 135 back when i ordered it and so you are gonna be paying a little bit more and on top of that they're able to do it without having you take measurements so you can put in your height weight your body type and they have a smart size for you so that you can then get the shirt without having to measure it and to me those three things make it worth one of the best customs out there the next one's gonna be todd shelton todd shelton has a really cool system for getting your fit down they have a fit kit that you can order try it on get the right size and these are also made in the usa another one that's a little bit higher priced but a really beautiful high quality cloth and the shirts aren't actually made to measure but they're custom because you can customize the fit size and a few details on the shirt as well next you have woodies woody's has a couple of oxford cloth shirts in their collection and this is another one where they have a fit guarantee it is custom made you can customize parts of the shirt but you also don't have to do measurements and they will make sure you get the right fit on the shirt over time and so woody's is one of always my highest recommendations for getting started with custom clothing and then there's proper cloth proper cloth slightly higher priced in woodies but a little bit wider a fabric selection on there and based on your feedback one of the most consistent custom shirt companies that are out there next is deo veritas deo veritas has you covered in a wide range of prices and styles and a ton of custom options they also have a cue sizing algorithm and so the key here with the custom shirts is yes there's a few really nice ones that are made in the usa the other ones to look out for are the companies that you can put in your measurements but you don't have to because i know it can be a little bit daunting as you're starting the maid to measure space next you have a pasta this is an italian company and they do have just a ton of fabric options a ton of custom options and then alton lane the problem with alton lane is that you cannot order unless you go into their showroom and get measured at least the last time that i checked you had to have a fit profile and then you can order online otherwise you had to like call somebody on the phone and go through the measurement process or go into one of their showrooms but alton lane is another good one where you can probably get a really nice cotton button-down shirt and finally the dress category so if you do want a really nice oxford cotton button-down shirt and you need it to be a little bit more formal these companies will have you covered some of them are also custom you can adjust the things in there but i think this is just a nice category to go look into leadberry always one of my top recommendations for amazing dress shirts they have some really nice formal looks in there that's really their brand right it's really high-end formal nice-looking stuff j press is a good example where it is a formal higher-end look and a higher end price but if that's what you're looking for some of the best of the best stuff out there you definitely want to take a look at j press similarly you have gitmin which is another high-end one but they do have some really nice formal shirts and then oliver wicks this is a custom shirt maker but they have some really high quality like tessa tora monty oxford cotton shirts my custom oxford cotton shirts come from them and i absolutely love them and last but certainly not least i just did a video on eaten shirts eaten has some incredible fabrics and they also have really nice options if you like the color or one of the shirts that they have you can customize the fit but then they also have your sleeve lengthening sleeve shortening so you can basically get a custom shirt from them but also their thing is just very high-end very beautiful looking shirts so you're gonna get a really nice one coming from eaton shirts there you have it gents a rundown of the oxford cotton button-down shirts or ocbd so if you run into that term online or if you're looking to really expand or have those staples in your shirt collection that is where the oxford cotton button down comes into place let me know if there's companies that i missed if you look at that original dress shirt video that i did i was really talking about the way the shirts fit me and i'm trying to be more conscious of the way that the shirts can fit everybody because not everybody's built like me and so i'm trying to evolve the roundup format and your feedback is always super appreciated as i do that and as i continue to put out more videos like this as always my dms are open so if you have any questions i'd love to answer them over there but of course i'll get to every comment that i can down below as well hope you guys are staying safe and healthy right now this is shot during the quarantine but i'm trying not to let that stop me here and give you a sense of normalcy because the world will continue and we will get through this this too shall pass stay safe out there guys until next time gents this is the [Music] cavalier you", "ex1iFyfLUTM": "- [JJ] Yoh,

Would you like one? - What a sellout, no. (guys laugh) - Oh my God.\n- Oh my God. - Hi, I'm JJ, I'm 26. What's the chances of my balls\nslapping your ass tonight? - All right, no, get out.

buffalo plaid okay so you're probably thinking oh you guys had these in before but this one's a little different so this one is sherpa lined it's so soft i love it um the sleeves are not sherpa lined it's just the body um so it's nice and warm and cozy um the sleeves there's no stretch um there it's like a thicker material than the other ones the other ones are a little more lightweight um these ones are running a little bit bigger so i'm in a size small and usually i get these in a medium and i can button it up and as you can see i still have lots of room so i would say size down or if you like you know a loose comfy flannel fit then just wear your normal size um we have all the sizes guys so we have a small through 3x which is super exciting so snag these up if you missed out on the last ones and these ones are a little bit warmer for winter and they're so so cute love it so small through 3x order online or come see me have a great day bye guys", "3vuQseWRksw": "hi everyone thanks for joining me I'm excited today I have partnered with a dye press and they are a company that has a product that allows you to use sublimation ink or your infusible ink on 100% cotton t-shirts yeah hundred percent cotton t-shirts we're no longer limited by the t-shirts that are available in the infusible ink line or the t-shirts that are available in the sublimation line so now we can use 100% cotton t-shirts that's what I did for this this is a 100% Gildan t-shirt just like you get at Joanns we've all had some of these and look at those results that's 100% cotton t-shirt with sublimation printing this is permanent washable dryable not going to go away this is a permanent design it's not going to crack it's not going to peel you can see if I spread it apart it's part of the fabric it's not laying on top it's not a transfer like an iron-on this is 100% cotton t-shirt with a very permanent result this is in fusible ink on a 100% just a plain old fruit of the line 100% cotton t-shirt in fusible link I used this in fusible link this one 100% cotton shirt you can't feel it this is permanent it's not going to go away you can wash it dry it again permanent I also tried it on a colored shirt now keep in mind anytime you use in fusible link or sublimation ink on a cotton t-shirt it's a translucent ink so the color of the shirt is going to show through but it still worked on this fluorescent pink shirt I got a transfer and you know of course it's colored or kind of changed color by the color of the shirt because it's a translucent ink but this is permanent so we can now use in fusible link on colored t-shirts we can use sublimation ink on colored t-shirts we can use our favorite cotton t-shirts I mean come on the possibilities are endless and I am absolutely thrilled with the results of this product this is the product that are talking about it's called Die Presse this is poly T plus it comes in a concentrated bottle like this you you mix this with water we'll go into all of that in the next part of the video but you use the concentrate you mix it with some water you put it in the spray bottle and you treat the shirt and then you can treat it just like any other iron-on or any other sublimation transfer or confusable ink transfer it does something to the fabric there's something magical in it but it does something in the fabric that allows it to take the ink so this the beauty of this is that you can't feel this it's washable it's dryable not gonna crack not gonna peel it's on there for good and why not I love it so let's get started into the video and I'm going to show you how I made each of these projects so let's take a look at the instructions here so it tells you for one ounce of poly t+ mix it with three ounces of water and that will give you 4 ounces of spray or you could take a quarter cup mix it with 3/4 cup water and that makes eight ounces of spray for this particular spray bottle they've got it right on here I need 2 ounces of the poly T plus 2 6 ounces of water and it's going to make eight ounces of spray so that's what we're going to do it goes on and has more information if you have a bigger or smaller spray bottle or you just want to mix up a little batch so one bottle of this is going to go quite a ways so the first thing it tells me is 2 ounces of poly T plus so let's put two ounces of poly T a plus in here and I have a little funnel just to make sure that I don't make a mess I haven't opened this yet so let's see I don't know if we have to open a tap here yep so we need two ounces of this got a measuring cup here two ounces of poly T plus now we're just going to put that in our spray bottle and it's telling me to add six ounces of purified water so I'm going to fill this up with six ounces there we go so that's it that's all you need I think it's pretty cool that they let you mix it themselves I watched her video and she said why should we why should you as a consumer pay to ship water when you all have water at home so they've made a concentrate which makes the product go much further and saves on shipping cost we're almost there all right we've got six ounces of water so I'm just going to go ahead and turn my spray bottle into mix shake it up and it looks like that so let's make sure we've got it primed must be a oh there's a little stopper right here you just need to turn that to the side to get some bottle to work oh we're already primed so we're good there okay so you can see I have a Gildan 100% cotton t-shirt right here this is 100% cotton now if you want a more vibrant print the more polyester that's in it the better so even if you had a 40% it's going to give you a little bit of a more vibrant result but we're going to go with 100% cotton because I want to see it actually works so I'm just gonna put a towel on my surface just to absorb some of the moisture all right and I have a design that I'm gonna put on the shirt that's this so it's about an 8 and a half by 11 size so I'm just going to use a piece of card stock just to kind of give me a guide and I'm gonna spray the corners just to give me a guide of where I need to spray and we're just going to begin spraying the shirts within that area the white a little bit harder to tell when it's wet I've got it pretty wet she suggests that you use a foam roller I don't have a foam roller but I do have my cricket brayer so I am just going to break it push that moisture down in the shirt and I can see now that blue behind there that I need to add a little bit more spray you want to get it pretty saturated but not sopping wet I'm just gonna push that down into the fabric so we're going to press it for 30 seconds at 330 degrees that's going to dry the poly t+ and it also removes any site and you'll probably see a little bit of steam coming out of the press that's the sizing and that's exactly what we wanted to do so we've got about ten seconds left and then we're going to give it a second coat of the poly T plus I'm just going to do that right on the press according to the directions it does not need to be as heavy of a coat this time so we're just going to take the poly key plus so we're gonna get to see what it looks like on a colored shirt I'm gonna take my roller and just roll it into the shirt place it with my parchment paper and again 330 degrees for 30 seconds now if you have the first version of this product you might have gotten a separate product to remove the sizing this new poly t+ apparently you don't need that it takes care of everything all with one product now this is the second shirt I've done you can see I've only used this much this jar is still full up to here so you can just imagine how many shirts I can do with one bottle of the poly T plus alright we're coming up on 30 seconds for our second press and we're going to open the press now the next step we need the press to be at 385 so I'm going to go ahead and raise the temperature to 385 and it's going to be at 70 seconds so while that is preheating I want to show you what the shirt looks like all right so that's going to heat back up to 385 so here is our shirt so it feels kind of starchy like it's a little bit stiff but the first time you wash the shirt that's going to come out but it as if you would put spray starch on something and then iron it kind of feels like that but it's totally dry and that is the poly coating that's going to make this so that we can sublimate again this is a 100 percent cotton Gildan t-shirt pick this up at Joanns nothing fancy about this whatsoever we're going to try it on a colored t-shirt but I want to show you this one which I look gun I forgot to turn the camera and this is the white Gildan 100% t-shirt that I was just working on and just look how good that transfer came out now again it feels kind of stiff but as soon as you watch this it's going to feel just like the t-shirt because it's now the ink is now in to the fibers of the fabric it's not laying on top so it's going to feel just like a t-shirt once you wash this but that's amazing there's not one ounce of polyester in here and we have a polyester or we have a sublimation shirt so really really believe in this product I'm really interested to see how this pink shirt does now the next step tells us to raise the heat to 385 and then pre-heat for five seconds we no longer need this on here because this has no moisture in it so I don't have to protect the press anymore so I'm just going to put this down back on the press just like it was and as soon as this hits 385 I'm going to replace my parchment paper and press it for five seconds at 385 again all of the instructions are clearly printed out for you so that you can be very successful they've taken the extra initiative and made sure that you have a good experience with this product it's not difficult at all and again she walks you through every step if you want even more instructions this it's included inside there is you can just if you put your camera on your phone on camera setting and just scan this it will open right up to their Facebook group which you can join which is called dye sublimation or you can scan this and it will take you to her YouTube video which again walks you through this step-by-step so that you are successful with this product it is I'm totally totally wild and amazed by the outcome I mean that that is just a plain white t-shirt there's nothing special about that so that means I could now open up sublimation to a whole wider variety of products so for our next design I am going to send a another picture to the Sawgrass printer there we go that should be printing out here in a second and we are almost up to 385 it's at 375 so we're gonna wait just a few more seconds one question that I wanted to address that I keep getting in the YouTube comments and on my other sublimation videos and getting messages on Facebook there seems to be some confusion about the sublimation ink and using a inkjet printer the magic is in the ink it's not in the printer it's in the ink so if you are using an inkjet printer you have to convert it to sublimation ink you can't just use regular inkjet printer some people are under the impression that if you use sublimation paper printed it out with an inkjet that that's what was happening and that's the magics not in the sublimation paper again I'm just using copy paper the magic is in the ink so you need an inkjet printer that can be switched out to sublimation ink if you're going to go that route this is a dedicated sublimation printer by Sawgrass this is my what I prefer to do I didn't want to convert a printer once you convert an inkjet printer you really shouldn't convert it back to ink jet so it's you know you you can't just go back and forth and switch it anytime you want unique because then you would have to clear out all that ink out of the lines so a sublimation ink comes out very dull you're not gonna want to use this for everyday printing plus it's going to be much more expensive so if you're going to use an inkjet printer keep in mind that once you switch it to sublimation ink you're not going to be switching it back and forth again and so you can't use regular inkjet and do this method that nut needs to be sublimation ink all right so we should be up to three eighty five we are we're going to press it for pre-press for five seconds there we go I am going to add my design facedown right on top again this is not a pink shirt so remember when you're doing sublimation on colored shirts it's not that it won't work but your ink is it's a clear ink so if there's not something white or light behind it it's probably not going to show up as well as if you were to put it on a white background so keep in mind that the ink is transparent so when you put it on a color the color is going to show through the color of the garment so we're pressing now for 385 for 70 seconds and again it's all in the instructions you can't go wrong with this process you make sure that you have all the information you need so that you have a great press all right so we're counting down we are at 7 seconds so that parchment paper is no longer any good again I press I printed this on regular copy paper so there you can see what's left and you can see this is just plain copy paper and again this is on a colored t-shirt so it's not going to be as vibrant but still absolutely gorgeous result a gun it's still a little stiff but once the first time we watch this then it's just going to feel like a regular cotton t-shirt here it is on white so you're always going to get a better result on a white or a light-colored t-shirt but I really wanted to put this to the test and see how it looked on a this is live like a fluorescent pink t-shirt I'm not sure how well it's coming through so it's kind of on the medium side as far as a darkness so I've prepped one more shirt with the dye press product and this time we're going to try the cricket in fusible ink I have cut the words be kind out of the infusible ink course it's weird and we're going to try that this is a hundred percent cotton Hanes t-shirt just a plain old t-shirt and we're going to try the cricket and fusible link with the dye press treated cotton t-shirt so let's see how this goes I've already done the two layers of the poly tee I'm gonna go ahead and put the words on we're going to cover it with our parchment paper three eighty five seventy seconds and let's see if cricket infusible ink also works on a cotton t-shirt I enjoy finding new ways to use this cricket and fusible ink I know some people are limited by the fact that you could only get the white or the gray t-shirts now that's not going to be a problem we can use cotton t-shirts in fusible link and get some really unique projects just keep in mind that just like the printer ink this is a translucent ink so the color of the shirt is going to show through the design just like it did on this but if you use a white cotton t-shirt you're going to get the more vibrant result so let's see how I did on a white t-shirt take off my parchment paper wow so here is the transfer after the ink has been lifted and here is your fusible ink on a white t-shirt I don't know if you can see the label but this is just a plain Fruit of the Loom 100% cotton t-shirt and look at that result so let's take a close-up look at some of the shirts that we made today I am so impressed by this product to be honest I thought it would work but I didn't think I would work this well and you really cannot tell that this is not a hundred percent polyester shirt everything is vibrant everything looks amazing and the transfer is solid so very very impressed I hope you

shirt agency is\ngoing to cover everything you need to know about printing on fleece by using\nthree basic types of ink plastisol water base and discharge let's go see\nhow it's done so what's the difference between printing on fleece versus Jersey\nwhat really just comes down to fluffiness so a lot of people mess up by\nnot adjusting their off contact we've raised all of our off contact so that we\ncan have a nice smooth even print off contact is just the difference between\nthe screen and the actual fabric do you want a small gap so that you can allow\nthe ink to come through and not be stuck to the fabric so you've been doing this\nfor a really long time I know you've been putting on different fabrics\nfleece jersey whatever it may be but what is your favorite thing about\nprinting on the bella canvas fleece well I mean other than the fabric just\nbeing soft and great to wear it has a really smooth surface so our inks go on\nsmoothly and we don't have any bumpiness in the texture from the weave of the\nfabric so what's the first print that we're\ngoing to do today on our 60/40 fleece well the most common ink for a hoody is\ngoing to be plastisol and so we're going to use a low bleed ink by willflex I'm\nso excited to print this first style today because this is actually our\nnewest style for fast fashion it's our women's cropped hooded fleece\nit actually has tonal draw cords and it's definitely on trend with what you\nsee in retail so I'm excited to see it printed yeah sure it's going to look\ngreat so what Vlad is going to do is he's going to load the garment onto the\nboard and we're going to do one pass of plastisol flash it and then do another\npass that's going to give us a nice bright ink so the flash units are\ngoing to be curing it for only about four to six seconds and when it's cured\nit's going to be dry to the touch so that we can do a nice secondary layer\nthat's smooth so you can see the second one has already been flash cured and now\nit's going to have a nice bright print because we have two layers\noh yeah the white and they stay nice and thin and here's file print looks awesome so\nnow we're going to move on to a water-based ink and the water-based inks\nare really nice because they kind of get into the fabric you're going to want to\ngo with a lighter color garment or you're going to put some sort of white\nbase underneath it today we're just going to be putting water base directly\nonto the fabric so it's a really nice integrated print so for the water base\nwe created this custom Pantone color and we did it with the pigment so we go in\nwe measure all the different pigments and we can get an exact Pantone match so\nyou can see it's a real thin water-based ink and I'm just going to put it above\nthe art spread it out a little so that we can start doing our first sample\nprint of it how long does it take to make these custom inks for somebody\nwho's experienced with mixing it's probably a 10 to 15 minute job per color\nbut within inexperience it it's a little rough yeah it looks and feels great I\nlove it on our peach so today we're going to print on our storm and then\nalso our heather forest so for the next inks because we're going to do some dark\ngarments we're going to do discharge and this is going to strip away the pigment\nwith this type of ink we're going to have the same feel that we had with that\nwater-based print okay it's going to be like real soft premium feel instead of\nthat thicker plastisoll which I feel like customers are gravitating towards more\njust where it feels like it's a part of the fabric because its next garments a little bit\ndarker we're going to have a little bit more of a vintage quality because the\ndischarge is made for 100% cotton but we're doing it on one of your heather\nblend the darker garments especially because of the polyester that's where\nyou'll see some difference in washing on the lighter garment the pigment holds on\na little bit better but the darker coming when you wash you'll see that's a\npolyester let go of some of your pigment so if that's why you'll get that more\nretro feel with this type of thing yes and I'm excited to see it on our heather\nforest heather's fastest growing fabrications in our industry and we\ndecided to add Heather to our fleece so this is one of our newer colors for this\nyear and the textured fabric will really make the prints pop so I'm excited to\nsee it if you guys have any questions about what cole covered in the video\ntoday please leave them in the comments below we'll also include a link to the\ncrop hooded fleece that we showed in this video today it's our newest fast\nfashion style and it's something you don't want to miss see you next time. Be Different", "xjWUT5kaalU": "- Hello, everybody. My name is Jennifer Maker. Today, we are learning how to use Cricut's print and then cut feature to make cute T-shirts with\nprintable iron-on decals on The Great Maker Show and Tell. So print and cut seems to be one of the hardest to understand features\nof Cricut Design Space. So today, I want to show you how easy print and cut really can be and de-mystify the entire process for you. There's a lot of things that we can make with the print and cut feature,\nlike stickers, wall decals, laptop and keyboard overlays,\nand even temporary tattoos. But when I asked you all\nwhat you most wanted me to teach you how to make with\nthe print and cut feature, you overwhelmingly answered, T-shirts. So what we're going to do today is use the print and then cut feature to make these printable\niron-on decals for T-shirts. The awesome thing about these is that you can make decals for\nyour shirts in full color. You're not limited by vinyl\ncolor or anything like that. The sky's the limit with these. All you need for this project is some printable iron-on\ntransfer medium like this, an inkjet printer, a\nway to press your decal, like an EasyPress or an iron,\nand something you can make with the print and then cut\nfeature in Cricut Design Space. Now, I made these cute shirts,\none black and one white, so we can compare and\nsee which one worked best with this technique. I also tried two different\nbrands of iron-on transfers, these two, and I also experimented with using the transfers for light fabric as well as those for dark fabric. Did you know that there\nare two different kinds? And yes, it actually really matters. And while I was at it, I also tried switching up the transfers\nonto the light and dark shirts. So, you know, I tried like switching them. So let's head on over\nto Cricut Design Space so I can teach you all\nabout print then cut, show you how to prepare different designs, and tell you which kinds\nof designs work best for this particular technique and which ones you might want to avoid. So Cricut Design Space has\nmany powerful features, one of which is the\nprint then cut feature. And I think many of us are\nscared of it in the beginning, but I can help you\nunderstand and use it better. So all print then cut\nis, is a way to cut out a printed image on your Cricut. And when it's set up properly, your Cricut will cut\naround the image perfectly, leaving you with a super\nprecisely cut image that you can use for your projects. So to get started, let's head on over to Cricut Design Space. And we're gonna start a\nnew project, right up here. I'm gonna replace this one here. And I want you to click on templates. So templates give you a sort of framework so that you can see your\nproject and visualize it. Scroll down and look for classic T-shirts or there's a lot of\ndifferent T-shirts in here, there's also, you have\nV-neck, a wide neck T-shirt. Let's click on this one, wide neck shirt. And at the top here, you\ncan change the color of it. I wanna change it to black. You can change it to any color that helps you visualize your shirt. So there's a black shirt. And this grid like here, which\ngets in the way in this case, I think, you can get rid of it by clicking up here in the\nupper left corner twice. Once, twice, and it goes away. So let's make this a little bigger. Okay, so here's our black shirt. Now, you need an image. I think most people want to just use images that they find online, so let me show you how to do that. Let's say I want to make a unicorn shirt. The simplest way is just to\nuse one in Cricut Design Space. So to find images, click on images over here on the left\nside, then type in a word that describes what\nyou want, like unicorn. And if you click the filter\nbutton, or link, over here, you can then check off\nprintables, right here. And it'll show you things that are designed for print then\ncut, like these unicorns. Right, so just do that, look for things, and when you find one you want, you can click on it and\nthen click insert images. So once it's on your canvas, you'll want to resize\nit to fit your shirt. It's important to note that you need to keep your print then\ncut image smaller than 6.75 inches by 9.25 inches. It doesn't matter if that's\nhigh or long or wide, it just needs to be\nwithin those dimensions. So let's center this on the shirt. Just clicking and dragging it, and then you can change\nthe size by a couple ways. There's two ways, you can\nchange the size up here or you can drag it. Dragging it is a little less precise. We can get it to under 9.25 like this, or we can just type 9.25 right here. And now we know it's the correct size. So there we go. So this looks great. Now there's a few things to double-check before we can actually make it. First, we need to find out, is it flattened into just one layer? To find out, look at the layers panel over here on the right. And we can see that this unicorn is actually made up of several layers. So to fix that, select all the layers and then click flatten at the bottom. So, to select all the layers, you can just hold down the shift key\nand click on each one, or usually, just clicking the name at the very top of the group, if it's in grouped, of\ncourse, will do that. And then you click flatten. It's not letting me\nflatten, and the reason is because it's actually only\nshowing one of these images here. So we don't actually need\nto do anything at all and let's go ahead and delete these layers that we're not even using. There we go. So now it's just one layer,\nwhich is by default flattened. But what if you can't find\nthe image that you want in Design Space? What if this isn't the\nkind of unicorn you want? So here's what you do. Go find an image that you do want to use. You should be able to\nuse an image in Google, especially if it's just\nfor your own personal use. But if you intend to sell your shirts, you'll need to obtain a commercial license from the image copyright holder. But let's say I wanna make a shirt with just a unicorn for a family member. And I'm gonna type in unicorn. See what comes up. And by the way, if you click on images, which is this link right here, it'll show you a bunch of images, right? So I see lots of unicorn images here. I like this one. I'm gonna select it. And I'm going to save the image. So I'm gonna right click on\nit and choose save image as. And I'm gonna put it\ninto my downloaded folder and I'm gonna call it unicorn balloon because it's a balloon, and save it. Now remember, personal use only, don't do this if you want to sell it. If you wanna sell it, you\nneed to get permission. All right, so let's hop back\nout over to Cricut Design Space and let's hide this unicorn. We don't need that right now. Click on upload. And then upload image, and browse. And we're gonna go find that\nimage that we just downloaded. Search by list, unicorn balloon. And we're gonna open it. And when this opens, you\nwant to click on complex. If you don't, if you do simple, it's gonna change the colors on you. This isn't what you want. For print then cut, you\nalways want complex. And then click continue. This screen here will always come up when you import an image like this. This is your chance to clean up the image. This unicorn is already\npretty clean, thankfully, but it has this big\nwhite background, right? We can get rid of that background by making sure the magic\nwand cursor is selected, which it is, it's\ndarker, and then click on the white space around the\nunicorn, just like this. Awesome, isn't that cool? And don't forget to\nlook for the inside bits that should be deleted\nas well, like right here. And you can click the preview\nbutton at the bottom here so that you can see how\nyour image will be cut out and look for any bits that you don't like. Right, so at the edges here,\nit's a little bit rough. You could fix that by going and\nclicking on your erase tool. And we can zoom in with\nthese, the cursor over here so that we're getting into, you\nknow, the spot that we want. You can change your\norientation on the screen with these sliders here. All right, and then we're\ngonna click on preview again so we can see. So this edge is a little rough. It's probably going to be fine, but if you wanna smooth that out, you can. So we can just click here, and we can get in closer if we have to. And we could smooth it out. Let's see if we improved that. Definitely improved that. So that's what you can do when\nyou need to clean up images. Which is actually really a powerful tool. So once it looks good, you can\ngo ahead and click continue. And then make sure that\nsave as print then cut image is selected here, just\nlike this, and click save. And then it will save into your files, to your images in Cricut Design Space. And then once it's uploaded,\nyou'll wanna select the image and click insert images. And then when it comes in,\nwe'll want to resize it just like we did before. So let's position this on our\nshirt so we can visualize it. And again, we wanna make sure that the smallest number is\nno bigger than 6.75. There we go. So now, this is sized properly to fit in the print then cut restrictions. We just should always double check that it is set to print then cut. And over here in the layers panel, we can see that it says cut, and then there's a\nline, and it says print. So this is properly set. But if it isn't, you\ncan always change this by going up to the line type menu here, at the top of the window,\nand make sure that it says cut in this first box and\nprint in the fill box. If it does, then you're good to go. Now, if a ready made image\nisn't going to work for you, you can design your own. There are so many ways to do that right within Cricut Design Space. For example, you can click with, actually, let's move\nour unicorn over here. You can click on shapes. And then you can choose a heart. And let's move this\nover here and resize it so that the smallest size is 6.25. Assuming you want it to be that big, of course, it can go smaller. And then go up to the fill menu, right here, and you choose print. So now this is a print then cut image. And you can see, in the\nlayers panel over here it says cut, line, print. Awesome, okay. But what if you don't want a gray heart? I mean, that's kind of boring, right? As it turns out, there's\na ton of awesome patterns right in Cricut Design\nSpace to choose from. You can pick one that you want, so we're gonna click\non this gray box here. That's the color of the heart. And we're gonna choose from\nthis drop-down menu pattern. And it gives us all of these\nreally awesome patterns. There's a ton of them in here. I mean, really, there's a ton of them. Let's just pick this red one right here. And see, it fills up the\nheart, isn't that cool? You could even edit the pattern a bit by clicking on the edit pattern link. And you can change the scale. So I can make it, I can just, using the slider will\nmake it easier for me. So I can change the\nscale and I can flip it so that that pattern is going in different directions like that. And it's really, really quite awesome. I'm gonna change it so that the pattern is sort of symmetrical like this. And close it, and then now you'll see it's reflected in your\nheart on the screen. Isn't that cool? You could do more, too. Let's say you wanna\npersonalize this heart. So click on text over on the left side. Type in a name. So I'm gonna type in Alexa. And choose the font you want. I'm gonna choose a nice, thick font. Not that one. I like Impact, we'll do Impact. Actually, no, we need\nsomething cuter than that, it's a heart. Let's see, I'm gonna do a system font so that I don't have to\nworry about its cost. Because if you don't have Cricut access or haven't bought the fonts for Cricut, then it will charge you. So you may want to use the fonts that are already installed in your system so you don't have to worry about that. This one's cute. All right, so there's the name, and I'm gonna resize the\nname so it fits in this. I'm gonna zoom in a bit here so we can see this a little better. All right, there we go, so\nI have a name in a heart. Now, if I were to just flatten\nthis right now and print it, I would get a black text in a heart. But what if I want whatever\ncolor this shirt is to be able to see through, so that you could see\nthrough this, the text? So if this was, say, a\npink or purple shirt, the letters would be whatever color it is and then we can do that. So all we need to do is select both the heart and the text, like this. And you can tell over\nhere in the layers panel that I've selected both because\nthey're both highlighted. And then come down to\nslice and click that. And what happens is, the letters get sliced out of the heart. So if we click and drag this heart aside, we can see that the\nletters are left there. And we can then delete the\ntwo layers that are left over. Which, by the way, this\nis also super cute. But we can remove that,\nand then we just have this. And then if we were to change\nthe color of our shirt, which I'll do right now by clicking on the template down here, and we changed it to\npurple, you can see now that the color of the shirt will show through. So it's really, actually, a\ngreat way to really simply personalize a print then\ncut image for a shirt. But here's another really fun way to make a personalized design for a T-shirt with print then cut. So go find an image that you like. I've already done it and imported\none, so let's upload this. So this tool image here, I found this, and I added it already\nto Cricut Design Space. So here it is, let's move\nthe heart out of the way. And we're gonna change\nour T-shirt back to black. Okay, so here is our image. Now, let's resize this\nimage so we know it fits. So we need the shortest\ndimension to be under, either 6.75 or under. So there we go. Oops, no, now the width is too high. That was the wrong one, 6.75, there we go. So this is now sized correctly. Now what we can do is\ngo on over to the side and click on text again, and\nwe're gonna type another name. I'm gonna type Mr. Maker\nand we're gonna choose a nice, big, bold font like Impact. So, search for Impact, there we go. And I'm going to make this bigger and position it over my image. And it doesn't fit. I'm going to use letter\nspacing to bring it in. For this technique, we want the letters to be pretty close together. Let me bring, open this\nup a little bit more so you can see better what I'm doing. So once it's, the letters\nare pretty close together, we can widen it so it's\ntaking up most of the picture. So like this. And then position it\nwhere you want, right, because we're going to do\nthe slice feature again. So you select that text and the image, just the two layers, and you click slice. So this time, we delete\nthe background image and we delete the black\nletters, and we get this. Isn't that, like, super cool? I can think of a lot of people\nwho would love this shirt. And it's perfect for print then cut because you can't\nreplicate this with vinyl. You need to be able to\nprint something like that. So that's how you do that. And of course, you can get even fancier than that if you want. So I did something like\nthat with the decal that I put on my own\nshirts, the Miss Maker decal that I showed you earlier in this video. So to make it, I found\nsome artwork that I liked over at Design Bundles. So let me show you where that is. So this is DesignBundles.net. And they have, in addition to having things that you can purchase, they also have some free designs. So I just came in here and\nI searched on watercolor. And these free designs came up, the watercolor flower and bird set, and the watercolors down here, the watercolor craft collection. Of course, these are free at\nthe time I'm doing the video. This could change, but\neven if they aren't free, their stuff is awesome\nand it's worth the price. So these are free elements\nand I'm gonna use these. And I've already downloaded them, so, but let me show you how to upload them. And I'm gonna go back over\nto Cricut Design Space and we're going to just\nhide Mr. Maker for now. Make this a little bit smaller so we can see our shirt\na little bit better. Okay, so we go to upload,\nupload image, browse. And then we're gonna go find those designs that we downloaded. And I've already picked out, they have many elements in that. For example, here's the\nflowers and birds set. There's tons of stuff\nin here, it's amazing. But there's a wreath in\nparticular that I want. If you're on a Mac and you want to see what these things look\nlike before you upload them, you can click at this\nlittle icon over here and choose columns. And then when you click on them, it actually will give you a preview, so that's really useful. I'm sure there's a way\nto do that on PC as well, I just don't happen to know what it is. So, there's a wreath here\nthat I really want to use. It's this one. Okay, now notice that\nthere's a JPEG version of it and a PNG version of it. You want the PNG version because then you won't have to clean\nit up the same way. It won't have that big, white background, it'll have a transparent background. So get that PNG and click open. And it's a big file, so you'll\nneed to give a little time. Again, click on complex\nand click continue. And we can resize this so we can see it, we can resize our screen so we can see the whole thing in there. So here it is, isn't it pretty? And of course, you can do\ncleanup on this as well. You could remove elements\nthat you don't want. You'll see, it's already\ngot a transparent background so it's already good to go. I do want to remove the\nleaves at the bottom. We can do that by clicking\non the erase tool over here. And zoom in so that we\ncan see those really well. So here they are. And then the erase tool,\nyou can move the slider to have a different size\ncursor eraser, tool, whatever. So it will go faster if you use this tool. And you can just go right\naround the edges of things. You probably don't have to be\nperfect, you're just looking, and this is gonna be a fairly small design once it's actually printed. But I just want these\nlittle leaves to go away because when we do print then cut images, we want to be careful of a lot, I mean, I just don't want these little fiddly bits that I'm gonna have to\nworry too much about them being hard to pull\noff my mat and stuff and I don't need them here. So I've chosen to remove them. You can do whatever you'd like. But when we do print then cut, you know, simpler can, at least for\nthe cut part, can be easier. And I'm gonna talk a\nlittle bit more about that and show you what I mean by that later. Because, you know, there's some things that work great for print\nthen cut for a T-shirt and other things that are just gonna be more work than it's worth. The cool thing, of course,\nis that it's gonna cut right around all of these flowers and all the leaves at the top. So that is huge, because\nI can't even imagine doing this with a pair of scissors. I mean, I guess I could do it, but man, that would take a long time. Okay, now check out, click\non preview down at the bottom to make sure that you don't have any little bits left on the canvas. This looks good over here. Sometimes there'll be like\na little edge or something that you forgot to erase,\nbut that looks good. So go ahead and click continue. Down at the bottom. Again, be patient because\nsometimes it just takes a while for Cricut to bring in\nthe file and render it. So make sure save as print\nthen cut image is selected and click save. Again, this can take some time, depending on how complex your image is. So just be patient and don't assume that, you know, it's stuck. This bar at the top you see that's, this green bar here that's\nsliding along the top, that's your indication\nthat it's still working and you should just hang in there. That it's, that your\ncomputer hasn't frozen or anything like that. All right, so there we go,\nit has uploaded successfully. So we're gonna click on the\nimage and click insert images. And again, if it's a complex image, you just need to be patient\nwhile it brings it in. So there it is, and it's pretty big, so we need to resize it. Again, make sure the shortest side, or the longest side, is within 6.25. Or sorry, 6.75, I keep\ngetting those wrong. This one is the longer, so there we go. So now this is the proper size. And we'll put it on our shirt like this. So I mean, this is cute and\nall, but I want more than this. This morning, I created\nsome brush lettering, calligraphy script, and I'm\ngoing to place that on here. So I'm going to upload that. Now, if you would like to use that, I have made it available on\nmy blog at jennifermaker.com, and you're welcome to use it. So here it is, Miss Maker. And I'm going to select\nthat and put it in. And let's change the\ncolor of that right now because that's not gonna\nshow up on a black shirt. Okay, I want a teal color. Similar to, I want it to match. There we go, that looks fine. Okay, so, and we can drag\nthis into the center here. Just click and drag. And use the resize icon in the corner to make it fit as you want. All right, and then I\nthought it would be fun, zoom in a little bit more,\nI thought it would be fun to personalize this further by adding some crafty\ntools and stuff to it. So I already uploaded those. So I have things like this glue tube, at least that's what I\nthink it is, is a glue tube. And it'll come in pretty big. And these are part of the craft,\nwatercolor craft collection that I downloaded from Design Bundles. So we're just gonna resize that so it's about the size I want. And come on over here and rotate\nit and put it on my wreath. Just like this. So let's get the pencil\nand do the same thing. And I will speed this up a bit while I put on all of\nmy little crafty things. (upbeat music) There we go. So this is awesome, I really like this, but there are some inherent issues here. Just like I was talking about\nwith all the little leaves, we've also got this text\njust sort of floating here. And there's like a M-S,\nwhich is connected, but then there's a little\nperiod, and then there's Maker. So three things, plus the wreath. And when we cut this out,\nthey're going to be loose and we'll have to reposition them. And we'll have to worry about them being straight and all that. So I am going to make it\nso much easier on myself and I am going to add a background. So I'm gonna click on\nshapes over here on the left and make a circle. Then I'm gonna change the\ncircle right away to white. There we go. Now, I'm gonna put this behind this design so that it eliminates\nall the floating bits. And so I'm gonna go up to arrange and I'm gonna do send to back. So now it's behind my design. And I'm gonna use the\nresize icon to make it so that it's just a little\nbit smaller than my wreath. Oops, I didn't mean to do that. Let's click the undo button. So like this. Just a little smaller than my wreath. And the advantage to doing that is so now all of this here\nis gonna be all together and there's still little bits of leaves, but they're really\nconnected to the circle. I don't have to rely\nupon these really tiny little fragile-looking stems, because those might break\nwhen I go to cut them or pull them off the mat. We're almost done and we're\nalmost ready to make this. But there's an issue. So, if I were to make this right now, it would be all layers. I'll show you what I mean. So I'm gonna click make it. And just ignore the unicorn. But what would happen right now is, you'd get just the wreath,\nand just the circle, and just the letters. This isn't gonna work,\nthis isn't what we want. So let's cancel that. What we need to do is,\nhide our grid again, what we need to do is flatten our design. Now that we've created\nthis awesome design, we need to flatten it. So we're gonna just click\nand drag a selection box around the design, just like this. And then we just go over here\nto the bottom layers panel and we click flatten. And that is it. Now, if you look over in the layers panel, you see that that image\nsays cut and print. And that's exactly what we\nwant and this is ready to go. Double check that your sizing is correct, that it's within 6.75 and 9.25. And this could go a little bigger, so we'll move this up to 6.75 like this. Well, I moved it down,\nI guess, a bit, not up. But there we go, this will\nnow fit within the size. In fact, let me show you what would happen if it was too big. So right now, it's just a touch too big. If we were to click make it right now, we would get an error message. And the error message\nsays, image too large, at least one of your printable\nimages is too large to print. Please reduce size to\nless than 9.25 by 6.75. And we can click this to dismiss it. So we're going to fix that\nby just clicking on it and fixing the size. So we're gonna make sure this is 6.75. And it resizes for us. And as long as this lock icon is set to lock and not unlocked, it will resize it proportionately. Now, if we click make it,\nwe don't get the error. There it is, there's our design. And you can see that it's ready to go. So this is the mat preview area. And it's very important to\nnote this black box around it. You want this black box to be here. This is an important\npart of print then cut. Without this black box, Cricut won't know where to calibrate itself\nand where to cut out. And it could cut it out all wonky. So this is important. So this is exactly what we want to see. When you have the sizing right and everything looks good\non your mat preview screen, go ahead and click continue. Just like that. Now we get to this page, which is, as you already know,\nour print and cut page. But things change a little bit here depending on whether you're using the transfer medium for\nlight-colored fabrics or the medium for dark-colored fabrics. Because they come in two\ndifferent variations, remember. Now, if you're cutting on the\nlight-colored transfer medium, and you can tell by\nlooking at your package, all right, if you're not sure, if you're doing the\nlight-colored transfer medium, you need to mirror your image. So to do that, click on the edit link over here on the right. And you get this little screen, and at the bottom here,\nmake sure mirror is toggled. Just like this. And then click done. So that's what you wanna\ndo when you're using the light-colored transfer medium. If you're cutting on the\ndark-colored transfer medium, do not mirror your image. But let's do our white-colored\ntransfer medium first and we're gonna leave it mirrored. Now we need to print our\ndesign on the transfer medium. So click send to printer and make sure this add bleed option is\non, that's really important. Because the bleed function will add a little border around your image so that you don't have a white outline. It'll actually kind of\nextend the image that's there just a little bit,\nbleeding it, essentially. So I also recommend that\nyou click advanced options, right here, and make sure that your paper type is set\nto the appropriate thing. And it's gonna depend on, your printer's gonna have its own options. So my printer doesn't have, so it's under media and quality for me. And this screen might look\na little different for you, so you might wanna click around. But you're looking for\nyour paper quality first. So paper type, these are my options. I don't have a lot of options. I would either go with\nspecialty paper, matte, or plain paper. So I'll pick specialty paper, matte. If you have an option for transfer medium, iron-on transfer, use that. And then you also wanna\nlook for the quality. So if we just leave it at normal, it might not be as vibrant as you want, there might be banding, which\nare those horizontal lines that you'll sometimes\nsee on an inkjet printer. But if you slide this all the way over, and sometimes this is a\ndrop-down menu instead, for high quality or best\nquality or something like that. You want it the highest quality possible so that you get those\nnice, rich, vibrant colors. So check your paper and check your quality and then you can click print. And it will send it to your printer. So let's go on over\nthere so I can show you how to load your printer and\nget it printed correctly. It's also really important to note that you need to use an inkjet printer for this iron-on transfer technique. A laser printer won't work for this. Inkjet only. So we want to print on our\niron-on transfer sheet. So look at what I have. I have this Jolee's brand, which is for light and dark fabrics, so there's actually\nfive sheets of each kind in this package. And I also got the Silhouette brand of printable heat transfer medium. And again, I have one for\nlight and one for dark. So make sure you know which one you have so that you can follow the\nright method in this video. So let's go print out the\nlight transfer right now. All right, so, on the back\nof the transfer sheet, there are the lines. So that is your back and you wanna print on the front of your sheet. So here's my inkjet\nprinter and I'm going to make sure that I load this in the printer so that it'll print on the right side. Okay, so you need to know\nwhich way your printer prints, on what side of it. You might wanna do a test print first. So get that loaded in there and print it and then it will be time for us to cut it. So now once the transfer\nmedium is printed, you need to come back over\nhere to the Cricut Design Space and set it up for cutting. So click on browse all materials and search on printable iron-on. You'll get two options. So we're doing the light one right now, so we wanna click light and click done. And I always set my pressure to more. And let's go ahead and cut this out. All right, so just place\nyour printed transfer sheet in the upper left corner\nof your cutting mat. Do your best to get it\nas straight as you can, but the good thing is\nthat it's the black lines on your sheet that are going to tell the Cricut where to cut. So what's going to happen is,\nyou're going to load it in and then a little light is gonna come on and it's going to start\nsearching for those black lines. And your Cricut will\ncheck the placement of all of those black lines\nbefore it starts cutting. And that's how it can create a beautiful and really precisely done cut. Now, it's important that\nyou're using white paper when you do print then cut and that you're in a well-lighted room. If it's too dark, it might find it hard to see those black lines. So here is our iron-on transfer\nfor light-colored fabric. And we need to talk about\nthe proper way to weed this. First, the wrong way. Do not peel the decal off the backing. When you're using the\nlight-colored transfer medium, you need to keep the backing in place and remove all the other parts\nyou do not wish to transfer. So here is the right way\nto weed an iron-on transfer for light-colored fabric. Simply remove the material\naround your decal. Okay, let's apply our\ndecal onto our white shirt. So this is 100% cotton shirt. And I'm gonna fold it in\nhalf like this and iron it and then I can see exactly\nwhere the center line is so I can put my decal on. Now, for this decal, you wanna put it on with the backing up. You're gonna iron on the backing, that's why we kept that backing in place. So you can see those lines there that reassure us that\nyou've got the backing up. I'm using my EasyPress at 300 degrees. And the instructions actually say that you need to do it for 90 to 120 seconds. So that is indeed what I have done. So it takes a little\nwhile, and you'll see me keep pressing the button so I can do this. I want, and my EasyPress\ndoesn't quite cover the entire decal, so I'm\nmoving it around slowly, even though this video is sped up. And you need to peel it off when it's, right after you do it. You do not want to wait at all. So this is what happens\nthe first time I did it. It does not look good at all. I thought maybe I waited\na little bit too long after ironing it, so I did it again. So I cut out another piece\nand I ironed it on again using the instructions\nthat came with the package. Peeled it off immediately, and the transfer was definitely darker, but still really not as\nvibrant as I would have liked. All right, so now let's try doing this with a fabric transfer intended\nfor dark-colored fabrics. All right, so we need to go\nback to Cricut Design Space and get this set up for the other kind of fabric transfer medium, the\none intended for dark fabrics. So to do that, we need to\nmake sure mirror is off. And you probably, if you're\ndoing this from scratch, you didn't turn it on,\nbut let's say you did. Click the edit button right there and make sure that mirror is set to off. The little toggle at the\nbottom, and then click done. And so once the mirror's\noff, and we also need to change our material from\nprintable iron-on light to printable iron-on dark. And those are the major changes, as far as Cricut Design Space goes, for cutting on the transfer\nintended for dark fabric. Now let me show you how\nto actually print it. All right, so just like before,\nwe need to make sure that we're printing on the\nright side of the paper. Here's our dark fabric medium. Look where those lines\nare and make sure that you're putting your\npaper into your printer so that it will print on\nthe side without lines. That's the side that you want to print on. All right, so once your\nproject is printed, it's time to cut it out. So place it on your mat in\nthe upper left-hand corner. Again, try to get it as\nstraight as possible, no wrinkles, super smooth,\ndo it in a well-lighted room. Also check to make sure there's\nno weird marks on your mat or smudges or anything like that, anything that could\nconfuse the sensor marks and the sensor on the Cricut. If you continue to have any\nproblems with print then cut, there's a whole list of\ntroubleshooting ideas over on the cricut.com website. And I will put the link to\nthe troubleshooting sheet in the tutorial on my blog. But again, what's going to happen is it's going to look, the\nsensor's going to look, turn on this light and\nlook for the black box that's around your image. And once it finds that and\nknows where to cut, it cuts it. All right, so once your\ndecal is printed and cut, it's time to weed it. So what you wanna do in\nthis case is actually peel it up off of the backing. So it's different than\nthe way that you do it with the light-colored transfer sheets. The stuff that's for dark-colored sheets will actually have the\nsurface come with it, instead of transferring it\nfrom this onto the shirt. The whole thing, so anything\nthat's white stays white, which is actually really awesome, and that's why they say it's\nfor dark-colored shirts. So you're just gonna, you know, if you have a design like\nmine, just go carefully. I didn't have any serious\nissues with tearing or ripping, but still, wouldn't want to\nlose any of my little leaves. So I used my weeding\ntool to make sure that each one was up and off of the backing and remove the whole decal. And there we go, that's\nwhat it looks like, looks just like what we designed. All right, so I'm gonna do the same thing, fold my shirt in half and iron it so that I can see where the center is. And then I'm gonna place\nthe decal on top of it, making sure that this\nflower at the top and bottom line up with that center line. Also note where I'm placing it. I'm not placing it in the\ndead center of the shirt. I'm placing it close to the neckline because that's where we\nwear our decals, right? And again, I'm gonna follow\nthe directions for doing this. I set my EasyPress to 300\ndegrees for 30 seconds. And I checked it and it was\nactually really looking great. So, but the top edges were not quite, you know, adhered down. Most probably because the\nEasyPress had missed it. So I did it for another 30 seconds to make sure that\neverything was pressed down. And that was sufficient. I did not have to do any more than that. And I think it's a good idea\nnot to do any more than that because you don't wanna burn the material, which is a possibility. So there we go, it looks great. Now, I wondered, what would happen if I printed my decal onto the transfer intended for the dark-colored fabrics, but put it on a white shirt. I wanted to see if that would improve the, you know, how it looked, because I really, really\nwas not happy at all with the way that it transferred before. So that's what I did. I cut out the decal again\nand I pressed this, again, at 300 degrees for 30 seconds, and I, you know, I did it twice so that I was making sure that I was\ncovering the entire image. And by the way, this is a great tip. So if you have the smaller EasyPress, you just do this, it's fine. You don't really need the bigger one if you're willing to\ntake a little extra time. And there we go, which, by\nthe way, turned out amazing. So let's compare it\nwith the one that I did using the other method. Look, huge difference here, guys. Like, I have, like, really,\nit's turned out really beautiful and as far as I'm concerned,\nfrom this point forward, I will be using the transfer\nmedium for dark-colored fabrics even if it's a white shirt. And that's what I'm gonna\nrecommend for you as well. Because it looks so much more vibrant, it's smooth, it's beautiful, everything. Now you might be wondering if I noticed any difference in the\nquality between using the Jolee's brand printable\nheat transfer medium and the Silhouette brand. And in fact, I did not. They were pretty much identical. And my understanding is that the Avery is also a really good brand. So I think, in fact, they\nall kind of seem the same, to be perfectly honest. So there was no difference in\nquality between the brands, just a difference in quality between the types for light versus dark fabric. So as you can see, there\nwas really a huge difference between the transfers intended\nfor light-colored shirts, like these, and those\nfor dark-colored fabrics. Not only do you cut and\nweed them differently, but they look way different\non the shirts, too. So this is a white shirt that's made with the light-colored transfers, right? It's washed out and it's rough. This is a white shirt made with a transfer that's intended for dark-colored shirts. It's vibrant and smooth. Big difference, right? So my recommendation is only\nuse the dark fabric transfers, even on white shirts. You'll be much happier with the results and you won't have to\nworry about mirroring when you use that kind\nof transfer, either. So much easier, really. Now, it's important that you follow the manufacturer's directions for washing these iron-on transfer shirts. Check the instructions that\ncame with your packaging. It's usually like in the back, inside. For example, you'll probably want to wait at least 24 hours before washing. And then when you do wash it,\nbe sure to turn it inside out and wash it in cold water. It's also important to\nhave a full spin cycle so your T-shirt is not\nleft soaking in water, as that will definitely affect the decal. And if you ever iron your T-shirt, make sure that you turn it inside out. Never iron it with the side, the decal, because that would be a giant mess. All in all, this project is really easy once you know which things\nto use and which to avoid. The link to the exact materials\nI used for this project, including the transfers\nand shirts and everything, is included below the video. If you have any questions\nabout this project, please leave me a comment below or post over in my awesome Facebook group at jennifermaker.com/cricutcrafters. Now, I've mentioned that\nyou can use print then cut for other things, like stickers,\nusing self-adhesive paper, like keyboard overlays and laptop decals, using self-adhesive vinyl,\nand like faux tattoos, temporary tattoos, using\nspecial transfer paper. If you'd like tutorials\non any of these projects, leave me a comment below. And that's it for today. Remember, if you can tell\nme what you want to make, I can show you how to make it. Until next time! (upbeat music)", "gqVEtRAV4jc": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel so this is the first ever walmart haul i've ever done i just typically am so overwhelmed by walmart's app and also their website that i personally have historically found it very difficult to search for clothing but if you guys are familiar with my channel you know i'm in the process of flipping all synthetics out of my closet in favor of natural fibers namely 100 cotton clothing which can be very very tough to find at a reasonable price which is why i was like literally losing my mind when i heard that they came out with a new label called free assembly and not only are all of these clothes here cotton 100 cotton some of them are even organic cotton like to think that you can get organic cotton clothing at walmart prices like i am in heaven so the first thing i grabbed for the spring summer season was this darling little top here you guys oh my gosh this yellow gingham is so sweet love the little puff sleeve and then it has this darling ruffle detail on the sleeve it is so adorable it's got a nice little flow factor to it definitely runs big so i size down to an extra small it fit perfectly it's just the sweetest little top for the warmer months and i love the fact that you can not only wear this on the shoulder but if you want to you can also like take it off the shoulder too for a really breezy vibe i love tops like this like you can easily wear this with a pair of jeans a white denim skirt white shorts like whatever you want it's just so sweet for the summer months okay so the next thing i found amongst this collection was this shirt dress here and i have to say like historically i don't really work well with shirt dresses i don't find them to be particularly flattering on my body type but i love this and now this definitely runs way big so this is a small i totally need to size down to an extra small it is a beautifully breezy cotton fabrication you guys this even has a lining along the skirt that is also cotton sometimes what i find is that labels and designers cop out on a cotton dress and add a polyester lining which drives me crazy so i was so impressed to see that they went with a cotton lining for this one of course it does have the buttons that are functional entirely down the bodice and all the way down to the end of the skirt depending on how tall you are this is either going to be a midi or a maxi length now one word to the wise this is extremely see-through on the bodice area i'm not quite sure why they went with a gorgeous lining on the skirt and then kind of just forgot about it for the top because this is very sheer in fact i initially tried it on without a cami and was like whoa even with a nude colored bra you could totally see everything so i just went with a nude cami underneath much better this is such a breezy beautiful option this yellow color is so perfect for the spring summer season i cannot wait to get this in an extra small i love this dress so when it came to bottoms one of the things i was intrigued by were their midi length denim skirts which aren't always easy to find so i grabbed it in this gorgeous white tone it's almost like a bone color but this is so beautiful and guys what i love about this cut and the silhouette is how flattering it is namely because since they went with a longer pocket it actually creates like a slight flare at the hips which is super flattering because it makes your waist look really really tiny it's a very interesting effect again it is a midi length and this is such a substantial cotton skirt you guys like you know a lot of times white denim can be like really thin very see-through this is so thick but very comfortable not see-through whatsoever it's got the functional pockets on the back it's just absolutely beautiful so this next top here is basically another version of that yellow gingham i showed you at the beginning i wanted to get it in just a plain white because i have an obsession with wearing white tops with jeans in the warmer months just because i think it is so fresh looking now one thing i wanted to point out in terms of the detail that went into these tops so again not only are all these clothes cotton organic cotton like they did not cut corners even like the little like strings that are used to hold it on a hanger you know typically these are plastic these are cloth like what a great attention to detail and again from a brand that you find at walmart much like that yellow gingham top again with the puff sleeve the sweet little ruffling on the end of the cuff there and it just has such a darling little flow to it this actually is almost like a seersucker cotton it's so darling on i love these tops so continuing with my obsession with white tops and the warmer months i also grabbed this you guys like again walmart feminine details beautiful walmart like i cannot get over this this is such a sweet top with the ruffled collar i found that while it is high it's not annoyingly high it's actually really comfortable love that crochet detailing right along the collarbone and it does have a proper cuff with buttons that do have a slight puff to them you guys this is such a flattering top it does have the keyhole design in the back with a little button at the nape of the neck just absolutely beautiful fit and it is true to size so one of the big trends we're seeing are shirt jackets and i just personally am normally not drawn to them whatsoever i find that they're just oversized they're sloppy looking they're not flattering but i saw this one and what i love about this jacket is while it is a shirt jacket it is not crazy obnoxious oversized it's not sloppy looking it has like a very tailored again expensive look to it which is perfect when you're trying to look expensive on a budget now this is like more of like an ivory shade so it's not a stark white but again the detail of this jacket 100 cotton it feels so good on it has the perfect weight to it and also i love the fact that they went with the tortoise shell buttons just such a beautiful touch this is just the perfect coat again to get that elevated casual vibe so now when it comes to tops as you probably already noticed i'm a sucker when it comes to those feminine details that aren't like obnoxiously so like i love a puff sleeve i love a well-placed ruffle and so when i saw this knit top i literally like jumped on it because number one i'm so attracted to this periwinkle color it is absolutely beautiful and again just love the puff sleeve that's almost like a minimal puff sleeve nothing like obnoxious or crazy and again with those details love the fact that they went with almost a three-quarter length sleeve but then they added this extra substantial cuff to it to give the sleeve some volume this is so comfortable on it's a beautiful cotton fabrication again just a classic top that is so easy to dress up or down like literally tops like this i wear the heck out of because you can style them in so many different ways you can wear them with a skirt you can wear them with jeans you can even wear them with a cute pair of shorts and like a straw hat on a cool summer day so just love love love this style in fact i think i want to go back on the website to see what other colors they have because i love this style so much and finally rounding out this video i do have a couple more bottoms including two pairs of jeans now they did offer a super high-rise skinny which i pounced on mainly because look at this rinse you guys this is so perfect for the spring and summer season and what i totally appreciate other than the super high rise which is so flattering is the fact that the rinse itself has no like crazy whiskering on it it's this beautifully saturated blue all the way down to that clean hem you guys know i tend to hate like scissor hems unfinished hands this is such a classic now unfortunately these are slightly too long for me they're probably like a 29 in seam and i really need a 27 not sure if they sell these in a petite or not i'll have to go back onto the website but again there's no distressing whatsoever it's just a beautiful classic skinny jean now these are primarily cotton there is a touch just a touch of spandex in this to give them a super nice fit one of the things too i love about these jeans not only are they cotton but they also were really conscientious about how they constructed them the tag says the closed-loop water recycling allows us to treat 100 percent of the water used in making our jeans 85 of the water is recycled and reused saving up to half a million gallons per day i love that and another pair of jeans which i had to get was this retro flare you guys i am all about the flared jeans i have always loved flared jeans and literally like a couple weeks ago i was like oh i want to find like a lighter rinse with front pockets to really get like those boho 70 vibes and guess where they show up walmart it was so good these are also a high rise these have such a great fit to them and again that clean hem with the thicker cuff which i think is such a sweet touch these have like the perfect flare to them there's no distressing i love the extra wide pockets in the back love love love the fit of these i did go with my usual size four and they fit like a glove but much like that skinny pair again look at how beautiful of a rinse this is there's no crazy whiskering across the thighs or on the back or shimmying down the thighs towards the knee it's just completely uniform and that is so hard to find on a pair of jeans especially at a price point like this okay guys and finally they had a pair of cotton joggers which i thought would be like a sweatpant but these are actually like pants you would wear out in public and they are cute they are a little voluminous like in the hip area so i'm not sure if i'm gonna keep keep them but they're super comfortable on and they do have just like a traditional cuff it's not like you know cinched at the bottom like a sweatpant typically is so clearly these are meant to be worn out and about again for that elevated casual vibe the elastic waistband with that drawstring allows you to get the perfect cinch it does have one pocket in the back these are literally like throw on and go i love to wear pants like this with something just as simple as like a white tank top sometimes i'll throw on a denim jacket and you are out the door and they do have functional pockets as well they're just a really nicely constructed pair of pants okay guys so that is it for my first ever walmart clothing haul and again like i'm so impressed with the quality of these clothes like literally normally when you find cotton clothing and most especially organic cotton clothing the price points are three four sometimes five times as much as what we're seeing here so definitely let me know in the comments down below like have you checked out free assembly what do you think about this line i am going to be honing in on their website to see what else they come out with because i am just again so impressed everything i showed you today will be linked down below but in any event thank you guys so much for spending your time with me today i hope you're having a good one and i'll

"[Music] hello guys and welcome to our second tutorial this time I will show you how to do t-shirt printing at home using your ordinary flat iron I receive a call from a friend a week ago and he's asking me if he could use a flat iron in t-shirt printing and I said yes as long as for personal use only if it's for business I will recommend to buy a proper heat press to save more time in transferring the design so without any further ado let's start our procedure first we need to create our design let's open our Adobe Illustrator and open the piles which I have downloaded earlier and make it personalized let's make a new canvas by selecting a pore size 21 centimeter weed and 29.7 centimeter for the height change the unit is centimeter and choose CMYK as a polar mode raster effect should be set to 300 PPI it is more easier to create a design nowadays because of the Internet you just need to search in Google or Pinterest to get some design ideas there are even websites that are offering free designs like free vidcom or big TV sitcom I'm normally using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator in designing because it is more user friendly than other software in the market these are the parts that I have downloaded earlier I'd suggest that you measure the shirt printing area PERTs so you'll be able to adapt the size as per the requirements [Music] let's copy the text and paste it on the main design check thoroughly the past because there are times that some images are having some issues like this one the colors are misaligned [Music] to make it more personalized let's put the name like which boy change the font and the color to match the design you can also resize it if it's necessary I put a white background to emphasize with a boy however you can also have your own preference we will be cutting the design manually hence it is needed to put a stroke or a line at least 1 millimeter or 2 millimeter offset path set the stroke to at least 5 pixel and grayish color this will be our guide during our cutting process [Music] it seems that everything is set so let's wind it now as I standard procedure in finding make sure to select the proper printer especially if you have two or more printers installed in your computer change the document size to a pore size and select plain paper as your paper type as I have mentioned in my previous tutorial paper type depends on how you calibrate at your individual computer then select highest quality since we're using a sticker paper we don't need to reverse our image before printing it out then finally press the print button you [Music] [Music] make sure to cut the designs by following the team grey line otherwise it will be also transferred on the sure to impress [Music] you can use this or cutter as for me I prefer to use cutter emergency sirs it is easy for me to control it enter boy the jagged cap outs cross-species source if you're going to use a cutter as much as possible try to cut it lightly so the blade will not cut the back of the sticker just like this one [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] everything is done so it's time to transfer this to our t-shirt let's try to map the design toward t-shirt to make sure that it will fit actually this should be done earlier before we cut it seems okay so let's start the class where this undershirt let's remove the mat and change it with a thicker fabric or towel to support the shirt set the flat iron the maximum heat and make sure to remove the steam options otherwise it will ruin our sticker iron a towel to make sure that this flap and this sure to remove the moist of the shirt [Music] [Music] put at least three centimeter gap between the neckline in the design make sure that is in the center of the shirt use an extra plain white paper or any fabric to protect the sticker to touch directly your flat iron hold for a couple of seconds while I'm using the design to melted this event a strap earlier in your shirt remove the paper and check if the design is pasted properly check the edges to make sure that all the edges are platen properly on the shirt then iron it once again for the final patch [Music] now we're done with our personalized shirt [Music] I hope you enjoy watching and learn something new in this tutorial before leaving this like subscribe and follow this feature for our upcoming tutorials

channel for those of you who are returning visitors welcome back and for those of you who are watching for the first time welcome and i hope you stick around so today we are going to be sublimating a black shirt and it's also 100 cotton okay so we know that for sublimation you need 100 polyester and you also need a light colored shirt okay so when people say that you're sublimating on black shirts or cotton shirts it's not 100 percent accurate okay so what you are actually doing is sublimating onto something else or another product and then you're literally pressing the shirt so today what we're going to be doing is we are going to sublimate onto this paper now this just looks like regular vinyl but it is actually easy subli vinyl that is made by caesar and we are going to actually print onto this paper and then we are going to press it onto the shirt okay let's get started all right y'all so now we're in illustrator and i've already designed the image that i want to place on the shirt um i simply found this apple online by doing a regular search for a an apple a teacher apple png file and it came up it was free and i simply just input um the pattern that i wanted to use inside of each letter okay so we're going to get ready to print and let's go look at our settings it looks like this is a little off there we go all right so you always just want to make sure that your print settings are accurate or onto the correct paper and this comes just with testing honestly because everybody's printer is a little bit different we're all printing from different computers different models so you do have to do a little testing um to make sure that you get the right settings for your needs i just want to go into the print settings and i'm printing on premium presentation matte and remember we are printing directly onto the easy subway paper okay and we have it's going to print high quality i am using borderless printing because my image is a little bit large and i don't want any of it to cut off and what's also important is that when you are printing directly onto the easy subli vinyl you cannot mirror your image so usually with sublimation we're always image we're all always mirroring our images but when you're printing directly onto the easy sublet paper you do not want to mirror your image and i am going to look at my color options and it's perfect so this is exactly what i want to happen okay so we are going to get ready to print are y'all so now that we are about to print our image we need to make sure that we are inputting the easy subli into our printer the correct way okay so on the easy subway there's a side that is a little bit rough it's more matte i don't know if you guys can see it pretty well there and then when you flip it over you have a shiny side okay that shiny side is just the backing okay so if you print anything on the shiny side it will not be able to go onto the shirt you have to print it on the matte side okay this side with the matte finish and you will be able to feel the difference so don't um worry okay and you can also see the shiny side has a glare so we're going to print it on this side once we print it um we are going to weed it and then we will well we're not weeding we're cutting if we were printing it on our or if we were cutting it with the print then cut setting on a cricut machine or another vinyl cutter then you'll read it but we are actually going to cut around our image okay so remember make sure that you're printing on to the matte side all right guys so we all right so we are going to just get any lint off of our shirt and we will be pressing the shirt just to loosen it up a bit to get out any moisture for about five seconds all right guys so the image is printed onto the easy subway and it is still wet so what you want to make sure that you do is just stick it let it dry or stick it under your heat press and let that heat just get onto the image for about three to four minutes two to five minutes and then you will be able to cut it out and place it onto your shirt okay so i let it bake a little bit and we are now ready to cut it out um sometimes if you do the print then cut setting you just put this in your cricut and it will cut it um but we did it this way today so i'm just going to cut it out and i love doing um teacher shirts for myself because my kids love when i wear them and when they have like positive sayings or if i say something about them they love to um see my shirts and read them and i also made it a little bit easier for me because i made the letters touch like i made everything touch so it's a little bit easier for me so it's going to be one piece so i don't have to worry about like placing it correctly or it being uneven that's kind of why i did it that way or that is why and i see some lines in my print but it's okay i'm just gonna cut this and then i will see you at the heat press so we're all done with cutting out our image and i tried to cut out as much of the white from around the image as possible because i didn't want any of the white to really show once we press it okay so on the back side remember that shiny side that i showed you before we are going to just peel that backing away okay and so i just want to try to snatch it off and just be careful it's a little delicate you want to peel you want to be a little careful you'll feel it's pretty tough but you just want to make sure that you do not rip the vinyl okay so we've removed all of the backing from our image and so we are just going to place the image onto the shirt [Music] and just like with any other image you want to make sure that you are leaving enough space at the top and it's pretty standard to have your image start at the three inch mark from the neckline okay so we are going to just measure i usually take out my measuring tape just to make sure and that's kind of low so we can bring it up a little bit so it looks like that leaf is right there at the three inch mark okay and let's make sure the sides are a little bit we'll move it over just a tad all right guys so we are going to press this onto our shirt for 15 seconds our heat press is at 315 degrees all right so you can make sure that you put your butcher paper down because you don't want this ink to go onto the top plate all right you can just peel a little bit and look how nice remember we started out it was dull um and now look how bright that apple is that's why i did the apple in a different shade of red like a little more brighter so that you can see the difference but look how nice and bright that apple is so we're all done with sublimating onto the easy sublease and then pressing it onto our shirt it looks really nice and what i like about the easy subway is that it's very light so once you peel it away from that backing it's very light you don't feel it's not as bulky as um regular heat transfer vinyl sometimes and it pretty much almost blends in with of course it's not sublimation because it's not sublimated into the shirt but when you feel it it it there's a nice feel to it okay so remember this is another way for those of you who may not want to do the glitter um backing for your heat transfer onto black shirts or dark colored shirts and or cotton shirts easy suddenly is an option for you okay so i hope you all have enjoyed this tutorial i will have the information below uh where i got the easy subleaf from and yeah definitely i would go with this method um again and again so thank you so much for watching um if you enjoyed this video you learned something new or you were inspired to try sublimating onto easy subling please be sure to like the video and also subscribe to my channel where i will continue to post crafting videos using either the cricut or sublimation thank you so much for watching [Music]", "caUlh9mGySo": "[Music] hi guys its Cristo welcome back to my channel today we're going to be sublimating on 5050 so poly-cotton blend as well as a hundred percent cotton yes you heard me correctly a hundred percent cotton I've got a onesie and we'll talk about shirt that we're gonna do a hundred percent cotton on we're in a short with the 50/50 now I don't know if you guys have heard of this or not but there is a company that is called dye press now what they have invented this has been out for a little bit I've been watching some videos on it and I finally reached out to them a while back and asked if they could send me some of these to try out on the channel and they totally agree right away they had them in them in the mouth so we're going to be not only trying today's going to be cotton but not only are we gonna be doing cotton shirts or cotton material we're going to be doing poly gloss so this is going to be four glass metal marble stone ceramic glass acrylic white board and wood so we could get those Dollar Tree cups and coat it with this stuff and be able to use those in our press instead of have an order and then also they carry poly natural this is for coating wooden stone so you can get some of those nice wood you know to make some coasters and stuff coat those and be able to sublimate on those as well so any type of cutting boards so no longer having to special order anything you could run down to Walmart and grab some cups or shirts or whatever it may be and do this okay so let's start with today doing the cotton this is gonna work if you're working on white grey or colored shirts that is oatmeal she has created videos on this so I'll have those linked down below there's three different videos so you can check those out so you can learn what the Desai's are all about and all that I'm not gonna get into it just to save a little bit of time but if you have a white shirt a grey shirt or an oatmeal you're gonna want to put decider all the colors you're not gonna have to worry about this alright so first step on those will be the decider and then the next step is going to be the poly teeth this is what's gonna give us that coating like the polyester type coating and that's what's gonna make us be able to sublimate on a hundred percent cotton is we're gonna go in and I'm going to show you how to mix it up and everything walk through spraying it and we're going to press it today we're going to press it with the cricket easy press you can do the same thing with or heat press she sent me two bottles that are already just like this these are 8 ounce bottles because you want to mix 7 ounce water to each ounce of these so you need 7 ounce water 1 ounce this dirty has them so this bottle right here is the Desai's or hopefully you guys can see these so we're going to mix our the sizer in here and then the poly tea and the other one so let's get started so we need 7 ounces of water and you need to use purified water so I just I'm using bottled water from Walmart ok so I've got my bottled water and I'm gonna fill up my cup here so I've got a little measuring cup to 7 ounces all right there we go but it use a funnel these funnels come in like three in a pack I think it Walmart $4 where I got these long time ago so I'm going to pour my water in here alright just like so and I'm going to go ahead and Robert a date and pour the water in the other one do what we need to do now is I've got these little measuring cups even sent me the measuring cups into everything so I'm going to take some of the Desai's are here I'm gonna kind of mix it around just a little bit I don't think I need to but doing it anyway we need one ounce of each one so I'm gonna find where my once's are on here yeah seal on top so get that off and pour this in very carefully pour that over here all right and then what we need to do is put our lid on here and shake it up now she showed on her channel just kind of going like this a little bit and not just vigorously shaking it so that's what I'm gonna do just do this a few times and we need one else same thing we want to get this in here and then same thing she just kind of showed knocking it she just kind of showed going like this back and forth she didn't show lime vigorously shaking it so I'm just gonna kind of do what she did and if you guys notice this you guys probably noticed this right off the bat I put them in the wrong container because that's what I do so what I'm gonna do right away is I'm going to I was gonna fill that off but that's not gonna work I'm gonna have to mark them out I'm gonna have to just kind of you know scribble this I'll get some vinyl and vinyl this later you know me it's gonna be vinyl so I'm gonna go ahead and put poly T on it and then do the same thing because I already know I'm fixing me messing that up alright and then I'm gonna put D sizer there we go and all like I said I'll just put vinyl on them later but try not to do what I just did but just wanted to show that really quickly because you don't want to do these backwards obviously okay so let's go ahead and get started we've got my shirt ready to go and so I'm doing white so we need to use the B sizer so I'm gonna take a piece of cardboard I'm gonna protect my Cricut make her back there by the way so this cardboard is actually just from by those inserts that come in our chocolate or packages so I just been saving them for stuff like this okay so what we need to do is you need to spray around the area that you're going to be sublimating because obviously that's what we need to take care of right and in the meantime I'm gonna go ahead and get our keys II press ready to go I'm gonna move my design out of the way we need to get our easy press to three eighty five so I'm going to push the temperature there and go all the way up to three eighty five now this first press is not going to be timed we're just doing steam so I'm gonna have that ready to go so the first thing we need to do is the decider so making sure I got the right one so what we need to do is you want to spray about where you're sublimating so go bigger than the area hopefully you guys can see all this I may have to zoom out so you want to go ahead and spray within the area where you're going to be sublimating or obviously it defeats the purpose so I'm going to spray a big enough area is what I'm just gonna do to make sure soda size there so I'm just going to make sure so you want to make sure you're coating everything very well and then she showed just kind of patting it down to kind of get that moisture in there so just want to get it nice and wet obviously I don't think she got a drench so we're just making sure that everything is getting cutted because when you look at it in person you can kind of see what's wet and what's not wet so I'm just kind of pushing that in okay and I think I'm going to go over it one more time I'm gonna press that in there so now I'm just kind of going and patting that down a little bit just making sure everything seems pretty nice too wet all right so what we need to do in our easy press is almost there I'm gonna go and get my shirt off of this and kind of rub it as well and I think she only really showed that with the poly tube I'm doing anyway but it kind of helps get that you know even on there so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna spread this out now for this next step what you need to do is you need to take she said a piece of cotton but it has to be washed already it has to be used because if not it's got decider in it because it's no so you're just putting right on top so I'm using my husband's old white t-shirt ignore it because it looks really old and dingy so you can use a hand towel whatever it may be but you want to use a used so now what I'm going to do is we want to give that out of there so I'm going to go ahead and press until we see steam coming out okay good so once you see that steam coming out you can lift that up and move this out of the way go ahead and I'm gonna do it one more time just because sure that I'm coating the whole area where my stuff's going so I'm just going in the area where I haven't done yet so just over here on the side now if yours completely covered that area you would not need to do this again so I'm just kind of waiting for that steam to come a little bit just being super safe alright so now for the next step is we're gonna need our cardboard back Harper back in here and this time we're doing 385 for 70 seconds 385 for 70 seconds so before I forget I'm gonna change my deal over here to 70 seconds now what we need to do is spray our area and I'm gonna measure down three just make sure okay we're gonna spray our area where our image is gonna go once again so we're gonna take that poly tea this time so we're taking the poly tea and we're going to spray and coat where our image is going so we're going all the way around she shows kind of you can use your image to poop it over and spray around to get like a an area but I pretty much know I'm going to be right in here so that's just what I'm doing so I'm just making sure everything is getting nice and coated alright so that looks good to me in half like I showed a while ago and we're gonna go ahead and rub these rub this down to get that fully coated once we have it ready to go we're going to want to air dry this or you can dry it with your blow dryer or your heat press or your ez press the way that you're gonna want to do this is to get this dry a little bit I'm gonna go over just hovering over it with my iron so I'm just kind of hovering just to kind of help dry it a little bit I don't have it on there now you wouldn't want to sit here and do these one after another like that I wouldn't want to what I would do is I would a head of time Desai's my shirts and then I would come back spray em with the poly coke that way they're all ready to sublimate and then you're ready to go that way you're not back and forth back and forth with each one so now what we're gonna do is I'm going to put my image down where I want it and I'm gonna actually to kind of avoid these harsh lines I've showed you before is to kind of tear it like this I'm bringing it down so I can see where I'm putting my image all right so what I'm gonna do is come down three I know where I'm going here and you know me I can eyeball where I'm at all right so say I'm happy with where that's at she shows that you need to coat it with two pieces of parchment paper this time so we're doing 385 for 70 seconds so we're gonna go ahead and get this down remember you want to stay completely still when it comes to sublimation so I'm just going to give it some firm pressure and hit go you all right there we have it so now I need to carefully pick this up so we don't get our ghosting and there you have it so you can hear that kind of stick just a little bit and now you can see how vibrant that is now I've sublimated already before on 5050 so it's nothing new but you can see how much more vibrant that is all right so now for our last step is you want to go over this one more time with your poly T and that's gonna give it a final top coat so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna put this back underneath here to protect everything got my cardboard back alright get my shirt up here and we're going to spray it with that poly T one more time just coating everything so you're just gonna go over with a nice little thin layer just like that that's gonna help hold that ink in you need to do is just press this for 10 seconds at 300 she said if you press it again at 385 at a high temp you're sublimating again so what we're gonna do I'm gonna change the temp to 300 so we're gonna hit temp come down to 300 all right now while the temperature was dropping and I need to change my time hold on now while the temperature was dropping what she did was hover again don't stick it directly on there I'm just hovering on top this is how she was drawing it as it was going down except for she was using heat pressing obviously but you just take your easy press and you're gonna hover over it as that heat is dropping plead this dry before this finished I'm dropping and that's totally okay so I don't have to hold it the whole time so I mean that's gonna get heavy it only took me about 10 15 seconds to relieve that dry so I didn't take no time at all so this last press all we need is one piece of parchment paper and we're going to go down for 10 seconds so we're gonna hit go so I've got it at 300 for 10 seconds all right there we have it now this shirt is completely finished so it's completely done now the only thing that I do notice with this is whenever you do this whole process here hopefully you guys can see this there it is and it says this heifer needs a vacation this is an image from Etsy I will link you down below the one thing I am noticing is it's given like a almost like a different right here and it feels like now it has almost like a like this is just hopefully you guys can hear this now it's not like a thick plastic or anything but it's got a coating you can tell it has a coating there I want to say because she does have like a whole group and like a Facebook page and I'll have it linked down below as well as to where people talk about you know how to use this stuff you know just basically kind of like one of those like a Facebook gun like a cricket group so anyways but there is one for this die press where they give tips and tricks so I'll leave it link down below but I think somebody said once you wash this that that all goes away so we're gonna find that out I'm gonna do that before I sell this because I'm gonna sell this down at my booth so I will let you know how that works out so there's that isn't it awesome how cool is that and this is about 50/50 because 50-50 doesn't usually come out this bright so I'm really excited about that now let's do some hundred percent cotton this cute little tee here this is another one of those wonder tees I got from Walmart I told you guys the other day this is a hundred percent cotton and I'm gonna show you guys this is that one donation higher percent cotton I'm gonna bring it up hopefully you guys can see the information there 100% cotton we're going to take our cardboard once again I'm gonna get our cute little shirt down and the first step that we're gonna do is cover it with the Desai's or making sure I'm grabbing the right one and we're gonna cover the area so I know about where this is going so I'm just going to go over it again and like I said she was kind of padding which is just kind of pushing the the Desai's are into the material you know how if you get something wet it kind of wants to hover on top for just a second so until it soaks just to kind of speed that up a little bit pushing right in now like I said I'm probably going excess with the Desai's er you really don't need to use this much but I'm just making sure I want to coat everything so obviously I'll get the fill about the more I play with this stuff all right I cannot wait to play with the other ones and get some dollar tree mugs okay so same thing I'm gonna fold this in half and kind of push on that just a little bit to kind of really get that in there now we need to bump our temperature back up to the 385 all right and this one we're just doing the steam and this one we're just pressing until you see that steam I think it took about 15 seconds last time I had a cleaner spot so you guys aren't having to look at that ugliness of it all right so I'm gonna press and oh I don't know why I hit the timer I didn't need to hit the timer but I hit 10 seconds so let's see if it does it in 10 seconds I guess if not we'll hit time again I guess we could kind of figure out how long it takes I'm gonna hit it again all right so about 30 seconds is what that took to get that steam out okay you bring our cardboard back in all right just like so and we need to do that 70 seconds again I'm gonna take our poly tea and we're going to coat it so we need to coat it to where whoever our image is going to be all right so once we've got that coated I'm gonna fold it in half and rub that in and I'm gonna go ahead and move this out of the way rubbing a little bit easier and better try not to stretch my shirt obviously there we have it so what I've been doing to protect my my mat I didn't mention that before is I've got down a piece of just paper is what it is this is just butcher paper I've got that down and then we're going to take our image for this one here we're gonna do like a fourth of July theme so it's gonna be America alright so we need to make sure and cover this until that's pretty much dry you really would want to do this stuff just ahead of time so you're not sitting here having to individually dry these because you can air dry them and that way they're just completely ready to go and the last step you're having to do is cover them with the Polish brain one more time all right so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna get this down just kind of making sure it's where I need it to be I didn't do this on the last one but I want to try it on this one is I want to use that die trans pro-spray that's gonna help hold this down I know it's not going to shift and you can use the tape as well but let's try it and see if it works with this product are you giving it a second all right so just making sure and going where I need to be all right so say that looks good to me now I've got that in place I also mentioned and I want to try it this time she used a piece of just regular copy paper but I'm gonna use butcher paper and then she used her two pieces of parchment paper just to protect the parchment paper so you can use them more so they don't yellow right so or get the ink coming through so we're going to hit go 70 seconds all right pull all of our paper is here and now we're going to peel this off there you have it this is a hundred percent cotton so hopefully you can see that there it is sublimating on 100% cotton how cool is that 100% cotton so let's see if I can see the ring on this one I don't really see the ring as much as I do now obviously you can see where my press was setting but I don't see it like I did on the other one so I don't know if it's because it was a blend but this is 100% cotton and I'm not having that now you can feel the difference so this is you can hear and this is t-shirt and then that I brought you over to my mic so you guys could hear a little bit better so anyways but look how cool that is 100% cotton so you can go down to Walmart and get some of these t-shirts you can go down Target wherever it may be somewhere locally grab some t-shirts and make them and so wouldn't that be awesome to be able to have on hand so I'm really excited about this stuff and I mean look at how much I have less so far from doing two t-shirts oh really don't take much if you guys can see that there's still pretty much full it's hard to tell you but I just I've used a lot of decider I think I've used too much all right now let me go ahead and quickly the last step that we have to do is protect this with one more top coat of that poly tea but I'm going to set this aside and let's go ahead and do two baby onesies really quick so these are 100% organic cotton from Walmart and we're going to be 282 different design so I'm gonna go ahead and cut these down cut them in half just really heavy and then we're gonna start on our process really quick just so we have these I want to make sure they're gonna fit because I haven't double-check those you know I've already printed these once again all these images I got from Etsy and I will have them linked down below so that's gonna fit on there very well and then same with this cute little cat one okay so let's go ahead and get going so two little onesies and I'm gonna spray them at the same time so I can be do them together get our onesies and I'm gonna get both of them up here hopefully you guys with us and both and I'm gonna spray em both at the same time okay one is the 12 months 1 2 3 to 6 months so remind me unifor and over here cow cuz we're gonna forget you I'm already gonna tell you this size our first so we're gonna go over both of those so just kind of spritzing those just making sure wherever that image is gonna go that we've got it spritzed pushing that in I'm gonna go ahead move over to the next one and it's super hot in my she shed right now because I'm waiting to get my I'm still working guys another lot of you guys have questions what's going on that I have so much it's just been crazy we saw have everything to do basically I mean just well basically I've got to go to Ikea and we're gonna do that at the end of the month and I need to put my floors in and that's pretty much it but um my I've got to get my mini split you know my air conditioner but I can't turn on my fan because it's super loud for the video and I'm dying right so anyways I'm gonna finish spritzing these really well alright am I gonna fold these in half this I'm not gonna worry about it all right we're just gonna make sure they're spritz okay so what I'm gonna do well actually I'm gonna fold them in half I'm getting them off of here so there we go so you can see how we're protecting our workspace get this down now I could use my 6 by 7 and I think that's what I'm actually gonna do I'm gonna move this guy out of the way and let's use our 6 by 7 to sublimate all right now this one's gonna be the same thing where we need the cotton t-shirt as you guys can see me and my husband went out on the boat this weekend and I got super sunburned so it's been great we're gonna be pulling out the steam what we're using for this one is the cotton t-shirts I'm going to cover up our onesie and I'm gonna go ahead and press now this one there's no time we're just pressing until that steam comes out giving it firm pressure steam coming up so now I'm gonna pull this off and this one is ready to go let this one aside and press the next one we're ready to go so I'm going to spray it again now with a poly tea so we're gonna grab these cut down our cardboard here and I'm gonna spritz both of these with that poly tea so I'm gonna go ahead and get these on here you may not be able to see them both but they're both here okay well let's go ahead and get that poly T so for the pointy once again you're just spritzing where you're working all right so same thing you're gonna want to fold them in half fold them in half and I'm gonna move them over to rub them Medwin rub it so I can make sure that's nice and even try not to shake my camera everywhere for the 12 months we are going to have the unicorn right ahead and dry this I'm just hovering it over now this one I'm not going to use the spray I'm gonna do it without and so now we're gonna go ahead and get our image down about where I want it to be so say I'm happy with that I can see it you guys I think you guys can lightly see it so I can kind of see where I'm going with this just stick it down just like that I'm gonna go ahead and do the same thing where I've got the I've got three layers here so I've got the paper but put your paper and then the parchment paper I'm gonna get these down and then I'm going to go ahead and get my iron down on here so just like this and I'm gonna hit go 70 seconds all right with this out of the way movies and pull this up there we have it super cute 100% cotton organic cotton it's that if that it's 100% organic cotton look at that on a percent cotton how awesome it's hot so I'm trying to hold it here and with a crooked easy breast um once again I don't really see that outline like I did on that first one so I must have overdid maybe the desizing or even the spritz I'm not too sure but there you have it how freaking cute is that it says whatever I do what I want in that cute with that uniform we put this on that cup a while back okay so I'm gonna set this out of the way already got it ready to go so all we're gonna do is let's dry it just a little bit um same thing once again you wouldn't have to go through this if you pre did this and let them air dry I think that's ready to go this one is going to be new to the herd with these foot with cows I know it's backwards until we press it but look how cute so what we're going to do is line this up once again I can see through it y'all may not be able to and we're going to get this down I'm gonna go ahead and do the pro-spray again alright so I'm gonna go ahead and get that about where I want it so say I'm happy with it here making sure my shirt is flat same thing I've got my butcher paper and my three pieces my three pieces no two pieces of parchment paper I'm going to be making sure I'm staying right between where I need to be and just get this down just like so and hit go first so we're gonna pick this up alright and we're gonna put these out of the way now one thing I want to mention too with this spray as well as this because it sticks down you can always test so in case I didn't get over here over here you could always test it first and take a little peek so say you see how peaking like that I can actually lay it back down and go again and I wouldn't have to worry about ghosting because it's got such a strong grip on it now I'm going to kill this off and there you have it super cute look at how cute that is new to the herd Oh cute look at those colors 100% cotton organic cotton I'm gonna show you guys really quick um organic cotton is what it says Gerbert organic cotton there you go I don't maybe a little bit blurry this one's a three to nine months but look at how cute once again on this one I can't really see the difference on here you can see where my iron was but you have a little bit of that scratch hopefully you guys can hear that bringing it over and compared to the shirt not as bad I really think I just overdid it on my first shirt but there you are I love it so cute awesome okay so for the final step all we have to do is we've got these last three here we just need to spray them one more time with that poly tea now what you want to do is you want to air dry these first because know they need to be dry and then we're gonna press them at 300 for 10 seconds so I'm gonna go and change my timer but what I would do once again if I was doing a bunch of these at once I would go ahead and let them air dry and then come back later and get them all at one time so I'm not having to hover over these or blown with a blow dryer so I'm gonna go and bring my temperature my temperature I brought my temperature down to 300 now I'm bringing my time down to 10 all right while that temperature is dropping I thought I go ahead and talk about these one more time they're you know eight ounce bottles so like you could get them bigger though you can get them in bigger bottles like this like the 16 ounces and stuff but the 8 ounce bottles you're gonna need the decider and you're gonna need the eight outs now if you're doing colored shirts don't worry about this just spray it with the poly tee and then you're ready to go with that if it's colored but if it's white gray or oatmeal color you want to push the potion put the v-slicer but think about it this way with eight ounces it takes one ounce of this for each bottle and then the water so you're gonna get eight bottles each of this stuff right here so you can see how much I've used hopefully you guys can see that I've barely used anything hopefully I'm trying to hold it cuz if I hold it sideways it's gonna go this way so let me put right here so I'm only used to right about here where my thumb is on this one I've probably excessively used that I've went to right about there but you're gonna get eight of these eight ounce because each one's gonna fill up to eight ounces you're gonna get eight of these so that's how much clothing you can do I mean quite a bit and like I said I go ahead and and do all the ones that you need but you do not need the decider so if you weren't doing the on the colored shirts you're only gonna need this one bottle which is decisive but remember I marked it out and put poly tea crystals can a vinyl that so you would only need one of these if you're gonna be doing just colored shirts so it's pretty awesome and then like I said they've got other stuff too so you can do the poly gloss which you will be seeing very soon I'm fixing to be going and I might get some Dollar Tree cups I'm gonna get some Walmart cups and I'm gonna get maybe some like the glass cutting cutting trays and stuff like that and then with the poly natural maybe I'll do some tiles and stuff - I'll get several things because like I said it is for the gloss let's say it one more time it's metal marble stone ceramic glass acrylic whiteboard and wood so I will have a bunch of these items to try with that when we do that video very very soon with the wooden stone you can do it on those awesome pieces of wood you can do it on the cutting boards stone stuff like that and so I will have some of those to work with this so I'm pretty excited now with those two so the decides are you're gonna need this stuff here it is called catalyst I'm gonna take it out just yet but there it is by press catalyst and this is when you use the poly gloss or poly satin or the poly natural okay so you add one milliliter shippable of measuring things in there she's just like really I mean was a she made it perfect for me to be able to fill it up with the little measuring cups to display bottles gonna send a huge shout-out out to die press for sending these to me to try and like I said for the quick response and the fast delivery I asked and you guys delivered quick so I really truly appreciate that and so here we go so let's finish up these shirts last things we need to do is add the poly tee one more time lightly Kellie make sure everything gets its moist with it right this again protection everybody and everything alright alright there we go alright this time I'm going to show you just using your hair dryer to speed this up it's like that you're done it's really fast move that guy out of the way and I'm going to point this out it doesn't matter what drop blow-dryer you use this one's more expensive so don't go buy this one but the point this is just what I have it's just became my craft tool I've taken it from the kids my point is if you if yours has this nozzle or if you can make by this attachment separately super cheap I highly recommend that you use this nozzle because it it directs that air perfectly so when you're using this in the craft room it doesn't blow anything anywhere and it really directs that heat so highly recommend whatever dryer you get whether it's a ten dollar dryer make sure it has one of these or if you can attach one that way you can direct this however you want to you thing I'm gonna point out really fast is that I just now noticed when you spray that final coat of poly tea and don't over spray or you're going to make that bleed okay so you're going to end up making that blade you see where you can kind of see around that so don't over spray it with that poly tea now this one you can see nothing happened because I didn't know where spray that so be careful not to over saturate and I could tell you because this was really wet so just a tip alright so we just need one piece of parsnip for these and I'm gonna just go over it for ten seconds just like that so all the shirts completely done and ready to go toss that out of my way and bring in this one here cover it up here it go alright so there we have it's completely done so once it's not ten seconds you're good to go like I said be careful not to over spritz I'm going to slip it out of the way and we've got our last one here so America what I'm gonna try to do with this is turn it this way and put my press on there this way I'm gonna you can see I didn't know I didn't know where spray on that one either so I'm gonna hit go oh gee so there you have it so you have America and actually it looks like it did use so tiny bit there on the sea so just try not to over spray on that so there's booze and then here's this one there we go super cute love it and then while we're trying here's our first one we did and you can see how obviously did not overspray on that one I did really good look how vibrant that one now this is 50/50 so if you spray on 50/50 you're gonna get even more vibrant than before so basically when you're spraying on hundred percent cotton you can see that's a little bit lighter and I know there are two different images but you can see this is 50/50 so half polyester half cotton and before if I did it without the spray this is the color tone you would have had with this so basically these kind of are now like 50/50 cotton if you if that makes sense but before you could not sublimate at all on cotton and make it stay without washing it out but this type of color tones is what would have been in this but because this was without spray look at how vibrant it was like BAM so I'm pretty excited about that so huge shout out to die press for sending this stuff to us and letting us test it out super exciting about that highly recommend that you check this stuff out maybe we can sublimate on 100% cotton and so I'm really excited we can do dish towels all kinds of stuff possibilities are endless so stay tuned we got two more trials to do with two more different type of videos for the poly gloss and they're probably natural so I hope you guys enjoyed this I hope you found it helpful if you did please hit the like button down below and subscribe and I'll see you on the next one", "vyogufzuHRY": "hey everyone welcome back to ride with ink i'm brian today we are going to talk about the 2021 new year t-shirts that we are currently selling we have designed four of these t-shirts using canography not not everyone is this some we use smaller pens there are four designs in total the first one is the 2021 plus t-shirt in white and another one is in red and the next one is the blessings t-shirt and the last one is destiny t-shirt selling shirts is not easy especially if you are a first time selling t-shirts and if your connection or network is not great it is quite a challenge to sell t-shirts and there are a lot a lot of work behind all these selling features before launching this 2021 new year t-shirt series i have found my friend sharon who is also a full-time graphic designer to help me out with this small venture me and sharon took about two weeks to come up with the designs so generally the steps is take the calligraphy brush draw some drawings or writings on papers check it put it into photoshop process it and send it to sharon so she will help me out on the refining part for the printing okay and also actually putting the words into a shirt design chinese calligraphy is somewhat like a traditional art so it is quite the challenge to put this traditional art into a modern form which is on a t-shirt let me show you my drops so as you can see here this power here yeah it's mostly crumpled paper but here's my drafts and here also there's somewhat my drops over here but it is all crumpled together and [Music] the last part here yeah it's really messy i know it is really messy but i will sort it out the next few days okay so these are all my drops so these are the four final shirt designs which are on the screen and also selling right now so we initially we wanted four different designs but yeah we had three so we duplicate one with another color which make it for designs so the first design is this one 2021 plus t-shirt the idea behind this is quite simple we just take the number one in the 2021 and change it into a chinese character one we also want to emphasize on the importance of this one we want to encourage people to take on one more extra thing or one more different thing to you know add on to your life so that's why we call it the 2021 plus t-shirt okay the second t-shirt is a very typical chinese you know chinese new year design and i wanted to put a little bit of spin of it okay by making the blessing work very big yeah here are my blessings what it is really really big so yeah the mic oh yeah so it's really really big and it is around 100 plus cm if i'm not mistaken and it takes me this brush to write it uh no ask me how do i know how to write the brush i just i just write it okay so yeah that's the twist for the traditional typical chinese red gold t-shirt now for the last design is the destiny t-shirt okay so actually i got the inspiration from the anime called kimi no nawa your name and there's a concept that the movie explained quite interestingly which is the concept of muslim which is a red string okay which connects us together something like that then it struck me that in chinese culture that we also have something very similar to it and it is this rich chinese pendant made by strings this thing is closely related to the word destiny or fate by combining these two together we get this teacher the destiny t-shirt after finalizing everything we waited for the samples to print and it's time for photoshoot filmmaker [Music] we got two of our friends rex and sing we put them over it's actually quite a last minute plan i i caught them like the day before the shoot and they are willing to help i'm very happy about that so sharon took all the pictures and i just stood there and took some videos some stock footage okay for the ads that will be coming out yeah it was quite a lot of work and i'm really happy that my friends are willing to help out knowing me i wanted to do some of my own stuff okay so i dragged my friends again to help me out with the further shootings of two videos of me using this pan the big big brush to write the word and the word blessing [Music] it is quite a learning curve for me because so many things are happening directing you know photo shooting videography everything is happening at the same time so i need to learn fast and adapt to it finishing up all the photo shooting and all the stuff we did it in one day yeah i'm happy with the outcome and the efficiency so next part is editing the most painful part of the entire process i'm not that great of a graphic designer my designing skills are just so so not that good but can use okay and i have assignments now is december end of december they like to give out assignments like nobody's business so i'm deal with both of these at the same time sharon did help me out a lot by you know guiding me and teaching me some of the stuff that is quite obvious like the house the basics the principles of anything which i did not really have okay three weeks later after finishing up the editing we have to move on to the most important part which is selling projects so i have to do many many stuffs including this video which is part of the promotion and the many many creative stuff that i've done i need to put it on facebook i didn't put it on instagram i didn't put it on whatsapp every social media that i can think of i will put it on there and let it roll this is how you design and sell 2021 new year t-shirts if you like the designs or you just want something new to wear for your 2021 or

really like to start this video by saying huge thank you to sofia for sending me over these pieces but yeah i've got like i think seven or eight things to show you so i'm just going to show you now and i really hope you enjoy the video if you do please make sure to like it and subscribe if you want to so yeah let's get into the video so the first side of the clothing i have to show you is actually this dress i have on right now i'm gonna have on the screen like the prices and stuff like that and i'm gonna have every single thing linked down below in the description box if you are interested in buying any of these things next thing i got from sapple was this really cute oversized like tie-dye print top and it's like this tie-dye thing which is so in at the moment i feel like everybody's wearing tie-dye so i had to get this how i would pair this would be like i think i would wear it tucked into like some jeans and like puff it out at the bottom like puff it up and make it look just like a chill casual thing and i feel like you're gonna look really cool in this so i'm absolutely so excited to wear this i feel like this is gonna be such a perfect like little talk to wear whenever you're going to a lecture because it's like effortless but you still look cool [Music] the next thing i got is something that is absolutely being going around social media so so much like i feel like this trend has just sparked up from like literally nowhere and then like all of a sudden everybody's wearing it but i got all these little silk like what do you call these it's not bandeau okay so it's a bomb down there oh my god that literally was so annoying because i couldn't remember the name of this but yeah it's a bandana so yeah you just like tie around your chest like this and then you tie at the back and honestly has this not just being the thing that like like the trend of the summer but i absolutely love it and it's really thick material like i i didn't think it was going to be so high quality but it actually is it's so good and i got this in a size medium because just like for reference because i think the small would have probably not fit around me but yeah absolutely love this little thing i think this would look really nice with high waisted like light wash denim jeans not jane's shorts for like a wee outfit to go to the beach in or just chilling because it had been so warm recently like i went to liverpool like a week ago oh my goodness it was like a hidden 30 degrees every single day and i'm just like why did i not bring these clothes with me i didn't think it was going to be that warm so i didn't pack any like summer clothes and now i really forgot it because i would have loved to worn this just like with some shorts and just podding around liverpool but i didn't bring it with me unfortunately another thing i got from zaful was this cute little crop top it's like a one shoulder thing and then it ties in at the waist here which i think is going to be so flattering and i have been looking high and low for a cropped like a one shoulder top because for ages like i have wanted one for such a long time i've just never find like the right one so when i seen this on the website i was like oh my god i need to get it right now and it's actually such a super thick material like it actually feels quite good it's quite heavy and stuff so yeah i'll try this on for you and you'll be able to see what it looks like [Music] next thing i got from southpaw was like i just seen this on the website and i just was like i need to try this because i've been looking for a pleated skirt knife for so long like i know i said that about the last um piece of clothing but honestly i've been looking for a skirt like this for so long and i just have not been able to find it like plt don't do them the only pieces i've seen skirts like this have been like urban outfitters and they've been like way too expensive for me so it's this cute little high-waisted pleated like checkered skirt i don't know if checkered is the right word like pinstripe i don't know what i don't know don't ask me but yeah it's this cute skirt it's like high waisted and it comes down to like the perfect length like it's not too short it's not too long either i wish you could feel this because it's so thick like it's not flimsy like i feel like when people order off of these online websites you kind of are concerned that the quality isn't going to be the best but honestly everything i've got so far has been such good thick good quality material which i just love i think i'm going to try and style this like with an oversized like jumper thing but i haven't yet to find a nice oversized jumper but i think this would look cute with a big oversized jumper and like some jewelry around your neck and i just think like a laid back chill vibes but yet you still look really cool i don't know like i said 40 million videos i cannot put together outfits like it's not my forte but i think whenever you have like cute staple pieces like this you're going to look cool no matter what you know [Music] okay so the next thing i got was actually a bikini i think saffel are probably best known for their bikinis like they're so cheap they're so good quality and they're just literally perfect like they've got so many different designs of bikinis like if you get one thing from this haul go on sample and get like a swimwear because you should just go you can scroll through the website for hours to literally find them because there's so many choices but i just got this little bikini top which i think is stunning again tie dye is so in at the minute and so that is going to be perfect for this summer so the bottoms of this bikini just look like this um and they're quite cheeky at the back well i actually was looking at these and i don't know which way is the front and the back like i'm actually confused like is the big part for the front or is the little part for the front like i actually can't tell we have to try this on to see like what way it's supposed to work but then this is the thing that's so big this bikini right so it comes with a separate bikini top and like i'm sorry but you could literally wear this with like jeans like this it's like a top as well as a bikini like absolutely vibes and it cinches in at the boobs there so it's gonna make you look unreal but yeah i just thought how perfect is this like so have you ever been to a water park and you're wearing a bikini and you go down the slide and next thing you know water has rearranged your top to say the least i just think this is going to be like the most practical bikini for situations when you want to go to a water park and you know this is not going anywhere it's holding you all in also if you're on holiday and you've got like sunburned shoulders happens to me every holiday like no matter how much sunscreen i put on my shoulders they still manage to get like red raw burn like this is the perfect bikini for those days when you're burnt so absolutely vibes cannot wait twice on holiday i wish i was going on holi this year but obviously things didn't go to plan but yeah next year i cannot wait to be wearing this by the pool living my best life okay so the last thing i got from staple is this cute little handbag this sort of looks like up close i just think that it is so adorable it is so summery and so cute and it's literally just me all over like i absolutely love pink girly things that have like floors on them like that is me tootie i just absolutely love it but this bag is going to be so cute just with like every single summer dress like i know you can't really see it here but i just think that is going to be an absolute dream in the summer time so that's the end of today's video i really hope you enjoyed watching if you did please make sure to like and also subscribe if you want to lastly i would just like to say a massive thank you to zaful for kind of gifting me these items i feel so blessed to be working with such a big company so yeah thank you so much zaful for sending me these items all the items will be linked in

subscribe in my channel and see you next time bye bye", "8ZUyLBQDl3g": "today I am testing my subscribers favorite white t-shirts basically I asked you guys on Instagram to tell me the brand name and the style name of your all-time favorite white t-shirt and then I dumped all that information into Excel I tallied up the top five and I bought one of each end of my size so we're gonna go through each one I'm going to talk about price size fit quality I'm even gonna see if it shrinks after I wash it and the goal is to just help you guys find your perfect white t-shirt so let's get started okay let's start off with the fifth most popular t-shirt the fifth most popular t-shirt according to you guys is this James purse vintage little boy T James purse is a luxury basics brand so this was the most expensive out of the top five the price of this is $75 it comes in five sizes from zero to four which kind of mimic like extra small to extra large and I got this t-shirt in a size zero and I'm just gonna read the description off the website like an old favorite from the first we're at this lightweight cotton Jersey t is garment dyed with extra softener and silicon for a lived-in feel and this one is a hundred percent cotton just like my previous video I'm going to be ranking each one on three things which is fit quality and value they're all gonna get a total score and then at the end we'll see how my ranking compares to yours so let's try this bad boy on and see what I think alright here it is the James purse t-shirts I really love this I have a mirror right behind the camera that I'm kind of like referencing the fit of this is so nice though like especially like the sleeves and the shoulder seams I feel like just lay really perfectly like this area is just so seamless and nice it's very boxy but I feel like it flows and lays really nicely on the body like it's a little bit tighter up here and then it's a bit looser down here but do you see how like if I kind of move like it it's not too stiff the fabric almost lays like this it's so flattering I also really like the Vivat this is a really good kind of like semi cropped length I love the sleeves they're like perfectly short this is what the back looks like it's so soft too like uh it's just super cozy and soft the material feels really nice and lightweight but it's not sheer it's like the kind of perfect opacity and I really like the weight of it how it's like kind of thin so that it floats on the body really nicely but it's not too sheer all the like stitching and seams on this are flawless I honestly think that this one deserves a five out of five in terms of fit I'm just so pleased with how it lays on my body I feel like all the details are just really perfect the length of it the neckline the sleeves the shoulders like everything just is perfect so I'm definitely gonna give this a five out of five in terms of fit I'm also gonna give this a five out of five in terms of quality just the softness of it and how it's nice and opaque but it's like a nice lightweight material and how perfect like the fit is constructed and everything I think this deserves a five out of five but value I'm gonna bump it down because it's so expensive I'm gonna give this one a three for value because I do think that you should expect higher quality when you're paying more so it kind of makes sense but not everyone can dish out seventy five dollars for a t-shirt so the total is thirteen so this one got a total score of 13 out of 15 which is pretty good I just knocked it down a couple notches in terms of value just because it's so expensive and there are definitely high-quality white t-shirt options at a much lower price this is a little sunlight test for this James purse t-shirt I wanted to see how sheer these looked when I kind of put them up against a window so this is what that looks like and then I also ran each t-shirt through the washing machine after I did my initial trial and just to see if they shrunk so I did a warm wash and a tumble dry low which is a pretty standard wash and dry I feel like and so this is what the comparison is okay let's move on to the fourth most popular white t-shirt according to you so before the most popular pair was the Zara basics white t-shirt this is what she looks like the price this is $17.90 it comes in four sizes from small texture large it's 49 percent modal 33% lyocell and 18 percent linen so let's try this on and see what I think all right so this was the fourth most popular t-shirt it's so interesting trying all of these white t-shirts on at the same time first impressions is it already feels a lot of scratch here then the James purse one like it's just like I don't know the fabrics kind of interesting but I could see why you guys like it because it has that kind of same like it's thin ish so it gives that kind of like casual laid-back vibe you know I feel like in general this is a slightly more fitted t-shirt than the James purse one that I just tried on especially in this sleeve area like the sleeves are very tight and I can kind of feel that as I'm moving around my shoulders and stuff the body is fine and it has a bit of like give to it but the sleeves are definitely a little tight maybe I should have gone with a size medium lengthwise this is a more traditional length so it's not as cropped I do really like the crewneck line though it's a nice light comfortable a little bit more open than the James purse one this one is really sheer though like it's very very sheer like I don't know if you guys can tell I'll do a window test for all of these but looking in the mirror like so I'm wearing these high-waisted jeans when I put the shirt over them I can see the blue in the jeans through the shirt and I couldn't also see like the details of my bra and I'm wearing like a nude bra yeah I just don't think this fits very well I'm gonna give this a 3 in terms of fit I also don't love the quality on this like the stitching isn't great and it's pretty sheer and just the fact that this like fit issue is happening I'm gonna have to give this a 3 in terms of quality as well I'm also gonna give this a pretty low value score because this is seventeen ninety which is on the pricier side of like the lower end brands that you guys recommended and I don't think that the quality of this matches that price tag and I know for a fact that the other t-shirts that I'm about triune are less than that and I think just from feeling them not even trying them on I think they're gonna be higher quality so I'm gonna give this a three let's see how it does tomorrow when I wash it okay this one didn't do so hot this ended up with a total ranking of 9 out of 15 there's just something a little bit off about this one I also want to mention that this one shrunk the most after I pulled it out of the dryer I wasn't sure how these interesting kind of fabrics we're gonna handle the tumble dry if you want to take extra good care of your clothing I would recommend hang-drying items that you're really concerned about but I wanted to give these like a good realistic test of putting them in the dryer and seeing if they shrunk so that is the Tzar one a little bit disappointing but let's move on to it the third most popular t-shirts the third most popular t-shirt is the one I'm wearing right now and this is one from brandy melville so this is called the Haley t-shirt and it's $16 on brandy melville it comes in one size as is pretty typical waste brandy melville stuff and it's 100% cotton the description is that it's a soft and stretchy cotton tee with a crewneck collar alright so let's cut to the Tryon portion and I'll tell you guys what I think ooh interesting okay this is kind of fun because this is a totally different style and silhouette then basically all the other white t-shirts which are more boxy this one is a nice fitted option which I actually think it's good to have like a more fitted tight option and a looser fitting option I really like the feel of this right now but I'm a sucker for brandy melville stuff because the materials they use are just so soft and comfortable I actually really like the way this fits you guys always choose the best stuff that's why I love these videos is because it like opens my eyes to all these amazing options I mean there's a reason that this stuff you know floats to the top if you're really pretty I think this is a great option I really like it when sleeves have a bit of like a gap here I just think it's nice and flattering and I also really like the length it's like a pretty cropped length looks good with like high-waisted stuff this fabric is ever so slightly ribbed which is kind of interesting it gives like a different texture than the others the other ones are just like kind of a straight-up cotton II feel this one if you look closely you can see a bit of ribbing to it which I think helps it with that stretch it is also pretty opaque like since it's tight you're kind of seeing a little bit of my bra here but like you're not actually seeing the color and like here you can't really see like my jeans or anything so I think the opacity is really good on this okay I actually really like this brandy melville one fit wise I'm gonna give this a 4 out of 5 I think this one fits really well for the look that it's going for which is that kind of like tighter white t-shirt look okay obvious con is that they only make this in one size and while I think like tiny t-shirts are good like this for petite sizes obviously it's not gonna work for everyone which is a bummer quality I think this is definitely better than the Zara one but lower than the James purse the stitching looks decent but it's not like pristine like the James purse one so I'm gonna give it a four out of five and then value-wise let me check the price really quick yeah this one is $16 so a dollar too cheaper than the Zara one but better in my opinion even though it's a very different look so it's hard to compare but I would give it a value of four because for sixteen dollars I think this is a really good option okay so Brandi did pretty good this one got a total score of 12 out of 15 I actually really really like this one and I think a lot of you guys will like it too if you're similar to my size this one is shrunk a tiny bit after I washed it but it is kind of like a ribbed material that kind of stretches out as you wear it it's kind of like jeans they kind of stretch out as you wear it and then you wash it to kind of return it to its original form okay let's move on to the second most popular t-shirt the runner-up most popular teacher according to you guys and it is this one from H&M this is called the slump Jersey t-shirt so this t-shirt is $9.99 it comes in sizes extra extra extra small to extra large it's 50% cotton and 50 cent mote doll and the description says t-shirt in slob Jersey made from a model and cotton blend with a round neckline and a straight cut hem so let's try this guy on and see what I think okay this one is hmmm very similar to the Zara one very very similar interesting it's interesting how the Tzar one and the H&M one the one I'm wearing right now they have kind of longer sleeves I feel like it gives a slightly different look I kind of have preference towards the cap sleeves that are a lot shorter and more slanted I think that gives off a more stylish vibe this one's also longer the sleeves are longer it's a longer length it has kind of an interesting texture it's almost like a cooling fabric I feel like this is very breathable it's slightly less sheer than the Tzar one but it's still one of the more sheer ones like it's I would say Zara so far has been the most sheer and then this one's runner up I also feel like the quality's not good like do you guys see this it's almost like slanting I don't love that and I also feel like the sleeves are having this weird bubble thing happen because this hem is so wide this like little trim part here that it's almost like bubbling over and then the neckline is also kind of flappy I noticed that when I was putting it on yeah I'm not loving this honestly the fabric also it it feels cottony but it's a little bit like a slick cotton it's almost too smooth it's like when I wear cotton I want it to kind of feel like it has a bit of friction to it this one is very very silky almost yeah I don't know if I like that I almost feel like it looks kind of pyjama hmm interesting fit wise I honestly don't like this I think I'm gonna give this a 2 the sleeves are too long the neckline is too big and it's kind of flappy this is weird I'm gonna give this one of three quality wise because the stitching is fine but like the fact that it looks basically like an asymmetrical hem even though it's not supposed to look like that is concerning and then I also just feel like some things are off with the construction value-wise this is the cheapest option out of everything that I am trying today so value wise I'm going to give this a three I don't think this is like anything amazing for the price I almost feel like the price should be lower this one was not good the total score for this H&M t-shirt an 8 out of 15 womp womp my biggest problems were with the fit I just thought it fit really weird it almost looked like I was wearing pajamas there was also some funky stuff going on like how be have mine looked like it was asymmetrical even though it wasn't supposed to be and the weird bubbling of the sleeves it was just it was just weird so this one got an 8 out of 15 all right let's move on to number one the number one most popular white t-shirt by a landslide this one t-shirt had more than double the amount of votes than any of the other t-shirts and that is the unique low you crew neck t-shirt you guys seem to love this t-shirt and I was really excited that it made it so high on your list so let's cut to the Tryon section and see what I think about your guys is number one white t-shirt choice ok this is the most popular t-shirt according to you guys I think this is like a very good super classic white tee option it's just a straight cut down it's not cropped it has a nice like inbetween sleeve like you can see you had a little bit of that slant that I like but it's not as like much of a cap sleeve as the James purse one or the Brandie one one interesting thing about the fit that I'm noticing is like when I was kind of just like holding up all these t-shirts in my hand kind of holding them up in front of me and feeling them before trying them on I noticed that the James purse almost looked like it flared out at the body but this shirt which when you lay a flat is completely straight down you can actually see that it's a lot tighter around here but looser around the waist area which can kind of create a weird like bunching up effect and make your stomach look bigger than it actually is and the James purse one the way that it's constructed kind of prevents that from happening just an interesting thought I feel like this shirt is like meant to be kind of tucked in and cropped a little bit like this looks perfect basically but this one is just super thick and high-quality like it's not sure at all it's completely opaque and this is the same price as the H&M one right now cuz these are currently on sale and they do sales for these like literally all the time it's usually the same price as the Tzar ones like 1790 I think right now it's like 990 but this one is like clearly a level up from the Zara and H&M ones in terms of quality so definitely a good one you guys picked a good one state wise I'm gonna give this up four out of five I think this is like a really good classic t-shirt fit but it's almost so straight that when it actually goes on like a body I feel like it like I just don't like how it's tight here and loose here you know quality wise I think this is definitely like up there with the James purse I'm gonna give this a five in terms of quality this is the thickest out of all the five t-shirts it's also really really soft and the stitching and the seams are just really good for this and it's very symmetrical value-wise I have to give this a 5 out of 5 because value wise this is just like one of the best so far since they do sales on this all the time this actually ends up being one of the most inexpensive of the five different t-shirts and since it's so high on the quality bar like I think you really can't go wrong with a t-shirt like this so this one gets a really high score for me and I totally agree with you guys alright guys the unica one was pretty darn close to perfect and the total score I gave it was a 14 out of 15 so these are how the rankings compare I think you can't go wrong with the Uniqlo one that's the one that I would absolutely recommend and then if you have the budget and you want to splurge a little bit more get the James purse one because it's really good so that is it guys that is testing my subscribers favorite white t-shirt please let me know your thoughts in the comments I really want to hear your opinions and give me suggestions for what you want me to do next because I love it this series and I think it's really helpful ok and that is it I love you guys so much and I'll see you in my next video bye", "AcXIhqvssdE": "[Music] answer me there i beat you to it people throw the word grifter around a lot so i figured it's probably best to actually talk about what it means from a historical point of view the root of the word comes from graft which appeared around the 15th century in botanical context you know like grafting plant shoots and such through the botanical influence by the 19th century the maximum amount of soil you could dig up with a shovel or a spade in one scoop was known as that tool's graft and shortly thereafter the act of digging was known as grafting this later generalized to any kind of hard work by 1865 graft was considered a slang term for obtaining profit or advantage by dishonest or shady means especially bribery blackmail or the abuse of a position of power or influence the shift from honest hard work to dishonest tactics that nonetheless still may require hard work to pull off is also attributed to the terms origin in botany grafting techniques of that era often created extra senses in the plants an excresence being a distinct abnormal outgrowth of a living organism that is malformed or diseased in some way the implication is obvious while a graft may require as much effort as honest work it is not actually honest work by the turn of the century grift was considered a diminutive form of graft which is commonly done in the english language by replacing a word's vowel with the letter i a grafter was considered to be somebody who engages in political corruption and a grifter was a small time confidence man or a carnival swindler and while grafter's usage in this way has fallen out of popularity mingling with its botanical and hard-working variants grifter has remained to the present day it currently refers to a person who is willing to say or do anything to make money but not in a positive hardworking context rather in a negative dishonest context they have no problems with lying cheating or stealing they will say things that they explicitly know to be false or they will completely abandon the idea of consistency in their pursuits to be a grifter it helps to be a sociopath but it's not exactly necessary you just have to know how to manipulate people and to make them think they want to give you their money at least long enough for them to actually give it to you boy i knew that english degree would pay off one day uh hit up my subscribe store if you wanna help me pay for it unless you actually consider me a grifter then i guess it's okay but that's the rub isn't it if i were a real grifter and as part of the grift i was trying to create a reputation based on honesty and voluntary action i would say things like here's my donation links guys you don't have to donate if you can't afford it though who knows if i'm being compassionate towards my viewers or i'm just cultivating an image of compassion in order to get paid without actually meaning it who knows what level of the game each of us are playing at the truth is you can't really know a perfect grifter will never let you nowadays if you hang around political youtube you'll notice the terms grift or grifter tossed around quite a bit there's a commie channel called the serfs fitting name considering that's where their ideas lead that really seems to love those terms let's analyze a few examples it's simultaneously hilarious and rage inducing that anyone threw money at this grift said in reference to the lincoln project which is an organization that appeals to the broader left and democrat voters for donations in order to combat trumpism from a righteous position they did so by supporting republicans that while they were anti-trump were still not democrats or leftists are these people grifters i mean maybe they did take money from left-leaning sources who were too dumb to think beyond orange man fascist and never really made it clear where that money was going until they started endorsing anti-trump republicans just a friendly reminder that the free marketplace of ideas is a complete grift set in reference to dave rubin blocking them over some twitter trolling i don't really know about dave rubin being a grifter although joe rogan seems to think he is nowadays kanye was the wrecking machine but i actually think i think in the grand scheme of things candace is much bigger i really believe that in terms of because i think she could be a direct line to all of the political parts of this if she decides to go that route because i think she could i think she could run for senate or what yeah you said you watched the podcast i did with her yeah okay yeah i watch i don't maybe at least an hour and a half of it or so okay yeah why why what well i don't know why are you saying it that way i mean i don't want to name any names but there's a bunch of people that do it blatantly you see them and i've even seen them switch teams and you see them switch teams and i don't buy their rationalizations when it comes to ideology what i think is what they're doing is they're switching teams because they realize there's an inn on this team right and they can just say this is the problem with the team i used to be on those [ __ ] losers and they're really benedict arnold right and like like they probably have as much of an affinity to the ideas of one side as they do the other side they just go all in on one side to get acceptance from the group will you go on joe rogan's podcast and will you have libertarian presidential vp candidate on your show before the election um will i go on rogan's podcast i asked him and our pr people asked him about a bajillion times to go on for my book we did not get a response as far as i know so i don't know what happened there it's a little weird for me to say that publicly i don't know what happened um even if you disagree with the way people feel about so many different things it doesn't mean you can't be their friend it doesn't and i'm telling you we got it wrong here's what's important what's important is whoever that person is they got to be sincere now as soon as you feel like someone's a grifter yeah you've got to cast them out right you've got to cast them out because they're going to figure that out on their own and they got to apologize that's cool man you got listen you can be wrong but you have to be honest and if you're just bullshitting then i can't hang out with you and i gotta say it is kind of funny to see lance regurgitate a repainted so much for the tolerant left style argument so your platitudes were utterly meaningless and you were a grift all along thanks for clearing that up said in anger out of andrew yang supporting biden over bernie so is making moves out of political pragmatism a grift because that's literally what you and every other bread tuber and nearly every other leftist ultimately did when you decided you were riding with biden a few months later i think it's probably funniest to juxtapose these two examples though the joy of being a leftist is wearing your values like a badge instead of a grift in response to tim pool's assertion that some moderates are afraid of speaking about their values publicly due to the far left and your woke grift is tired when paul joseph watson talks about the dominant religions of countries most likely to stone gay people to death i'm sure you've noticed by now the obvious what stands out like a sore thumb when i put these two tweets together according to lance it's a grift when it's somebody he disagrees with politically but it's wearing your values like a badge when it's a fellow lefty nowhere in that extended definition of grifter that i armed you with earlier in the video did i say that its definition is somebody you personally disagree with and yet that seems to overwhelmingly be the way that radicals use the term most of joe rogan's top viewed interviews are grifters now you may disagree with alex jones ben shapiro jordan peterson or stephen crowder but are they really grifters ben shapiro and jordan peterson seem to genuinely believe what they say even if you might disagree with them while alex jones and stephen crowder on some level though obviously not entirely are exaggerating some of what they say for comedic effect when people take sponsorships sell products or plug their patreons is the only criteria for them being a grifter whether or not the accuser agrees with their point of view not if the creator thinks they're telling the truth not if they actually provide the good or service they're selling but is it really all just politics to these people sargon is an excellent example these accusations are a dime a dozen ella will sargon has such an unbelievable grifter all right let's see what they're talking about joe biden likens ted cruz to nazi propaganda's goebbels for helping trump spread big lie about election fraud he's mad that's mad biden not even in office yet he's already calling trump and his administration nazis trump can't even speak back on the allegation because they've torn out his tongue unreal this is this is genocidal rhetoric this is terrible there is it is awful awful what the democrats are doing right now and the thing is with so much power you would think that they would have some kind of grace but instead they've gone into full-on vicious absolutely crush our opponents mode and that's quite terrifying and it shows that it is the left that has been the problem it is the way that they operate in politics they are not tolerant and the problem with not being tolerant is it means you can't run a democracy what is so objectionable about this clip okay you may disagree with what sargon's saying if you think he's wrong fair enough but clearly he believes it and clearly he's speaking to an audience of people who also believe it so if he's delivering the product they're paying for how is it a grift this is like a radical christian saying that an lgbt youtube channel catering specifically to people interested in lgbt ideology is a grift for delivering a product they're advertising that people actually want here's a lengthy criticism of sargon from the now defunct subreddit of chapo trap house and it's clear that they're trying to turn i disagree with sargon politically into some blanket statement about his character and his business this is a man who dropped out of college to scam people out of a video game kickstarter and use that money to run a five-year right-wing grifting project that consists of him [ __ ] on feminist while calling himself a classical liberal not only is this factually inaccurate sargon refunded the money and posted the receipts last i heard it's also one of the most try hard things i've ever read right up there with lol i have more subs and views than you internet clout totally matters you guys let's take this caption remove all of the personal attacks and statements of political difference and see what criticisms actually remain nothing he said ever provided an idea concept or solution to modern problems he's never said anything useful besides sjw's bad he's never provided a radical idea that can change the world unlike reuter bregman and richard wolff on the left or jordan peterson and andrew yang on the right andrew yang on the right nothing he said has provided valuable discourse etc etc it basically boils down to two points one sargon has never proposed a solution to the problems he points out and two all the problems he points out are sjw's bad even for back when this was written i don't think this was the case but nonetheless if you are legitimately an anti-sjw individual selling anti-sjw content and your viewers are all anti-sjws looking for that content how is this a grift when a radical calls somebody who's in the mainstream center you know the liberals the conservatives grifters they're generally not saying here is a person lying cheating and stealing saying things they know to be false being hypocritical in order to get paid instead they're saying here is a person presenting ideas i think are false and because i'm obviously correct about everything they are taking money from people for reasons i don't approve of let's swing back to the serfs for one final chuckle anybody who says they're a socialist but isn't comfortable forming a worker co-op or as a progressive who has stole the virtues of worker rights and refuses to let their workers unionize is a grifter why yes i do agree lance this is why literally everybody laughed when vosh said his business did not have to be a worker co-op including myself check out my old eat the rich video on that topic if you like now i don't believe the serfs are grifters they might say a lot of dumb [ __ ] all the time but i actually think they probably believe it however who knows if they're actually living it in general if you're a radical you're also more likely to be a hypocrite yes the number of male feminists who are forcefully respecting women with their penis is truly astounding yes the number of cult leaders and mega church pastors who live hedonistic lives seems to be basically 100 and yes progressives and neo-socialists who spout rhetoric about wanting the workers revolution while exploiting everybody around them as hard and fast as they can just seems to be the thing that bread tube does this realization was the center of the most recent debate between vosh and destiny where philosophy tube was raking in [ __ ] tons of money online keeping her income private when a common lefty line of thought is that the expectation that incomes are kept private is one way that bosses keep workers in line by preventing them from comparing their pay all the while encouraging people way less well-off than her to go on rent strikes and other stuff like this if it sounds hypocritical that's because it is and vosh defended her in such a way that he basically revealed himself to be somebody not interested in truth or even socialism at all on some level but only raw power no really listen to this i try to live my principles and i think that it would be unethical for me to maximize my existence in a capital society i've turned on a lot of money for stuff that would maximize my existence in couples because i think it's unethical to do so i don't agree that like because it doesn't further what i believe in and it doesn't further what turned down i've turned down a ton of [ __ ] gambling sponsorships there was so much money flying around and the cs go skin days there was so much of that [ __ ] that i [ __ ] turned down so you've turned okay good and you've turned down and i for my part have turned down every sponsorship because why it's not a part of my aesthetic i don't want to okay wait then don't make those things the same don't don't wait wait don't compare that to me okay you're on a lower level there okay i intentionally no no no no no no no no no no no no no hold on hold on hold on hold on i intentionally have foregone money that i could use otherwise because it is in accordance with my principles okay you're not doing it because it doesn't fit the aesthetic that you sell on your youtube channel that comparison to me was insulting because i don't not take certain sponsorships because of my aesthetic i do it because of my principles those two things are very different that's what upset me do you understand when i said when i said aesthetic i suppose you wouldn't buy me saying as a lefty i don't like the idea of um doing leg work for corporations to advertise products that i don't give a [ __ ] about but you would say that's walking back because what i actually believe is that it's purely an aesthetic flourish and me flushing it out now that i realize you've been made upset by my language is the thing is is what i would say is i wouldn't believe you i don't believe that i don't buy that okay i know i know you do but that's no it's because the first response is the is the most likely to be the honest one and this there are plenty of like higher order things that could be [ __ ] with our ability to understand yes that's true right okay so if you acknowledge that and you're a moral anti-realist so there is actually no choice of the matter which theory of truth is right then you also acknowledge that any empirical statement i make is also arbitrary um i mean i think it would be arbitrary insofar as we would have to disagree on like the meaning of truth but i think that most people have subscribed to the idea that truth means something that could be empirically verified if a person disagreed with that i would have to kill them there's no truth that they're nothing is objective nothing is true or it's all relative to what someone wants yeah everything but i do think you can make an empirical statement about that depends on you wait yes the morality of the holocaust depends on your subject whether it happened sure if you have a different definition of truth then yeah but if a person can say that they're wrong they're just oh no well i don't have to say that they're wrong all i have to do is convince them right now you are basically saying that uh i would disagree with them i would try to convince them you would disagree with them but you have to acknowledge from this you know yes i acknowledge that i've always acknowledged that yeah it's about power you are so you are you're in a state of complete nihilism about the world no one's positioning is more specified than another inherently no correct wow okay so you're literally incomplete so actually right now if i wanted to i could flip a coin and if it lands heads or tails i'm correct about this issue and you have no way to refute what i just said empirically no but i could argue that that's dumb wow well it doesn't matter i mean if you just acknowledge all you do is just scream at people to make you feel good wait yeah wait fine wait no i don't wait i don't scream at people so you don't you don't care about truth in the world i guess wait yeah i do i care about my truth in the world yeah yeah you care about how you feel yeah yes because all moral positions are downstream of our subjective emotional preferences how many times do i have to refrain this no no i just it's crazy to me hearing you say it like two plus two equals four right there there are multiple theories of truth something can be true because it's actually existing in the world right which is probably what you view truth as you know the cup is read is true if it is actually okay there's another theory of truth it could be something is true if and only if it makes me feel good right my question to you would then be well which of those theories of truth should i adopt it depends on which moral system you subscribe to if you subscribe to a different one and that causes me that theories of truth are moral statements all of thought is just power grabs between people who can decide subjectively whether or not their positions are better than all power grabs unironically wow in some cases of whether the holocaust happened a paragraph yes and this the thing unlike mob rule i don't believe i can't believe you think that there's no way that you do not feel i've applied a consistent standard where i think it's more moral to just submit yourself to the mob that it is to just kill everyone who comes for you i if i've submitted a consistent standard i don't think it's fair for you to accuse me of being in bad faith it is consistent maybe that's how people feel when they argue against me and i'm consistent or something maybe you genuinely do believe that i guess it's possible but yeah obviously in the future because because i can think of a lot of scenarios that are really sweats to the where [ __ ] black dudes have been lynched by white people thinking they were in the right where saying that like well but then you even said earlier maybe the black guy should just submit himself to get arrested and then they can happen yeah wait wait if people are coming to arrest the black guy then yeah i think that he should submit to arrest rather than gunning down a bunch of unarmed white people not submit to arrest but like a mob of white people approaching him really depends on the context there and how legitimate the lethal threat is and this let's say that there are 10 people okay they're gathered on the beach unfortunately today there is a lost soul okay he's a hundred meters out this guy is [ __ ] and none of the people on the beach they're not good enough swimmers to go get him okay now let's say another guy walks by okay this guy is called chad marks okay some people call him charles marks okay this guy is a [ __ ] state champion swimmer and he walks by and he sees that kid out there do you think that that guy with his additional means with all that he has available to him do you think that it would be just as morally neutral for him to stand by and watch that person drown as the other 10 less capable people on that beach could he simply say i mean i don't have like an obligation it would be good if i did but like i mean i could just sit here and watch it happen i don't think it's bad this is morally neutral if i sit here watching if he has the means otherwise he's analogous no no okay i should go out and save the person okay why is that disanalgus okay because if that they decided not to do that thing if they decided to abstain it would cost a person their life whereas in the case of a lefty opening a business their decision to open it would not add any negative utility to the world so in that case we're talking about for a lefty it's either you abstain and you have nothing or you participate and you have nothing assuming you don't do extra bad direction okay good that's not really material to the chest swimmer if they abstain you have a death and if they participate you have that that's not that's not at all material participation and abstinence in these two examples met very different outcomes well participation in a morally righteous way and the swimming one could result in saving somebody's life participation in a righteous way in the economic sense could be you opening a business that improves the material conditions of multiple other workers and families i think those are compromised i think that'd be great okay abstinence in one sense is you just stand by and you watch a person drown and abstinence which is negative and abstinence in the business sense is you just stand by and you watch another business open up and exploit workers which would be neutral but the death is negative how is that okay i never ever ever want you to say again that like capitalism is negative or business owners are bad because you understand my argument enough time i guess not because you've bit the neutral bullet on basically every single actor in a capitalist system i i'm sorry if there's some irreconcilable difference that we're not going to resolve here then we might as well not waste an additional hour on it if you acknowledge that when a lefty opens a business and let's say pays market rates same as everyone else and the workers are treated fine really middle of the road as hard as that is to abstract all you are doing in a purely empirical sense is giving local workers an additional choice uh uh an additional place that they could sell their labor to an unethical institution unfortunate but you're not compelling or mandating or directing any direct harm if you didn't do that there would be no benefit but if you have the means to do now if you have the means to act in a way that's more accordance and more no if you have the means to act in harmony with your principles then for you to do less i genuinely think that your perspective on this issue has been tainted or corroded in some way by the people that you've argued online if it's been tainted or corroded by anything it's by the fact that i went to a jesuit high school and what part of what we taught i guess was like that you should live your principles if you still have any delusions about whether or not vosh believes what he's saying or really any other bread tuber who parrots his rhetoric i hope this puts them to bed this is what a grifter actually is when you openly nakedly say that truth does not exist beyond what you can twist people into believing that winning is more important than being correct that the appearance of being anti-corporate is more important than living your principles there is no more clear example of a grifter than that the problem with the grifter worldview that vash exposes is that eventually reality will snap back it does not matter how many laborers or scientists or engineers that soviet commissar vosh brow beats into submission if you don't adhere to objective real world truth at some point you're gonna get chernobyl out of your nuclear program you can scream that two plus two doesn't equal four as much as you want but the mushroom cloud forming over the ruins of your project does not care and while that is an extreme comparison this sort of thing happens all the time when you ignore the truth what happened to ethan ralph andy warski mr metaker channel awesome game grumps or any other youtube channel or online personality that ignored the truth in favor of grifting hoping their popularity would allow them to skate on by they're all shadows of their former selves and that will be where vash finds himself sooner or later the reason grifters have to keep leaving town eventually and move on is because the people they swindle inevitably catch up to them the act of grifting makes enemies of your own audience the very people that pay you you can't run away from that forever the clap back will come for vosh and the rest of bread tube in due time and just like it did with ralph with warski medicare channel awesome and game grumps i

Paul Minnesota and today we're going to talk about cotton t-shirts if you've ever looked at t-shirts you'll probably notice that there are a ton of options in this video I'm gonna help you decipher what kind of t-shirt would be best for you by giving you a few details about each of our favorite cotton t-shirt the first t-shirt I'd like to talk about it's no frills it's your basic t-shirt it's the Gildan G 5000 this t-shirt is made out of standard cotton it's affordable it's got a boxier fit and it's got a ton of color options to choose from the next t-shirt is the Gildan soft style G 64,000 this shirts a little bit nicer than your G 5000 it's got a semis fitted feel to it so it's not as boxy shirt was made sure where it still has a ton of color options and it's a little bit softer and more durable because it's a ring spun cotton next we'll move up to the anvil 980 this t-shirt is also made by Gildan who owns anvil this shirt is a comb ring spun cotton t-shirt it's a sin I fit it as well it's very similar to the soft style but it's kind of in-between the soft styles and then the later shirts I'm going to talk about alright next I would like to talk about the next level 3600 this is definitely one of our most popular fashion fit t-shirts the next level uses the combed ring spun cotton so it's a very soft durable t-shirt this shirt is going to cost you a little bit more it's also got less color options and the other shirts we're going to talk about today next level they run a little small you definitely hugs me real a lot tighter than the other shirts so this shirt I would maybe consider going up a size another fashion fitted t-shirt that's very popular is the Bella canvas 3000 one one thing that's really nice about the Dahle canvas is although they are also manufactured overseas like all of the shirts were talking about today the dialogues where they actually dye the colors of the shirts are done here in one factory in California this helps them keep a very consistent color between all their t-shirts the Bella canvas is another fashion fitted tee they come out with all kinds of great colors all the time they're very soft it's a cone ring spun cotton or they call it an heirloom combed ring spun cotton and it's another great option if you're looking for a fashion fitted t-shirt and finally we'll talk about the American Apparel 2001 they got two options one of them is made overseas the other one is made here in America which will cost you extra with American Apparel you're paying for that brand name even though Gildan now owns american apparel american apparel is another fashion fitted teeth it's a combed ring spun cotton supersoft they've got a lot of color options so of course they're very nice shirts as well the point is there's a ton of different options to choose from so you've got to decide what's right for you it depends on your fit what kind of feel you're going for and of course your price point and if you're looking to have t-shirts made stop over to Twin Cities com fill out a quote form and we'll get you set up as always thanks for watching and we'll see you in the next video [Music] I'm sorry Dan it's really hard when you're not here you stupid stop", "QrydxYUt-Q8": "[Music] my butt very kind of basic next match today you can actually guys you can never go wrong in these colors the mix people all black all by very denim intended they just blend in soldier together that's why I prefer having clothes in these colors because it's a lot easier to do a size so here are some outfit ideas that you can wear after Brian D and are at home reading this so for the first outset I'm just wearing an acid-wash jeans which is actually suited for me I didn't feel like wearing a bug so I decided to do this method instead that I learn together yeah you learn more stuff simpler than in real life jaar anywhere as you can see the fit looks better now even without a bug I do like method most of the time because i have really small range so buying Jean's it's a perfect fit for me it's really a struggle and that's already a smaller size and it's obviously but yeah I feel very bad and was holding the answer my jeans price for about an inch or so but it's a bunch in the length of your jeans and what do you think is the best fit for you then I just added some accessories warm each other more advanced tights and friend and a small backpack bag to complete the look [Music] oh by the way you can turn this backpack is a slingback [Music] for the second upset I'm going all black with the soup just from hmm with a really cute I am instructs earth I don't know but yeah I'm just tucking it in to make it look better and I really like this linking up because a soup top and these news fans makes the outfit elegant and simple I usually pair it with black coffees or with this company sandals it's about two inches long on heels so it's a big thumbs up for me because it's not the struggle to walk in these and it adds to my height so yay and that completes the second look but if you don't have something like those loose black pants we can always wear it with high rates into the seams and the store shoes or sneakers [Music] [Music] the next option is my overall favorite look from this video because it looks really neat and aesthetic and it's also combinations because not a lot of people wear all white but I got my top from forever 21 in the answer from a beach shoe section in the department store which I got years ago from a beach trip and who would have thought that it could also appear as a casual outfit nasty for my sandals they're the same as the previous black ones that i got from to the gun [Music] [Applause] I said number four in this after them going been even letting me buzz for not I'm wearing a highway straight from Lebanon which I really love because it's on except for small signs which fits me perfectly when apparent in the tube drop denim jacket and the super small steam bag that position anything from [Music] instrumental spell infect you also the completion look I added some accessories such as primer earring and warmer hi Bob Congress and fellow athletes [Music] the next look is my go-to outfit when I go to the moss or something because it's very comfortable wearing sweat pants and bearing into the cup top makes a little more extra also I use another small backpack in the color lilac permitted us to contrast the darkness of my all-black outfit I don't know why I'm just a fan of small flats even if what I did say but Bhutan close to me but yeah I like it for 13 teeth and little better sentiments for the sixth outfit idea it's a common fashion random guy from Korean inspired outfits which I didn't really like at first because it looks weird but actually when you get the right pieces to match such as compatible colors and prints it turns out to be a really cute outfit and now I can't get over how to hit the sleeves [Music] next is also one of my favorite outfits like if you follow me on instagram and wear these kind of outfits almost at the time because I really like it and it looks cool the rules that I made for this look is that then the shortest Dallas offer then for we only merciful as a lower which is sexy tops and response since of course chicks gonna like ironing a look I fed you through the tough part to make it look more sheet and work happened I also got the same fans injury and these are the answers that they came of it outfit number eight but we usually get scolded for those perfec short stead of fear yes finally I found the perfect shorts that are not too sexy and fits me well he liked most of the short strip before Nikita is a victim of around pink goo Sakura Sakura the smaller in size than the shorter side but finally these shorts are a must for me because they look like as well and simple life in park is any top and still look elegant or something I got three Schwarz in create black white and also a chocolate brown one that I didn't have compare in this video but yeah I made sure to get a lot of basic colors K as I have said it makes it a lot easier to yourself [Music] second to the last of the dishes basically wearing an oversized shirt and tucking it in in some trousers or any other plans that aren't Ian's because it looks better exactly after tucking it in make sure to pull some of the cloth on all sides to make it more comfortable and pleasing lastly it's a big no-no without his laser investor they got from the hormones last business of construction into department stores and as you can see if maybe after any fluid and comfortable compared to how it was earlier the land of a blazer truly coverage about section of matures which makes me really conscious because of the fact that shirt that I'm wearing but thanks to the laser disc off let you see see see [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] she's a Manas", "LFyRo7ycDxU": "Hey guys I'm Summer from Bella + Canvas\nand we've spent years educating customers on the different types of cotton. Do you know\nthe difference between carded open-end ring-spun and heirloom combed and ring-spun?\nIf not in this video will be extremely useful for you. We're gonna compare how a\nscreen print and DTG print perform on these three types of cotton. Cole from\nShirt Agency is gonna show us how these different types of cotton print\nbut before we get started we just want to explain the differences in these\nqualities of cotton. So first you have your card at open end, your card at open\nend is your cheap scratchy heavier t-shirt? Yeah and then from there a lot\nof our retail customers have moved on to ring-spun because it has a much smoother\nsurface. And the next step up from ring spun is your heirloom combed and ring\nspun. And with ring-spun you can comb out one percent and still call it combed and\nring spun. But we actually comb out about 25 percent of the cotton that we start\nwith because it contains impurities that we don't want in that finished product.\nAnd we also only use long staple cotton which has a huge effect on the final\nresult so you end up with the smoothest printing surface possible. Yeah we\nabsolutely love printing on your guy's garments we get a really nice hand and\nfeel and our prints are really sharp. Today we're gonna show the comparison on\nthese three types of cotton that we talked about with a DTG print a plastisol print and discharge print so let's go see the results. So we have our\nplastisol prints hot off the press what are we looking at here? Well the\nmain thing good check out is on the carded open end when you look through\nthe loop you can see all the different fibers affecting the texture of the last\nscreen printing. And then obviously when you touch it with your hand it's got a\nrougher finish. Yeah you can definitely see some of the red fibers coming\nthrough mm-hmm. And moving on to the ring-spun one it is a little bit better but\nit's not necessarily like the best it could be. There's a little bit of\nfibrillation still happening and that's causing a little bit of a hand feel. And\nwhen you move on to the heirloom it's basically just a completely sharp\nfinished surface and on your hand it feels extremely smooth. So next we'll\nlook at our discharge print how does discharge differ from plastisol?\nSo with discharge instead of putting the ink on top like plastisol. We're\nactually removing the dye from the garment. So this to be honest isn't so\nmuch about the fibers anymore. This is about the quality of the dye and the\nquality of the base garment. So you can see with the heirloom we got a pretty\nclean sharp result with the discharge and then moving on to the ring-spun it's\na pretty similar result but we got a little bit more of the blue staying\nthrough it doesn't look like the true discharge. And then carded open-end\nnormally means that it's like a cheap shirt so we got a really nasty color on\nthis one which was a bit of a surprise. And I think that comes down to the\nquality of the dyes that they're using. Yeah how you dye the shirts is just as\nimportant as how you knit the shirt. So at bella canvas we dye everything in LA so\nwe can main that level of consistency and basically match all of our colors so\nyou have this quality when you have your discharge print. Alright and the third\nprint we did was a DTG or a direct to garment print. So what do you want to\nlook for in a shirt when DTG printing? Well the problem with direct to garment\nfor us pretty much all the time is with brightness. And so we had a pretty great\nresult with the heirloom cotton compared to the carded open-end. I think a lot of\nthat has to do with the tightness of the weave and the ink kind of falling into\nthe fabric. So with DTG it's more important than the other types of screen\nprinting to have a super tight knit weave since the ink lays on top of the\nfabric. Yeah and you already have such a high ink cost what DTG that your product\ncan't be sold for very cheap. And since you're not gonna be doing promo with DTG\nI would think that it makes sense to almost exclusively use a nicer ring spun\nor airlume t-shirt. Hope you guys enjoyed this video.

Be Different.", "iD00Y8QTdfE": "[Music] what is going on guys so right now we are at the mall and we are going to be trying to find the best white t-shirt 428 bucks and we're gonna take everything into consideration the price the quality and the fit yes sir and there can only be one winner at the end of the video let's go see what we find [Music] alright guys so right now we're noon aglow these t-shirts right here the supima kind crewneck t-shirts you know I don't want to make my decision right now but I've heard really great things about these t-shirts they are kind of pricey though we're looking at 1490 because they offer 100% greater cut oh hold on hold on anything rare you know I'm I'm big on the high prayer cotton but if you guys want something a little bit thicker a little bit more rugged for the same price they also have these right here the you crewneck t-shirts and here is a white one we're also going to get this and check it out as well [Music] alright guys so right now we are in Northland which carries top man these are their white tees right here right off the bat kind of thin collar is pretty thin as well but you know never judge a book by it's cover ten bucks you also got a Romani dollar option gonna get a more premium one little rough heavier but not as heavy it looks like oversize kind of yeah all right so we got a twenty dollar option and a ten dollar option from Topman let's get both alright so I went over to other two tees but I just came across the classic elongated tee if you asked me these are out especially for $30 okay I know they had its run but it's done I don't wanna see these no more any stores all right is this for beheads sorry man sorry I know we're on the search for the best white team but you know I saw this photo right here these gummy bears go for him you got try these this is like it turns up versatile sweet energy good texture on point it's not as hard as only one but I will do good though alright guys so we just ran into our friend Joe Nessie right here can you show us what you're wearing man wow she's in Chicago ones they're gonna love you alright see if it's too messy alright guys so last time we did the hoodie video man we went really hard on H&M you know we step foot back in here they've actually stepped it up in the cleanliness Department I don't know if they got the big boss coming through but everything looking clean it is super clean right now alright so the infamous H&M white see right here $6.99 $5.99 so $6.99 you're okay with that little bump oh cool alright $6.99 we got to get the classic H&M whitey let's see what they're working with alright guys so we just got back from the mall mayor behind us alright we got seven of the best white t-shirts out right now I'm gonna be putting on each one and we are gonna determine what is the best affordable white t-shirt out that money can buy let's get into it alright let's get started alright guys so right now I am rocking a size medium in the supima cotton Uniqlo standard t-shirt all right oh supima very very high quality cotton it's soft alright I'm not gonna like kinda have like sensitive skin a little bit yesterday you always oh you always bring that up when you wear t-shirt I can't do the Forever 21's fan I do that like I would pay that extra few bucks for something soft like this let's go over to fit real quick you know looking outside in a little bit above the elbow yes sir you know it does give it a little bit of a muscle tee by but not too tight not I couldn't have even said it better not too tight but it does hug around you know the bike don'ts a little buzz but as far as the fit of the t-shirt man I would say it does have like a relaxed / loose fit I made this for everyday wear this is actually the t-shirt that I wear pretty consistently they wash really nicely they don't wrinkle up in the neck area and we're not I say these are not bad at all good but I say we move on to you know clothes other thick white underside of the offer all right sorry let's get into that one so next t-shirt that I'm rocking right now is the Uniqlo 14.90 as well crew neck t-shirt so right off the bat this one is thick the hand feel right of the bat gives it more like an aged kind of a rougher hand field and you know most of the rather regular softer ones yeah I like that personally I like that rest of the vintage t-shirt I was gonna say I don't really like how like basically feels like a rough canvas you know what I mean but one thing we also have to bring up is basically like everyday wear this t-shirt right here is something that you're gonna wear on its own this one definitely gives off more of a boxy or vibe which is kind of more of my style when it comes to street wear the other one is you know a little bit too standard you know more for menswear kind of like off a mess you're teaching men's fashion kind of that style so if you're willing to compromise on the comfort a little bit then you roll with this one basically it all comes down to preference all right so right now I am rocking the infamous HCM $6.99 white t-shirt everybody had this shirt or all the other ten colors or twenty close offers they have a lot all right so all right off the bat man I'm not gonna lie these things are hugging nope I feel it's gonna say these are so small this is definitely more muscle surgery you don't need to have muscles and though you'll seem like you have my finger people like so right off the bed as far as the fit goes it is more on the smaller side of more a little bit more fitted for sure I mean I could almost see your whole bicep first it wasn't a little bit about the elbow yeah now it's all mostly a deltoid yeah so that's what you're gonna get as far as the fit goes and then now we got to talk about the quality it is pretty thin a way thinner than the first one yes sir and it kind of just tells you the quality of fabric may not be as good I mean when you're like even looking at the stitching and everything there's loose threads and I mean like the density of the fabric is what I'm looking at right now it is actually kind of thin and one thing you cannot you know determine from an eye test with these H&M t-shirts is after a wash so pretty much after you wash these and dry these it's just that's it yeah you're more you're you're you're caller just turns it to a bacon these turn like basically five times smaller so these are good for one wear basically and we have said this over and over on the channel for $6.99 that might seem like a good deal but if you pay like extra bucks you know for your noona clothes or your top man and t-shirts and whatnot you are gonna get longevity you can actually keep the shirt you're gonna be able to keep the shirt definitely do not recommend getting these for a few extra bucks you can get something much better yes sir alright so next up man I am rocking the top man standard white t-shirt this comes in at $10 from Nordstrom what do you think of this look you said the keyword standard not too loose not too tight okay I gotta compare this one to the to the first Utica one oh very comparable yes I got to ask you that comfort for five dollars less this is worth it I would say you know like you said I'm kind of sure I like this - Peet makan this is exactly the same no standard fit they probably cut it from the exact same template but the fabric he's not gonna offer it it's a little rougher okay and you know I stand by the Uniflow ones they do hold up really well and I can't really speak for the top man when it comes to washing I say we move on to the next top man t-shirt though this one is coming in at $20 alright so right now I am rocking the $20 top man t-shirt so this one is completely different more comparable to the crew neck t-shirt that I was wearing from Uniqlo I was gonna say has a vibe for me when it comes to a white tee I'm gonna rock it more flowy okay I'm gonna rock it we're gonna without anything over it out I got again so that's the look I'm trying to get that's why I like this t-shirt I like a Uniqlo one okay okay what about you for myself if I'm gonna rock a shirt like this you know loose and flowy it's gonna have some logos the logos and we're not so branded white t-shirts I just never seen white t-shirts as like a main piece so for that reason I wouldn't personally buy this white t-shirt but I could see if you do like that drape here flowy vibe this is much better to wrap this one up if you're looking for oversized shirt for $20 it's not bad this is the one you're gonna get my hair for top minute alright so moving right along we got a goody fellow white t-shirt right here from Target sorry the house brand this one is only six dollars the cheapest sand t-shirt on dollar list so far I'm not gonna lie right off the bat this looks not bad at all it doesn't look that out oh oh one thing that I got a really bring up as far as the quality goes is it kind of has this like almost like it was tumbled in like super soft fabric softener or something more soul about it okay yeah so right on the bat comfort you like it a lot really soft but as first the feet goes it's a [ __ ] to muscley for my like yeah I mean it does compared to the again hmm one where it's almost to your bicep yeah and the collar is very thin I can't see from here probably the thinnest one so far so a lot of people associate thinner collars which actually with more of like menswear premium okay so maybe that's what they're trying to go forward I don't think I don't think a Goodfella brand is a in street wear yet for six dollars mm-hmm if you're gonna compare to the H&M one I would just go cross street for them all no Target and get the good fellow yeah this is a shinobi a noir and you're gonna save a dollar you're gonna save a dollar and it's actually better yourself it's wrap this one up I say go with this one let's move on to the next one alright so last but not least right in front of us we got the Hanes what they claim is their premium pack right here we're looking at 70 shirts for $25 which comes out to what $3.57 to be exact oh my gosh they had a nerve to throw in an extra one guy used to be six okay but they're like you know what just one extra one they're seven sorry so this guy put this look at this collar the way it's not even like it's not even stitched correctly it's kind of weird as a cleaning I can't even it's crazy you wear this usually you look sloppy I really wanted to do this review to just basically should we just stamp never get a Hanes product ever well I was gonna say I mean not the move we try to even go for the premium line earlier there's one that's even worse than this I guess and there's nothing premium about it the fit the look I can almost see your nipples and it yeah it's I don't know it's it's pretty bad I'm not gonna lie when I was younger it was three levitates all about their branding man I used to gravitate towards D that's okay cool good deal you have an ice pack but once you open it up this is what you're gonna get right here as far as fit goes to it looks horrendous this is a work that I wanna do like short on the sleeves yeah super long on the bottom we are saying nowadays people make way better t-shirts I mean the Goodfellow one for five bucks $2 50 more going alright guys so we reviewed a bunch of white t-shirts today we didn't when it comes down to the official white t-shirt that we recommend the best white t-shirt out there I would go with the supima cotton Uniqlo standard tees $15 you getting to comfort the look the quality and you could wash it numerous times I've had them for years so let's go when it stands the test of time which i think is super important yes I recommend that one what about you I'm gonna go with look I thought it was gonna be the Uniqlo kunuk one the fit wise they didn't really like it that's why I'm gonna go with the $20 top man one oh okay cuz that one has the same feel Yanik it has like a little rough feel to it definitely has to look down of the vintage vibes and the oversized fit so i'ma go with that one right there okay that's not bad top so it all just to different preferences of what type of look we would like alright guys that's pretty much it for the finding the best white t-shirt video let us know down the comments below what white t-shirts you guys are currently rocking right now and one thing I also got to bring up too when it comes to the Uniqlo t-shirts I actually size up in a lot of them okay so the medium is a little bit tighter but in my closet right now actually wear a large in those supima cotton so just keep that in mind if you guys are curious but that's pretty much it man make sure you guys are sub to the channel make sure you guys like this video and until next time we out please", "Ue0_AsqOEA0": "hey this is Tom with the father's workshop screen-printing and what we're gonna do we've got something in the mail that we want to check out and it's for putting sublimation on t-shirts not Polly t-shirts but gah so you don't come back right after the intro [Music] [Music] hey Tom the father's workshop screen-printing and we're here again and we're making another video and I don't know if you like him or not if you like to mother to that we made but anyways we're not real big on videos but anyways we're gonna we're gonna do something today we got some stuff from a company and we're not advertising unless you want to sanitize for you but we we got some stuff and it's it's from a company called Dai France and we we bought some stuff because we're curious about sublimation on garments now it's nice when you can put a nice graphic on garments by just using your heat press because I mean I have I have I have other graphics and stuff that you can actually heat press on to the car but this is something that we can print with our printer with the sublimation ink and be able to have a nice graphic and hopefully it would come out nice on shirt now I have heard that it really worked good now this is a little bit of a process because first of all you've got to use the the Desai's are on white and gray shirts to get the decides are out of it that they put into it it has to do with something when they when they're doing this church when they're making the shirts knitting the church or whatever it is it has something to do with with with with that process but they take the D sizer out it is it's removed when they put the ink in them so your your blue shirts and your yellow shirts and your orange green all your colored shirts don't have the D sizer and I'm so you don't have to go through this process but then once you've done that once you if you're gonna do a white shirt once you gather these sides are out of it then you have to use the the other chemical that you spray on there let it dry put in your heat present cure it spray it again cure it again and then you can put your sublimation graphic on to the garment onto the cotton garment so this is sublimation ink on cotton shirts and I have supplemented on cotton without you know without without this stuff and I know what it looks like and you got to be particular when you do it you can do it you still put that on yours on the shirt but it's it's it's it's really kind of blurry faded it comes out but it just it's not crisp but you know hey that you want say a nice clean crisp image it's not like that if you don't use this stuff I guess because I haven't used it yet and what I say haven't used it yet is is it's this stuff right here still on a package haven't even open it yet now this is the B sizer this is what you use on the white and gray shirts you put that on there and there's a process to make sure that you do that then once you've done that and you finished that process then you use what's known as this and it's the poly tea spray anyways just a bottle without a sprayer but this is a probably teach spray anyways and this is it's as concentrated so it'll make up as it's eight ounces should make up to 64 ounces I think it's seven ounces per ounce so that's the way it works what we're gonna do that so come back let's see how it does let's see how it works [Music] [Music] [Music] everything's gonna go [Music] it drops of spray on there now today we're back in this morning time and my Chinese food was great all right we have the heat press getting warmed up and we've went ahead in time to 10 seconds because we need to press this shirt now now that we wet it last night we let it dry overnight come back out here to the shop and I'm going to do now is let the heat press get hot when it gets hot we will press it I think it says for 10 seconds then I've got my he press yet for 10 seconds once it goes down and then we'll bring it back up and we'll take it back over to the platen over here and spray it again and maybe we'll go throw it out in the dryer and let it dry quicker so we can get that second coating on there and you know going to get the second Curie and then we can go ahead and see how this stuff works we're gonna print some up on our printer [Music] only say what said sure did you do yes last night I didn't do front of the back battle I'll just press both sides and I'll have to spray both sides I'm just kidding [Music] [Music] way and then we know that we've sprayed all of this so we'll take these depressed and it is set 385 degrees and we depress it for 10 seconds [Music] offensive ten-second charity thing not again anyway I went a little funk see that smoke I'm assuming that that is the D sizer not the sizer for that is the puck I seem that the smoke there is quality I don't want a bunch of spots all over my shirt [Music] that means we have to [Music] now we're gonna take the shirt we gon spray it again again now what I need to do now that I've done the two cures I've sprayed it let it dry now I'm doing then I did two cures what I'm gonna do now is we're going to put our picture sublimation ink and I did this I run this put together there on the computer there is we gonna put it on the shirt and it says to use butchers paper I'm I don't get that yeah I know I know I need to put something in between where the shirt is here so when you open up the inside of the shirt because that's what's gonna happen is it breaks into a gas so it's naturally gonna go through the material now I don't know if this poly tea is supposed to stop that but I'm gonna put something in between there anyways just to check and see maybe that's why the butchers paper for I have I have some Teflon paper I have up sheets that I put on and so we'll go that route on as far as put it over the top so anyway let's let's just go ahead and work with this thing and see what it looks like so I'm dying to see how it's gonna look now that I've got it it sure twice let me take these glasses off now I can I can see them reading glasses okay so we're gonna go ahead and put this on on the shirt put it on the shirt I think all we're gonna do we're not let me let me let me get the camera set up and we'll come back just hang on okay we're back you had to get the camera set up I hate that's over the cameras and and I'm using a cheap camera anyway so anyways what we've got here now me let me direct down here [Music] [Music] [Music] now this says this says we're supposed to [Music] get our feet press in a 385 degrees and we're supposed to press it for 70 seconds so I'll get that ready in just a second what I'm gonna do open this up [Music] [Music] I went to break into a gas it doesn't bleed through and [Music] [Music] thanks but when you got pictures like this it's kind of crooked anyways so if you put it on there little bit crooked it ain't gonna make any difference [Music] try to get a straight from cans [Music] I do what I need units I need to set this 70 seconds [Music] [Music] here we don't put it on there upside down set it up on shirt [Music] [Music] drop this all for 70 seconds [Music] I can notice temperature dropped you see that [Music] and that's gonna happen who says 70 seconds is up that seemed awfully quick only a few more seconds because the heat dropped and when it did it didn't maintain that no that's really why I set the temperatures a little higher can see it still it's 372 degrees and so it we didn't exactly press at the temperature so normally I set my temperature is higher so one actually is it cools off but it still does all right here we go [Music] when they say 385 and I'll tell you what man I normally go about 400 degrees [Music] not a real of course it could be mine my friend maybe I didn't turn it out as perfectly as I shut it that was treated [Music] treated a couple of times and like I said it's not supposed to be straight it's supposed to be crooked like that his head supposed to be straight got a nice feel to it where you can feel the regular shirt here the softness this is 10 of May today yeah that's pretty good like I said the purple see this one's got left over after after all that it could be the either idea I left it too long and the purple started to burn which is what your red and stuff will do that they'll actually start turning brown and this did turn a little brown instead of purple so maybe I'll do it again on another shirt and see what happens with that because yeah my my Reds turned a little but I mean I got the donut here but I think that dome that was supposed to be pink and it's red so I think it got too much heat for too long so seventy seconds and the thing about it is now these presses are not always accurate either something else too I wanted you to notice that remember when we put the paper in the middle and put the paper in the middle there because we worried about bleeding through [Music] you look after treating it twice it didn't even bleed through so that's good and actually that's my my purple turned brown and I think like I said because of too much heat but actually I kind of like the brown wool over there because it Ronnie coffee coffee face that's your coffee face I got the face so that's pretty neat I think what I'll do is I'll treat the back for Manila face on now put donut faizon sir that's uses sublimation ink and using a product called poly tea by company : Die Presse and next time next time what we will do we will and this is it this stuff here mixes one ounce with seven ounces of water give you eight ounces of spray and I imagine you can do a lot of stuff with that that's a lot of spray and [Music] stop father's workshop screen-printing and there it is who is what you think get the product spray on the cotton t-shirt let it dry cure it with the heat press doing it to do this repeat that over again and then put your picture on there I'm only experiment with some more I'll get them and sell em on eBay I'll experiment the ones that I experiment with you're still good-looking shirt I'll sell them on eBay so be looking father's workshop screen-printing TF w is screen printing I think it's pretty neat anyway that's that's all for this video so thank you for tuning in and yeah we had to little naughty sometimes but that's just where we are some folks say that we're handicapped from the neck up maybe they're right this is Tom the father's workshop screen-printing and thank you for tuning in and again god bless so until next time [Music] [Music]", "7PaZotmqcgE": "how's it going guys welcome to the starving student reviews today we're going to be talking about the t-shirt a [Music] white t-shirt is something that's very important in everybody's wardrobe it's just a staple that's very versatile something that you can pair with jeans or chinos or pretty much anything else that you have in your closet to me it's kind of like a blank canvas that I can pair with whatever I want I know that all over the internet you can find varying reviews of the best white t-shirt and which one is the best for you but today I thought it would be better to kind of narrow it down to two t-shirts that I have found work very well for me in my wardrobe both of the t-shirts behind me come from the brand Yoona glow which as I've already mentioned is a well known brand for making high quality products at a very affordable price the t-shirt behind me to my left is from Uniqlo U which is a collaboration with the high-end designer Christophe Lamar and is known for its aesthetic and it's high-quality fabric and the one behind me to my right is the Uniqlo supima cotton tee which is known for its soft fill and durability I will be grading these based off of my usual criteria one being the quality construction to being the fit and three being the price so let's get right into it so let's start out with the construction on this Uniqlo you t-shirt this is definitely withstood the test of time as I've had it for over a year and it's had hardly any signs of wear the stitching is very even and uniform throughout and I haven't had any loose threads it's made of a very heavy weight cotton which is very durable and nice if you want to get longevity out of your t-shirt but it definitely doesn't come near to the comfort of the supima cotton t-shirt however I would say in terms of construction this t-shirt wins over the Uniqlo supima cotton t-shirt just because it seems like there was a lot more detail on thought put into the materials and the quality of manufacturing moving on to the construction of the unicloset pima cotton t-shirt i've had this for about six to eight months and it's also held up very well the stitching also seems to be very neat and uniform throughout the garment which makes it drape very nicely and it fits very very well I do think that the Uniqlo supima cotton t-shirt takes the cake the area of comfort the cotton that they use on this t-shirt is very stretchy and very comfortable and just feels almost like a second skin when you're wearing it so that's it for construction now let's move into the price the Uniqlo you t-shirt is a little bit more expensive at $15 whereas the Uniqlo supima cotton t-shirt comes in at just $10 so if you're looking at both of these t-shirts in terms of the price they're definitely very comparable and neither one of them I don't think it's going to break your bank now let's move on to the third category which is the fit and which I think will be the most important factor in deciding which one of these two t-shirts best suits your style the Uniqlo you t-shirt has a very oversized feel to it it has a very thick neck band and has kind of drop shoulders which make it look a little more oversized and it has a very straight cut in the body which makes it drape very loosely but also very comfortably it definitely looks oversized but doesn't look so oversized that it looks baggy or like it doesn't fit I would definitely recommend this for somebody who has more of a stocky build or wants something that drapes more loosely and is more on trend with what's fashionable right at the moment the supima cotton t-shirt on the other hand is a very classic t-shirt it hugs the body everywhere and is pretty slim fitting throughout it definitely fits well on the shoulders I really like that the collar is very close to the neck so it looks very flattering and just overall fits very well and this is definitely what you want to go for if you're a slimmer build or want something that's more timeless and is it is trendy so if I had to choose between these two shirts I would personally go with the Uniqlo supima cotton t-shirt as it is a little bit cheaper and it fits my personal style however I think that they're both a great choice and they're both very affordable and you're getting a lot of value out of your money both of these t-shirts I think are on the top tier of what you can buy in this price range let me know what you think about these t-shirts in the comments and please remember to like and subscribe thanks for watching", "naUBCP5_O9A": "look at this side-by-side photo of these\ntwo tees which is better this one is $2.50 and this one is about $3 so which\none do you buy if you knew the cheaper one would shrink after one wash would\nthat affect your decision we're about to unravel the truth behind what makes a\nt-shirt last for the long haul in this episode of our series ask first them but\nbefore we get into it hit that subscribe button unfortunately shrinkage is common with\nfabrics containing cotton unless manufacturers like bellick canvas take\npreventive measures against it the reason natural fibers like cotton shrink\nis because the fibers want to return to their natural state during the fabric\nmaking process when fibers are spun into thread there's a lot of tension put on\nthe fibers and they stretch out beyond their natural length then when fibers\nare warmed by warm water or a hot dryer during the drying process they try to\nreturn to their original state and in turn cause your clothes to shrink the\nreason that more expensive preshrunk cotton does not shrink in the dryer is\nbecause of a process that takes place during the fabric finishing process\nwhich basically gets the fabric to return to its natural state before the\ngarment is sewn with us you want maximum shrinkage of 5 percent while the cheaper\nbrands out there can shrink up to 10 that's basically a hole size we've\ninvested in top-of-the-line equipment that sets the industry benchmark for\nminimal shrinkage first we over stretch the fabric width wise to compensate for\nall the length tension it had in the previous processes next it goes through\nshrink drying chambers in which air blowers tumble the fabric and heat\ntriggers the cotton to revert to its natural state as it shrinks and dries\nthe fabric kind of like a super fancy industrial version of your dryer at home\nthese shrink dryers are a million dollars so it's no wonder mini\nmanufactures skip this step or do their own subpar version of it next the fabric\ngoes through compactor which compresses the length of the fabric using steam\nmaking it physically shorter since the length is where most of the shrinkage\ntends to occur this ensures that when a tee comes to you the fabric has been\nshrunk both lengthwise and widthwise we guarantee a shrinkage rate of five by\nfive meaning the absolute most it will shrink is five percent in both the\nlength and the wet it's always good to leave a little room for shrinkage so you\ndon't have the opposite problem which would be the tee stretching out have you\never had a side seam tee where after a wash that side seam isn't quite on the\nside anymore this happens but non croissant fabric returns to its original\nstate pulling the seam along with it through a\nshrink drying process by stretching and shrinking the fabric\nprior to sewing we eliminate any torque or twisting of the fabric after it's\nbeen washed at home I'm sure if you have a belly canvas tee at home\nyou notice how little it shrinks compared to other brands in your drawer\nthat's because we are the only manufacturer that is invested in\ntop-of-the-line preshrunk dryers like we've just shown you with us we want\nwhat you see to be what you get with no surprises when you take our teas home a\ntea like ours that looks just as awesome after multiple washes as it does right\nout of the box it's just one of the things that separates us from them next\nweek is our last episode of this series and we're talking about the\nenvironmental impact of a t-shirt so don't forget to subscribe Be

because the rest of the apartment right now is a mess so that is what you're getting right now a wall enjoy congratulations i am in the market for a white t-shirt i want a crew neck t-shirt i feel like they're a little bit more i don't know put together looking uh and i have a very strange way about like myself i am very research oriented and analytical and i always need to look at all the options before choosing what works for me so uh when i realized i need a white t-shirt i was like well i gotta try them all on first like all the white t-shirts out there it's honestly quite annoying and exhausting sometimes to be like that but well that is me so what am i gonna do i obviously cannot try all the t-shirts on all the t-shirts in the world i can't that said i did order quite a bit and uh i'm gonna take you guys with me on this wonderful wonderful journey of figuring figuring out which white t-shirt is the best white t-shirt of them all asos h m everlane and cotton these are our t-shirts for today i think asus has several brands in it so we'll open them up we'll feel them we'll try them on and we'll decide what do we think about it let's go also can we all appreciate the fact that i did my eyes today for this video i was very nervous because i pretty much have not used makeup this year because you don't need it in quarantine but this was quite an endeavor see i think it turned out pretty cute making some effort over here all right okay so first a sauce let's see what we have i ordered it quite a while ago so i honestly don't remember very well what is it that's in every bag okay let's unbox this oh look at that so this is a stradivarius strategy values t-shirt it's a two pack it's actually a white and a black t-shirt so if it works it will be double bingo because who doesn't need a black t-shirt you know um so that looks cute [Music] then we have topshop this looks cute as well damn topshop boxy t-shirt in white i see you okay and then we go with mango mango actually doesn't feel that nicely done but we'll have to try it on h m let's see h and then a good old friend i first went shopping at h m when i lived in sweden on a study abroad it was a very swedish experience i was like what is this store uh and you know little did we know that they would conquer the world uh and i have an h m tish t-shirt divide from the divided line okay i have a t h m t-shirt from the basics line and i have more like a cream cream t-shirt also from the divided line everlane i've been obsessed with everlane their quality is so amazing they are transparent they are not very expensive so honestly like i could order so much from everlane i already have so much from everlane so let's see how their t-shirts do [Music] i ordered quite a bit of everlane t-shirts honestly quite a bit i'm just gonna try them on all already because like there's like five t-shirts here oh my god this is gonna be a long video [Music] did i order different sizes that's what happens when you order and then you forget um okay i think i'm gonna have analysis paralysis here but that's for small something i ordered something black what's black jesus okay everlane we'll get to you last but not least a brand called cotton k-o-t-n i learned about it from uh the instagram account of a fashion blogger her name is abby the instagram account is clothes and pizza and she is wonderful and she pays attention to sustainable fashion and i learned about this company from her comes in this you know brown baggie it comes wrapped nicely that's clearly when you know that you order from a good company they pay attention to details like that because they actually have you know they're not that focused on producing a massive amounts in the shortest time for the cheapest price so that's what they are cotton c cotton cotton uh and i have a white and a black t-shirt from them there first contender is from everlane this is a classic t-shirt a pretty good fit a little tiny bit of snug but i'm sure it will stretch uh it has a little bit of a more of a crew neck stitching here the classic one i like it it's a little more see-through than i would want it to be but um i mean it's also a white cotton t-shirt like what do you expect and generally i really like the feel of it i like that it's slightly elongated so that i can do the tuck you know the french tuck or whatever talk you want to do on it hello tan friends yeah this is like the classic t-shirt feels really good again organic cotton 100 and i like this kind of like accentuated crew stitching here through neck next is this i have so many plastic bags on the floor right now uh it's another everlane t-shirt it's the pocket t-shirt because it has a pocket um it's pretty good it's more of a boxy cut than the previous one so a little more on trend a little more relaxed uh i kind of like it more compared to the previous one because it's not as snug and again it's this very nice cotton which feels really nice and soft uh i like it another evalene t-shirt it's called the raglan tea it has this a-line cut to it here is the stitching over here it kind of needs a bit of a steam but you can get the feel out of it it has this nice a-line silhouette to it which i think really elongates your arms and the neck and makes you look very you know sophisticated uh i love it actually this is not something that i was looking for i was looking more for a regular t-shirt but this is just very nice [Music] it's kind of a regular white t-shirt but a little bit more elevated this is a t-shirt from the brand called cotton k-o-t-n uh and it's also a classic crew neck t-shirt uh the cut is a little bit wider than the previous evelyn classic crew night t-shirt um but it's really cute too the material is very similar to what everlane does maybe it's a little bit more see-through but honestly hard to tell and look at this nice touch and and their packaging there is a there's a photo of people who make this i don't know if these lovely ladies are making this particular t-shirt but they work at the company and cotton actually has a pretty elaborate website that shows their factories and how they work very nice option it's more expensive than ever lane and maybe i like the cut at everlane of the neck line cut better at everything this is tough this is a very obviously oversized t-shirt it's from h m um it's i'm in love with every white t-shirt apparently so that's gonna be that it has a bit of a drop sleeve here so i think that's what makes it look so nice uh and again the the nice crew neck uh like folding and stick i don't know how to explain but when they make this neckline so kind of like chunky chunky-ish but i love it um that's if i want to have a bit of a oversized boxy a t-shirt which maybe i do now i don't even know uh but this looks nice and obviously all asian them t-shirts uh much cheaper than everland or cotton uh i don't think it's like a crisp white it has a tiny bit of a nude in it a tiny bit of like a cream to it but uh and maybe i want a crisp white t-shirt i think i do um but it's nice too i kind of have the same t-shirt uh more like a new t-shirt that i borrow from mike all the time so i might not need this one by the way yes oversized t-shirts first go through your husband's boyfriend's partner's wife's closet might find some very nice items there another white t-shirt from h m this is from the basics line uh this t-shirt is actually much different from all the other ones because this cotton is much happier much silkier and much less see-through if at all from compared to all the other t-shirts that i've been trying on it also has this crew neck um it's boxy but not too much i can still tuck it in tuck it in uh or not i kind of love it because it has this heavy expensive feel to it like this could be like um like a nicer t-shirt that you can like go out in for the evening or something like it just has this very expensive feel to it because it's a heavier material we like it a lot the last h m t-shirt that we're going to look at today it's from their divided collection and it has a lighter feel to it the material is lighter compared to the previous t-shirt and obviously it also has this cap sleeve which some people like some people don't it gives you more of a like you know a bit of like a muscular buff feel of this that's how i feel in it uh it's a little more fitted but other than that it's a great t-shirt uh maybe not for me not so much since i already looked at so many that i i can tell that maybe this is not exactly what i want and what i feel like today but other than that it's a great trick check it out i am moving on to my order from asos and this is a t-shirt from topshop uh this is kind of uh reminds me of this raglan tea from everlane because of this a-line silhouette but this is actually not as a line now that i look at it it's more just like a boxy silhouette and the material is nice and heavy which i love uh it's similar in what the h m t-shirt was like in the way it feels like nice and heavy and expensive uh yeah i mean this is pretty cool this is small all the t-shirts i was wearing they are the size small so you can get an idea of what works for you and what doesn't i'm usually small but sometimes that could be medium depending on the fit and what not uh but yeah this is very nice again this is a crew neck with a nice neckline um and i love this one obviously needs a bit of a steam again but other than that like i feel so comfortable in it this is interesting this t-shirt is from stradivarius as you can see it's a crop t-shirt again size small and it comes as a two pack a white t-shirt and a black t-shirt and to make sure that it stays as a two pack they decided to tie it together uh so that's the black t-shirt and i just don't want to cut the tags just yet but you can see that they're tied together so that's how i'm gonna model it for you now tied together um i might actually get i don't know we'll see about that uh it's kind of inconvenient that i can't just try it on by itself uh but it's a pretty nice crop look it's a boxy fit it is a size small uh so true to size and um it's a nice material it's not uh too light or too heavy i don't know but uh it's nice it's a it's a cute t-shirt if you want a cropped t-shirt for your high-waisted jeans and obviously if you want a black t-shirt to go with it it's also there i actually do need a black t-shirt like that so they actually last t-shirt i just couldn't find it and then i thought i was done i'm like oh my god this is like an unopened bag still here this is a t-shirt from mango again it's within my asos order and i don't think it's gonna be a contender to be honest after looking at all these t-shirts i don't think so uh i feel like this neckline will stretch sooner than later i feel like i don't want my t-shirt to stretch right away and something about this t-shirt tells me that i will pretty soon so thank you for bearing with me and looking at all these t-shirts with me uh i think i will have to pick two because honestly there's so many great options and i feel like a white t-shirt is something that i will wear the hell out of so i might as well have slightly couple slightly different ones and wear them to different occasions or just around the house and so on and so on so i think i will certainly go with this t-shirt from everlane it's a classic crew neck and i think because it gives me some sort of like james dean vibes i don't know or like marilyn brando you know the photo where he's like and james dean also they do that they like stand by the wall and like they're hot and they wear a white t-shirt i don't know something about this crew neck here like it's a little rougher looking crew neckline here so something about that gives me those feels i don't know why but i will go with this t-shirt it's also slightly more fitted so i could like throw a blazer on top it could be a more elegant outfit uh because it's just a classic and the second t-shirt will be hold on don't go anywhere i'm gonna change and the second t-shirt is from h and them it's the one with the heavier material it's slightly more boxy and oversized looking so that's why i'm gonna keep it uh and i like it i like my little t-shirts combo what do you guys think um and then this one just makes me feel so comfortable thank you so much for watching my crazy t-shirt chaos here i hope it helped you understand more like what's out on the market right now there is a lot of great options it's just

[Music] [Music] welcome to the unpaved meant I'm Jeremy McGee and I'm on a mission to document trails for adaptive riders recording on my brand-new GoPro max I'm filming right now in Hero Mode let me switch to 360 so you can see the difference all right here's 360 mode now watch what you can do with this let's see here I'll just like cruise across the room and I can follow me the cameras not moving oh pretty cool so I'm curious to see what looks better this way or this way this is back to hero mode they both export to 1080 also I'm not using a microphone as you can tell I usually have a lapel mic because I'm in my garage and it's noisy in here the hero max has a shotgun mic alright let's get to this video let's watch some mountain biking my really good buddy Marc Herman who lives in basalt Colorado came down to join us and we also met up with Daniel's friend Pete [Music] what's going on really cool we're just doing a little trail work right here's a little narrow semi off camber it's not too bad but it can use a little build up and so Pete's just organizing rocks all right we're testing Pete's masterpiece right now let's see here we go [Music] yeah dude really stout this is beautiful yeah buddy he's gonna just gonna manhandle him he's gonna Dan handle him ha ha ha yeah buddy yeah hahahaha put your arm around my neck yeah that's fun I like that look like a perfect block look at that oh yeah look at that that's awesome everything here I'm gonna say is a MTB one even though Daniel had a little flip over it totally could have been avoided he just made a mistake we really didn't run to any obstacles the views are amazing there's some trails that are a little narrow with cactus along the side so be careful with that but otherwise go get it this day was a double session two rides in the afternoon after taking a little break we headed out to fruta 218 Road we're gonna do the Kessel run how many parsecs will it take you've never heard of the millennium fault should I have it's a ship that made the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs after you [ __ ] [Music] [Music] that is surrounded like a rollercoaster [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that was fun dude because Daniel needed a spot in a few sections we're gonna rate this trail a MTB too but it is close to being a MTB one our second run we climbed up yeah what's the name of the trail [ __ ] I forgot prime cut since it's single track there was a lot of steering with one hand cranking with the other oh yeah there you go nice [Music] Creole is also close to being a MTB one I needed a spot in one section and there was also a like a steep ledge II rock I could get it with practice but some adaptive riders might need a little push up that so we're gonna rate this trail a MTB - because of that but again it's really close to being a MTB 1 then we down hilde PBR which is which was so fun it's really similar to Kessel run where it's flowy and bur me but there's a little more technicality to it thanks for watching this episode if you like this video definitely let me know with a thumbs up it really helps me to keep going next video I head to st.

that one so that's why I'm doing this video today if you want to learn more about my group please check us out on Facebook it's called Brown girls crash with cricket and on that group and in that

use a scissor sizer glitter this HDTV vinyl I'm going to use some black 100% cotton t-shirt I'm going to be using the image that I bought from Coco twins are you gonna do the heat press put your paper transfer tape I think that's it alright let's get started I'll go ahead and go to design that's Cricut I'll try to get some to look at while I talk that's quick website to show you two new little mini aren't they have which i think is gonna waste some money well it might be good for um hats I think that'd be a good but I'm sure T real quick what I'm talking about it but it's $69 I have the smart I have all three of the presses I mean I have all three of the easy presses and it's the mini one and $69 and it's good for hats and um probably bowtie I mean Bosley beekeeper bows but I don't think I'm getting that let me know about low if you have it I rating what you think about it and then um comment below okay let me go ahead and push these I new project okay all right be not my project I'm already have the item that I want to I already have the image that I want to use let me go back to my projects click on that and I already got it I didn't do anything to it I just uploaded it some go here to push customize like I said own thing only step I'm missing is when you go to basically upload and you go into your files and define your own SVG or PNG whatever you want to use and I have another video on that also how to upload PNG is how to change your colors SVG's and videos are all that so I'm not gonna go below okay I have this beautiful woman right here I love her I love her and you reach my chose reason why I purchased this SVG is because of the colors except the mission it's all about the colors to me well it's also because sublimation when you really can't feel it and your shirt so I love that because if I know you can feel it but something mission you can't feel it so I really love some elimination because of two things you can't feeling on your shirt you don't feel like anything else and then plus the colors are so vibrant so when I seen this on Coco twin attack comics I have I gotta have her I gotta have her the colors are vibrant they're pretty this colorful and I've been doing lot of sublimation not my civilization being really like black and white and a few colors I want to show my colors out on my cell emission printer that's why I purchased I'm gonna put her on everything I'm gonna do this shirt today I'm gonna do another video of me putting her on a mug yeah she's gonna be on everything I'm thinking about putting her in the bag too she's beautiful I love the colors I need to find more color more images with colors like this they have a lot of cartoon colors a lot of cartoon characters with a lot of colors but I love to find my african-american women with different colors and I can change the colors on this SVG you could change colors like I said I have a video that shows you how to change the colors of SVG's so I'm not gonna do all that today I don't think I'm gonna do today is size this up and put on the show you got to put on the shirt okay first of all let's go ahead and do this the sighs wood creaking to cut and print which is caught we have to do a cut print for sublimation with Cricut so we have to go by the size and the size is just 0.75 by 9 okay I'm gonna do 6.75 go ahead and go across like this right here 6.75 go over okay that's the picture right there i know ii said i just don't like i hate that I have to cook with um that side I wish I could do a bigger footprint could but I'm still trying to figure out how to um I can do it you can't print bigger on um silhouette but I don't have a cutter to cut my glitter bigger you know I'm saying so I have to do this size because my glitter has to be good okay on my Cricut so yes that's it like you say you if you want that you can't print this bigger if you're just doing to the mission but since I'm using glitter I might just use that size right now until I figure it up to figure out the other ways of doing it then put the words I'm going to make it bigger I'm gonna make the words vital okay this is my shirt since my own pictures that I'm gonna make my words I'll stay in my picture so I can have some my picture so my shirt can be evened out let's see okay everything said now I have the UM the width six point seven to seven and then um the height is seven point seven three eight I like the way cuz if I go any I could go down to nine but it's gonna it's not gonna look right so I like the way it look like like that then I have her on the words this is gonna be my no on black and this is gonna be glitter one black okay so I need to do is go here so I got my size everything together I need to go ahead and duplicate her make sure you have everything situated before you duplicate it cuz you do not want to change you okay so now this is a cutting print files I got a highlighting right here it says cut and print okay and then this one also says cut and print but I do not want this to be a cut and print I want this to be a cuts okay just so right here it's flattening and you sit down here she's flattened and she's ready to get cut pretty cooked just right here now I'm siding her and I'm going to go ahead and go to see it's print right there I'm gonna no field I'm go ahead and wheeled her see how that was just the UM cooked so it's gonna cut around her butter arrange and sent to the front so you can see just what I'm gonna do when I know my shirt this is how it's gonna be okay cannot sub on 100% cotton or dark colors unless you put it on vinyl first on white glitter vinyl okay I tried to so I tried to do the super fine it was a little bit too dark so just keep it with the white vinyl the white glitter vinyl okay look at like I said before this is gonna be my white glitter I'm it's red but it's this color I wanted to do it you want me to put it white I can put it right someone be confusing imma go ahead and change the color up here to make it white okay okay but this doesn't matter because I'm whatever vinyl I put in my cutter that's what's gonna cut out okay for all you're a newbie still all the ones that you know just started couldn't using the cookie get kind of confusing so now that you see over here you have the cutting print for her and you have this is um welded and she's flattened you have to flatten it to cut and print or to something mate you hit the flattener okay so now I'm gonna work with this down here this is just a cut so you see this this um go here so make sure that this is ready it should be welded and it's just a it's a cut so let's go ahead and see um this is this was already image so it's not words that I made this was a SVG already so it's not really ready to cut okay let's go ahead him to make it as you see right here she's on a white sheet of paper because this is going to be sublimation printer I have two printers you can use both print you can use the same printer for each you gotta have one sublimation printer if he does information you have to have a regular printer if you do a regular cut and print okay we're just gonna be sent to my sublimation printer and then you see this mat this is gonna be cut on my silver glitter I think this is gonna be cut when you know what I changed this to white I'm gonna change this to white because I'm going to be using um black shirts when you go ahead and cancel that and go back and change this so even though I could have left it black cos might like I said doesn't matter but I won't let you so you won't be confused I'm gonna change this to white I'm thinking about putting your own white glitter also okay cuz I'm using a black shirt okay go back to this okay so everything set this is one to my printer this is going to not both of these are going to my cutter and they're sitting on the same mat so I'm gonna worry about having two different mats with these to make sure it even so I won't um it's good over since we want I can say be some vinyl cuz Rhino ain't cheap y'all I know is not cheap okay so you have to mirror because you're putting this on heat you have to mirror both of them so it's clear to mirrored this cuz you're something mating and this is on heat two side mirror that also okay all righty so let me go ahead and get my sublimation everything printed out and I'll be back okay I just want to show you something real quick I got my image RVD cut up I mean print it out from my printer from my own sublimation printer and then I'm gonna show you this when you put down the UM vinyl the glitter bottom make sure you put the shiny side down on the mat okay I'm gonna show you how to yard first so y'all know make sure you put it the shiny side down on the mat make sure it's straight make sure you have a nice sticky mat so will not be moving by from the printer I want to show you that real quick okay and then why this is cutting my to me just cutting their words and then the body parts of the mayor the bottom layer of her I'm gonna go ahead and cut her out besties I'm gonna take this to the printer also I had the printer cut this out also okay and these black registration marks is what keeps the UM Cricut let you know how to print it out so let me go ahead and show you this real quick I already sent it to the printer and I was talking to send it to the cutters it actually where you want to send it to and they already noticed it right here number one it says it's already been printed okay so now it's time to cut it and I'm going to go ahead and send it with paper instead of cardstock I'm gonna put use paper okay and there's a paper I just basically took mine went to my finger and I turned my knife to paper okay so now you know the sitting thinking that that I put loaded into the mat after I put the paper on the mat downloaded then it's gonna cut it out alrighty there she is I got her on a mat this mat ought to be that sticky cuz you know with the paper tears really stands we're gonna show you all the process so you can know how to do it I was gonna skip these process and just go straight through it but I'm gonna show it to you because I already have this process already done I'm one of my printing cut videos but I'm go ahead and go through it again okay I put it on this kind of say I put on paper settings the arrows going because they're telling me go ahead and push the arrow catch they don't push the button [Music] it's so busy you think I'm doing a pretty cook but I'm not well I am but I'm gonna be doing some of the mission also okay so are you thinking this is a prank oh okay now I get the image out of the UM cutter it's cut and it's the same way deal stickers and everything else to cut and print okay that's it out now I'm going to discov I know it's the second step you have to do okay so I make sure this is on a mat upside down like I said it's shiny side down I'm good to my computer okay so now that we've done this already which is it's done today check your stance it's completed it's print and cut so now we got to go down to here to the cut and I gotta change my settings back over to vinyl you know what this is winter vinyl so make sure you change it to glitter vinyl so that's custom because it is tougher you need to get a tougher cut with vinyl okay and I have my I have my binary little already favorite some way to push glitter okay then I'm gonna go ahead and push the button and it's ready to cook and I was always home I met it to give it a little tug so after that now I gotta push the see here like to see my computer southern is dead is cutting and I back at this when this pretty everything cook I just have to read everything I'll show you that real quick to already have a video on how the weed I'm go ahead and show you again so you can all see you just be one quick process for you I'm gonna take my little scraper thing and just trying to pull on the paper pull it up okay now you just go ahead and poke around a picture how about I do it this way better huh hold it down with the best way you can I really want to test the ink on the other side and they put it would be much more vibrant when we um to be sublimated okay a little earring out of here so now I'm just gonna cut around the image stuff to stay with with my nose I can okay and I'm also gonna separate the image from the words okay okay so let's go ahead and read out this glitter Whedon glitter is not too hard so let me go ahead and do this with y'all to see me do it you can't see the camera because it's white for the best way to read glitter it's a good go from the back of course just pour a little part closer to the ears and just pour it all around it you can certainly be tough with glitter cuz it's so deep you keep on pulling that pieces of it all I like it I like this image because it's not too many cuts in it it's just not a round surface but it's not too many you know cut better to do this when you trying to even it up on the arm Matt it's gonna be better to do it this way let me go here to lead out my words my phrase around it just start from the corner get your little piece wrap it and put yankees you can be able just tear it off okay you said your perfect setup is he ever seen the camera with a pen john wetton is by now but I'll try to make sure I see the full effect in the camera so sorry about that okay and I go down and I'm gonna go ahead and see some spots again take over here the little letters and Gert y'all I was right on the money I almost thought I had to cut these this bird over again but I didn't make sure you have enough I know very sticky in here don't thing I don't like about I'm simply made known by no because you can feel it you can feel the vinyl on the bottom on the back of the arm sublimation it's like a patch patchy feeling like a vinyl of course regular glitter vinyl and some permission is just so much is so soft and you'll have to worry about me feeling anything but guess what you got a do if you want to do it on dark colors and tighten tighter percent cotton shirts you have to do it like this you gotta get that patchy feeling on the back of it okay back Lord and still worthy I'm gonna get my he pressed together situated I did this shirt for my son and I use my mini press on that my Cricut easy press on this so I let me go ahead and just try to do this new one then just this project on my impress this is my first time using my heat press before so the mission on black uncle later okay I made this with my son and I like it I just my first one time doing it it's been a while and I see what you can tell when you um don't have the eye and a half together right here under the shirt so it kind of faded a little bit which is fine steel you see how down on glitter yeah outlined in that it's his shirt and this vinyl that's just regular vinyl oh my shirt today I'm going to be using the UM glitter vinyl okay so let's want to show you how that and not it's prepped his shirt first thing we need to do is go ahead and press it no first thing we need to do is go ahead and get the lint roller you got a little flip it based you can see a lot on black okay we'll see all that and I ever see that out here I'm glad I did that um shake it and press it get all the heat and moisture out of it using a medium shirt and skilled skilled in 100% cotton go ahead and get more straps with about five seconds sorry I got the window open like I said I had to let the fume dust in his heat press and it's kind of loud outside from the highways right there okay when you just have the mission you supposed to put butcher paper in between a shirt but I'm not gonna do that because we're stepping on top of glitter so it would not bleed through the glitter I'm not gonna put any butcher paper between the shirt okay well but I will put the foot put your paper on top of the shirt okay the first thing we gotta do is go ahead and set up our glitter always do three inches below for them a little ruler right there a bit more now you see how the glitter paper if you're your first time using literacy how it's already have this contact paper just ink paper on there and you don't have to even use whichever when you good or you can just use that but I'm gonna use anybody's to protect my heat press that's perfect I feel good now put the words down right here and make sure when you put the word down do not let the plastic touch each other so I want to give you kind of close to the body so I'm gonna cut around here so you can get a little close to it on the right when it works too far from the image okay now I have it on the heat press I'm go ahead and put my put your tip on top of it I'm gonna go ahead put my boot up camp on top of it and go ahead and press it for like ten seconds four hundred to ten seconds if you can um just to get that glitter to stay stick one for little eyes oh I don't do I just do ten seconds just get that glitter down 400 for ten seconds I'll do 15 400 for 15 seconds now let it cool for a little bit I'm gonna bring it over here on table because I want the cool before I put the picture on there because I don't want the picture to fade off one the ink on the glitter before I put it on the heat press okay bring it over here let it cool off a little bit see I just pull it off there's the glitter I'm gonna lift that one the word but if so won't do to gonna put that back on the top of the word when I put the ink on here okay so it's cooled off a little bit I think it's good yes be cooled off real quick and I'm going to put it on sublimation on top yeah he's gonna do the same thing my son shirt did it on paper is going on top but the shirt which is going to show so next time it's got to cut the glitter a little bit bigger cuz it does shrink and I heard getting a few videos to that it does shrink but oh well there's a tape of beer so I won't move I'm gonna cover this back up on the heat yeah it's gonna all righty let's see really do y'all I know that the goof up when I'm on YouTube I'm now on YouTube it's all good so hopefully just come turns out decent for this tutorial and I'm go ahead and press it

on the hunt for the perfect white t-shirt and it's so long and if that's you too probably why you clicked on this video i'm going to be investigating eight different t-shirts and we're going to be putting them to the test for a few different things fit price feel sustainability so let's get to it my name is amanda weldon be sure to subscribe would love to have you part of the fam but let's get to this video the first one that we are going to investigate is a canadian brand if you've heard of a lego shop before you probably have your frequenting style youtube here she is the founder of uncle studios and this was my first impression of the t-shirt okay so these are my initial reactions nice and thin not see-through i am wearing a beige bra though so i will do test later honestly the length is really nice it's not too long but it's long enough that you can tuck it in and it will stay tucked in that's always so annoying when you have a t-shirt you want to tuck in and then you move and it just kind of comes untucked i think as well it honestly has this really nice kind of a bit more cap sleeved but not too cap sleeved but not like down your arm i know there's different styles that people like but uh the threading very minimal and it's super soft nothing about this t-shirt is itchy so that is my first impression i like this one the soft feel of this t-shirt comes from the components that make it micro model and super cotton i hope i'm pronouncing that right a 50 50 blend and as well this t-shirt is made in canada something that i was definitely impressed with on their website was reading more about their eco-conscious materials and their ethical labor you can definitely see more about their sustainability practices there if you go into their education sector which i have linked down below you can read a little bit more especially about the specifics of those two fabrics so moving forward this is a lightweight t-shirt so my worry was it was going to be a little bit see-through and it proved to pass the test the thing i loved about it so much was the feel and as well where it hit me on my body and it being lightweight is nice it won't pill it won't lose its shape and as well this will be so perfect during the warmer months it hit the bank account though 48 u.s they also talk about why it is that way on the website and i ended up ranking this one one of the highest at 23 out of 25. next up we have madewell so this madewell t-shirt when i tried this one after the uncle studios one i thought hey it's actually pretty similar but here is how it is different okay so first impressions of this t-shirt again very light doesn't feel thick at all easy to move it's a little bit off-white it's not that perfect perfect white so i like the way with the color is a little bit thicker and yeah this one's pretty pretty simple this t-shirt is 100 cotton made in guatemala and i found it different from the uncle studios one because i didn't find it as soft and when i started doing a little bit more investigation on a website called good on you which i definitely recommend you guys check out i'll link that down below as well i looked up every single company we're going to investigate but some weren't found on it however for madewell unfortunately their ranking was not so good they scored 11 to 20 percent on the fashion transparency index and that's when they look into information like the source of their materials where they're made the people the planet the animals all things that are incorporated in that but though that they ranked pretty low on that one they actually do have a ton of sustainability practices when it comes to their denim so maybe you've heard of madewell because of their denim now madewell is a branch of j crew and to be honest this t-shirt was pretty basic if you were just looking for a standard white t-shirt it was pretty good the size range as well was pretty inclusive and that was ranging from a double extra small to a double extra large and their pricing was pretty inclusive as well around 21 canadian sadly the shipping was half the cost of the t-shirt as well so it actually ended up coming to 31 overall i don't know why i just wasn't as impressed with this one and i took off some points just because i wasn't sure how sustainable this branch of the company was just because of that transparency index and then as well the durability next up this is this is one i'm so excited to tell you about and this is one a lot of you voted on instagram for me to check out oh this is such a nice t-shirt damn okay first impressions of this one oh my god this is a thick t-shirt but it is beautiful this is the kind of t-shirt that i picture like with dress pants and a really nice layered jewelry moment it is so nice i actually love where this sleeve hits my arm and the thick layer as well it's kind of got that like thick stitch i feel like you could do if you're someone who likes to spice it up a little bit you could do the one two roll so you hide that seam oh i love this one i could see myself getting this in another color i think that's how you know you want to get multiples 100 cotton and made in vietnam this t-shirt when i put it on i just kind of knew you know that feeling i'm actually wearing it right now because i was so impressed and it was definitely one of my favorites the way that it hits me on my body as well as the length of the sleeves i definitely definitely liked and just the thickness it made it feel a little bit more upscale like i could match this with a really nice pair of trousers and then stack some jewelry and i would be all set to go and feeling really chic when it comes to sustainability on good on you they still ranked it's a start so that's still kind of mid-range when you go to their website though they do have so much more information about their sustainability practices and it really seems like they are trying to continue to push this forward it was designed in paris and basically called the ultimate basic t-shirt and i could totally get behind that whether it comes to the design or kind of the thickness and durability and versatility of this t-shirt i'm all for it double x or small to double extra large as their size range and this one will come in costing you around 30 plus tax it got to my door pretty quickly and i was impressed with everything about it i ended up ranking this one 24 out of 25 4 out of 5 for sustainability because there's still some work to be done province of canada made in canada canadian canadian-born but clearly this isn't the one guys this is a beautiful t-shirt it's super well made it's made in canada it's 100 cotton it's really nice and i think the reason why i ordered all these t-shirts in small and this is a unisex t-shirt so it's uh just on the larger side and these sleeves come down so much lower i think that this one's going to scotty but if you guys like the um the longer sleeves this might be the one for you okay so this is such a tough one made in canada 100 cotton this was honestly a beautiful t-shirt but because it was unisex they were saying on the website if you are a woman you probably want a size down i ordered all of these t-shirts all eight in a small so that you could see the range of them there's definitely some work to be done when it comes to their transparency about sustainability specifically but on their website they do say there's a reason you feel reassured when you find a t-shirt that reads made in canada on the label too many local manufacturing is synonymous with quality and equality which is why made in canada is the main pillar of our company now because the size wasn't for me i had to bring in scotty we are pretty similar in size and i thought that this would be way better suited for him and this is what he had to say yeah it fits you really well it's the providence of canada tea the province of ontario province of canada yeah it's nice it fits well i think um all in all because this is a unisex t-shirt i honestly think it fits you better than if it's me yeah yeah did they have an extra smell i think so yeah it's a really nice t-shirt though yeah the material is amazing it feels really really soft when he asked me if there was an extra small i wasn't 100 sure so looking into the size range there's actually extra extra small to extra extra large which means a very inclusive size range and then when it comes to their pricing as well this was a little bit pricier of a t-shirt 38 dollars but i did end up getting 10 off because of a welcome deal overall i rank this one 19 out of 25 but i think if i had gotten the right size it would have been up a little bit higher so this is the only one that i say take it with a grain salt have you ever heard of the brand cotton this is a really cool brand guys and i'm excited to tell you about it this was their packaging and then they as well sent along this little tote it was the only company to do this in the full gamut of things this one's really thick you can tell it's really well made the stitching is beautiful but it's a bit off-white so if you're looking for like a crisp crisp white this one is a little bit off-weight and it has a very different color than the other ones it kind of has like a ribbed collar but it's nice and thick and i think the shoulders might be just too wide for me but this is a really beautiful one and the sleeves come down a little bit longer no cap sleeve here so after my first impressions this had a different kind of stiffness to it 100 cotton egyptian cotton and made in egypt and this t-shirt i thought was really cool it's really hard to tell on camera but it is a bit of an off-white and the sustainability practices of this company are very impressive and they also have a lot on their website when it comes to education about their farms and sourcing of their products so definitely check that out for their t-shirt though the fit is actually a little bit boxier it's a vintage inspired t-shirt and it's a band tee and around the neck it had a really cool ribbing detail that was so different than any of the other t-shirts it's going to run you around 38 and the size range as well was inclusive with that double extra small to double extra large this one actually ranked quite high 22 out of 25. it just wasn't the fit that i specifically was looking for okay so let's do erisia as a whole because there's three t-shirts that i sourced from maurizia their sustainability practices still have work to be done on good on you they definitely talk about that and on their website i actually never knew this i've been on the uricio website so many times but i've never reached out to their sustainability side of things and it was really cool learning more so i put that link down below so you can check it out too the first brand we're going to look into is daviton so this is the only one of the white t-shirts that i've actually had for a while and it's the babiton everyday shirt you can tell it's a lot shorter than the other ones and it's a bit like slinkier in feel versus that stiff 100 cotton i really enjoyed having it i lay it flat to dry and it's kind of that perfect layering underneath a sweater or something like that but if you are someone who likes a longer t-shirt because you want to tuck it in and when you raise your hands you don't want it to come up this might not be the one for you but all in all it's super soft and it's a pretty basic go-to teeth this t-shirt is 94 round and 6 elastane and made in china funny enough about this t-shirt specifically this is the only one that i actually already owned before this video and this ended up being one of my least favorite t-shirts i don't know why i think i'm just when it comes to a white t-shirt i really want that structure because i think that a white t-shirt when it's crisp and a little bit more structured it can look so sleek however because of this more like elastaney feel there was a bit more of a see-through quality to it the one thing i did love that i could use this as is a workout t-shirt because it is nice and stretchy or for hiking i think it would be great it'll run you thirty dollars not too bad middle of the road and the size range is from double extra small to extra large i ended up ranking this one 17 out of 25 taking points off for some sustainability fabric opacity and fit as a whole for me personally next up is wilfred and these were my first impressions this is the only fully ripped t-shirt and you can tell it's a lot tighter than the other ones a totally different style has more of a cap sleeve and finishes right at the top of a high-waisted jean this is definitely just like for a totally different situation and i would consider this more a casual white t-shirt versus some of the other maybe even more oversized ones that you could dress up with some jewelry so i like this one but it really all depends on what you're looking for 91 model and 9 elastane i think my first impressions were pretty we're pretty accurate with this one this t-shirt just looks so casual and it is much tighter again i think i would consider this one more as a workout t-shirt it has a shrunken fit a crew neck it's ribbed it reminds me of a high school girls t-shirt it just kind of i don't know what it is about it it just comes off a lot more casual than the other ones did and a little bit more young looking but that totally makes sense for eritsia and the range of people that shop there i still really loved this t-shirt i think there's just a time and a place for it and what i was looking for was my everyday t-shirt that i would pick out for zoom calls and just running around whereas this one wouldn't be the one that i would grab for it was honestly so soft though and i would definitely take this one on a vacation double extra small to double xl was the range and surprisingly this seemed like the tiniest t-shirt but it ended up being the most expensive one from auritzia it came in at 40. total was 45 20 canadian taking some points off for fabric opacity as well as the fit and maybe a bit of sustainability i ranked this one 16 out of 25. last but not least we have sunday best again from auritzia as for the sunday best t-shirt this is a lot thicker than the other two from auritzia i would say this kind of also rivals the earlier t-shirts that were just that thick opaque you're not going to see your bra through it at all i think that if you're wearing a white bra as well you won't see it and it's obviously as well a lot tighter and finishes at the top of your high-waisted jeans i think that's more of the style of orizia kind of the clientele that they're looking for as well and this is a beautiful t-shirt it's very soft it feels just like good it just feels like i don't know it would be a really nice go-to and it also all depends on whether you want that tighter feel so i do really really like this one the only thing that i wish that i could do is i wish it was a little bit longer so that i could get that tucked in effect but other than that just i can see this is a really great like travel tee the total makeup of this one 57 cotton 38 polyester 5 elastane and made in china if we're talking about t-shirts that surprised me the most out of this whole test it was this one i actually love this t-shirt the only thing that makes it different from the uniqlo one because it definitely was thicker was it was much more slim fit and it also hit me much higher on my hip so it matched the top of my jeans kind of like i said earlier it definitely passed the opacity test and the size range was double extra small to xl i would recommend this t-shirt to you if you are going to find one in auritia i think that this one might be the one and surprisingly as well it was the cheapest one out of the three 25 dollars and the total price was 28.25 for the total score i ended up giving it 5 out of 5 for fit i really liked it 22 out of 25 total and i think that it really all depends on what you're looking for but personally for my style and what i'm looking for my top picks were uniqlo uncle studios cotton and sunday best tied for third specifically what kind of stood out to me about the uniqlo one and the uncle studios one that kind of ranks them equal in a way but i put the uniqlo one a little bit higher because of the thickness and i just love the way that it looks i think that pairing that with a nice pair of trousers and as well some stacked necklaces like i said earlier in the video would come off so beautifully and i definitely want to invest in the black t-shirt from them as well the uncle studios one i loved so much too and it was really hard to choose which one i would put first the only thing i found a little bit different about that t-shirt was that it definitely was thinner i think that if i was doing this investigation in the summer i would have maybe ranked that one first because of that thinner maybe more lightweight feel it would be a bit more comfortable in those hot months so all depending on where you live and where you plan on wearing your white t-shirts those are the two that i would highly recommend that you investigate further for yourself let me know in the comments below if you like this style of video it allowed me to flex my journalism muscle which was so fun also just kind of diving into the sustainability practices of all these t-shirts was so fun and i hope that you guys enjoyed that as well of course i'm not perfect i'm just going off of their websites as well as what i could find hopefully on good on you which is another thing i would suggest that you check out if you are looking into new brands subscribe become part of the fam thanks so much for watching and i hope you guys found your perfect white t-shirt i know i did bye [Music]", "uauA31ZEJ7k": "[Music] hello everyone welcome back to my channel in today's video I'm gonna talk about the perfect white tea so I asked you guys on Instagram if this is something that you want to see someone requested it and so many of you guys said yes so here I am I'm going to talk about the t-shirt I'm wearing as well as all of these ones on this rack right here I have about seven or so t-shirts I want to show you and talk about all different price ranges so hope you're excited about this super simple video so let's begin so some of the things that I look for in a really good perfect white t-shirt is number one structure if you've been following me you know I love that word structure but I like a good white t-shirt that sits on your body really nicely that's not gonna make you look too slouchy or too sluggish so this part right here is very important where it sits on your shoulder that's gonna make a t-shirt look like it fits you nicely or it's gonna look like it's too big another thing that I look for is sleeve length so I want something too long or too short but of course it depends on the look you're going for material is another very important thing so something that looks nice something that looks more on the expensive side but it doesn't have to be expensive neckline is one of the top most important things I typically go for a crewneck but any type of neckline you prefer that you think flatters your body goes well also for petite women Phoenix are also more elongated than crew necks I just particularly like crew necks because I do feel like they look more put together and a little more polished and I like a crewneck that sits pretty high up on the neck and that's pretty much the basics of what I look for in a good white tee I understand that so many people are looking for different things when it comes to the perfect white t-shirts so I've gathered like my top t-shirts from my closet that I love all with different characteristics and things like that so the first t-shirt I want to talk about is the one that I'm wearing right now I actually feel like I just wore this in a recent video but this is the one from eberlein so weird thing when I first got this t-shirt I didn't think too much of it just because it's just a white tee but the more than I wore it in my videos the more I loved it the more uses I found for it so this is something you can wear it dressed up dress down and the way that I really like wearing this t-shirt is under Blazers when you kind of want to go for that dressy yet carefree and casual look so it's not too form-fitting but it's also not too loose on your body I love the sleeves how it doesn't kind of like flare out but it just is a nice length not too long not too short I also like this part the neckline it's a crewneck but this part of the neckline is very thin and it's not super thick I feel like when you get a super thick neckline the more casual it looks and so this is why this t-shirts very practical and very versatile and the length is great as well as you can see I'm wearing it tucked in it hits you right about here so like I mentioned earlier this is one of my favorite ways to wear this t-shirt is under Blazers it is a very good layering type of tea so if that's what you're looking for then you need this t-shirt I am wearing an extra small in this t-shirt and price point is very very reasonable I believe it's like $25 or under $25 so great find all around alright so for the second t-shirt is this one right here this is probably one of my favorite t-shirts that I own in my closet and it's from Zara so yes Zara is a very very good place to find really good white teeth believe it or not you just have to take care of them so they last you a long time or you just have to buy duplicates of it I did buy this shirt two of them so I have two of them in my closet because it's kind of just like when you find such a good item at a low cost you do run the risk of it kind of falling apart faster if you don't take care of it as well so it's kind of smart to buy doubles of it so this one is a more form-fitting type of t-shirt I love it because it's ribbed I'm not sure if you can tell I also really really love the sleeves so it's a cap sleeve but it's also kind of like banded or at least it gives a banded look just the same as the neckline right here and then the rest of the shirt is semi semi semi sheer so it's not going to be a full opaque type of white tee but I love it to just use it by itself to pair with trousers and then there's add some jewelry the way that I'm wearing right now so if you like your white t-shirts to be more on the snug side more to form and fit your body then this is a really great tee so I got this tee awhile ago it's obviously not available anymore but I am going to link really really really good alternatives and then also it is a really good length so it is like au style right here you could tie it in a knot just like that you can tuck it and what-have-you this is just a really great type of t-shirt to have in your closet and again this is a t-shirt that you can pretty much wear with anything layering dressed up or this down it's when I also gotten a size extra small Azara alright so this next T is also from Zara so again like I mentioned I got doubles of this one just because it was very unique it's a very any t-shirt because it's more of an off-white color and I don't know if you can tell from the camera but it is also a very sheer type of t-shirt here is what it looks like up close so I like this t-shirt for pretty much this reasons that I loved the previous one that I just showed you but I really loved it because of the Sheerness you don't really come across too many sheer t-shirts like this I feel like it gives it a different look so in a way a little more dressy so if you were to use this t-shirt with mini skirts or mini skirts even leather pants and things like that and then just some jewelry um again I got this in an extra small and also because ara is a really good place to find white cheese I will link all the current ones for any ones that are in stock that I would buy myself in the description all right so this next white tea is by the brand shop redone in collaboration with Hanes and I've had this t-shirt for I don't know how many years now but like I said I take really good care of it which by the way I forgot to mention with the Zara ones because with Zara you might worry about it falling apart so it's really important to take care of your white t-shirts I don't bleach my white t-shirts or anything I do just wash them with only white items don't even wash them with light colors or anything I don't ever have an issue with like the armpits turning different colors or anything like that either but the dryer I feel like is the part that can do a lot of harm to our clothing items so you can always hang dry your t-shirts or flat dryer t-shirts instead of throwing them in the dryer and then also hand wash them in your washer instead of doing like a normal wash treat it like a delicate I know so that way you're able to preserve the life of them and have these in your closet for a longer amount of time and get more uses out of them so moving on this t-shirt like I said is from chakra done in collaboration with Hanes so if you're the kind of person that is looking for just your basic white tee no frills no bells and whistles just something casual then these are really good white t-shirts they're cotton they are box sees so they're not gonna be anything like I mentioned previously you can still wear them as layering the pieces you can still wear them under things like Blazers it's just not gonna have that more polished look and then again these ones are a little bit more on the shorter side so nothing too long which I think it's great you can still kind of tie them up and I'm not if you wanted to and it's also a lot easier to tuck in just because of the length these are a little more on the pricey side I would say around the $60 range so I have this one then I also have this one so this is also shop redone in collaboration with Hanes so as you can see this is a true white and then this is more of an off-white so if you've been watching me for a while you know different shades of white are very important to me I just feel like you need different shades to go with different things in different colors in your wardrobe so that's why I like having white and off-white because sometimes you need softer types of whites to blend with neutral colors and things like that I have a lot of neutrals in my closet you guys already know that so these ones I believe they always make and I wear an extra small all right so this next t-shirt right here is from ASOS so aces is another really good place that has inexpensive t-shirts and just good basics in general this one I love so much and I had to have in my closet just because it already has a roll sleeves so I love rolling my sleeves when it comes to wearing a white tee just because I feel like it gives a white t-shirt some character some life something just a little different than just being a basic plain old white tee I just like to dress it up a little bit more so the nice thing about this is that it's already sewn on there you know sometimes it can be so annoying to fold your seat just because they unfold on its own so yeah that's why I loved it and also it's just a really nice shape I really love how it looks from a side view right here it just looks like a really cool top so this is what it would look like tucked in which is how I would wear it and then another reason why I like this t-shirt is because it just you know looks like you put in a little bit more effort than just throwing on a white t-shirt and some pants because of the sleeves so I love this one so much this one I got in a size extra small alright next up I have this t-shirt from the Frankie shop this one has some shoulder pads on it this is one of my most coveted items in my closet right now and if you're on Instagram and you follow a lot of different bloggers and things like that you might have already noticed or have been seeing t-shirts like this around so this you can kind of dub as like a trendier piece all those shoulder pads have been around for centuries I feel like my grandma might have had a t-shirt like this but I love this t-shirt because it's kind of like the star so if you're looking for a white t-shirt to do all the tricks that has all the bells and whistles if you're looking for a white t-shirt that is a star that stands out that can be your work piece your nighttime going out piece your dinner piece things like that then this is a definite you should that you need in your closet it is more on the pricey side I want to say around $75 but I feel like it's worth it the material also feels really really nice the neckline band right here is also just so pristine and so nice this one I did get in an extra small so this is what this t-shirt looks like tucked in um so it's kind of like the one I just showed you from asos except with shoulder pads this is what the size of planks so it's a little bit of a drop leg drop arm or drop hole whatever you call it on the side so I just wear like a strapless new bra oh yeah I just would wear it just simple with jeans with some Knights trouser type of pants a miniskirt would look really nice leather pants would look really nice so if you don't want to spend $75 on this shirt I have a lot of different places where you can find more inexpensive t-shirts like this one again that I will link all right guys that's it for this video I hope you guys enjoyed it and found it useful don't forget to check out the description box because I will have a plethora of links for all the different white t-shirts that I love that I have found that are hopefully is still available I hope I will have a lot of different alternatives especially for the ones that are sold out by now again thank you so much for watching if you haven't subscribed to my channel yet I really appreciate it if you did so hope you guys are staying safe and healthy and I'll see you in my next video [Music]", "MZrv1rhd1eM": "Hey guys it's Megan with BELLA+CANVAS in\nthis video we're gonna cover everything you need to know about fabrics whether\nyou're brand new to the industry or if you're an industry vet I'm sure you've\nwondered what the difference is between Heather CVC and tri-blend or what the\nheck slub or poly viscose means today we're gonna break it all down for you let's start with the basics\nthe most common tea in the printable market is 100% cotton a lot of other\nbrands out there use carton open-ended cotton this is your cheaper or heavier\nscratchier or price point t-shirt at bella canvas we use only 100% cotton ring\nspun cotton what this means is we take the raw cotton and we comb out the\nimpurities and then it's ring spun to create a long strand of yarn so that\nwhen we knit our fabric its a tight weave and it's the best surface to print on\nthis is our style 3000 one the singles are like a thread count the higher the\nsingle the finer the fabric in the industry singles range for about 18 all\nthe way up to 40 your carded open-end cheaper tees are going to be in that 18\nto 20 single range our 100% combed and ring spun cotton is a 30 single and it's\na 4.2 ounce so 3001 is your go to basic hundred percent comb and ring spun tee\nit's great for discharge printing and direct garment printing we're going to\nget into all the details with printing tips for all the different types of\nfabrications down the line to keep your eyes open for that video to come another\nsuper popular fabrication is Heather CVC our Heather CvC is at 52% combed and\nring-spun cotton 48 percent polyester blend it's a 30 single at 4.2 oz\nHeather CVC basically means and it's a poly-cotton blend and CVC stands for\ncheif value cotton which is a fabric term to indicate that there's a slightly\nhigher cotton content than polyester the incredible market is trending towards\nHeather CVC because that polyester blend gives it that nice texture that nice\nsubtle dimension and the polyester blended with the cotton gives it a\nreally nice soft hand so you have other hundred percent cotton that's more of\nyour price point basic and then Heather CVC is a step up when it comes to\npricing now we're going to take a look at tri-blend tri blend is a unique blend of\ncotton polyester and rayon so you have the comfort of the cotton you have the\ndurability of the polyester and you have the drape from the rayon rayon was\noriginally developed as a substitute for silk that's what gives it it's super\nsoft hand with our tri-blend we have a 40 single and we're the only ones to do\na 40 single in the market I realize I'm bias that we have the best tri-blend in\nthe industry similar to Heather CVC tri ones also have that nice subtle texture\nand the reason for this is that the natural and the synthetic fiber\ntake the dye differently so that when it's knit you have that really nice heather\nlook one thing that's unique about bella canvas tri-blend is that we've also\nengineered our dyeing process so that the natural fibers and the synthetic\nfibers will take the color in a way that results in a solid tri-blend we're the\nonly ones in the industry to offer a solid tri-blend so you get that same\ngreat hand that silky drape but that solid color that sells so well in the\nindustry slub is more of a specialty fabrication\nthat you might not be as familiar with slub is basically the leftover fibers\nand it's a cotton poly rayon blend that's knit in a way that gives it this\nnice tonal texture so when you're screen-printing you get that dimension\nbut it's tonal so that it's approachable from a decoration standpoint people are\nreally into slub because it's something you see prevalent at retail right now\nand it's got that great vintage look to it if you're familiar with Bella\ncanvas you're probably familiar with flowy but you might not know what that\nnecessarily means the flowy collection is made of our poly viscose fabric it's\n65% polyester 35% viscose it's a 30 single and it's is 3.7 oz what's unique\nabout this it's got a really soft silky and it's an elevated fabrication that\nyou would find at retail for women's apparel\nit also drapes away from the body so it's slightly oversized so no matter\nwhat shape or size you are you're gonna find something in the flowy collection\nthat's right for you for the past seven years flowy has only been available to\nwomen but we recently added a poly viscose unisex tee to our fast fashion\ncollection and that's awesome for those sublimation printers out there because\nit's perfect for that type of printing last but not least we have our\nmarble fabrication marble is another one of our signature textures that gives you\nthat great dimension but it's awesome for graphic tees it's 91 percent\npolyester nine percent combed and ring spun cotton it's a 30 single and a 4\nounce so it's got a really nice soft tan to it and again that great texture a lot\nof other brands in the industry have Heather CVC and tri blend options for\nyou but no one else does dimension like this now you should all be fabric\nexperts but if you still have questions leave them for us in the comment section\nbelow it would have been too much to cover printing tips and the difference\nbetween all the fabrics so keep an eye out for our new video that will cover\nall of the different techniques for these fabrics right here Be Different", "8LV0Tic6Cuo": "hello guys and welcome back to my channel so the perfect basic t-shirt is something that can be quite hard to find and especially if the perfect basic white t-shirt there are so many different fits qualities and price levels in this area so I hope this video will help you in the search for the perfect basic t-shirt so in this video I am gonna show and compare no less than five different white t-shirts and what all of these t-shirts have in common is that they are all from brands if you guys have recommended to me also they are all either responsibly made so they maybe come from a responsible brand or they are made in organic cutting so this was one of the criterias for me to do this test going for a sustainable basic item is one of the easiest steps towards a more sustainable and intentional way of consuming fashion and I think it's something that everyone can do because the price difference between these t-shirts that I have found today and the ones that are conventionally made are not even that big the way that we consume fashion in general today is very selfish because the cost for you yourself is much more important than the cusp of our environment or the people in the production and that's where I think that the industry desperately needs a change so again going for the most responsible alternative on the market is a great way of starting this journey and to support initiatives like organic cotton or more transparent production and other things like that moving on so I've gathered five of the most important criteria in this area and let's just go through them I'm so sorry about my voice is still a bit scruffy after being ill last week it's just not going away so the first criteria for the perfect basic white t-shirt is that the quality or the break mustn't be too stiff but it mustn't be too slinky either so it kind of has to be in between those two so I can slip the flapper got the t-shirt I definitely prefer cutting above anything else so everything in be scopes or polyester which are both not very sustainable ways of making fabric for a t-shirt it's just a no-go for me I prefer something that is at least 95% cotton and preferably organic cotton so let's move on to the third criteria which is all about the fit personally I like to go for probably what you would call a boyfriend fit so it has to be slightly boxy slightly oversized and it has to have this crew neck like the one that I'm wearing today so no deep scoop Knicks or anything like that the crew neck is definitely the number one type of neck when it comes to basic t-shirts for me so the fourth criteria is that the basic t-shirt should wash well so the seams should stay at the sides at all times they shouldn't move to like the center of your belly after washing them one or two times if the seams tend to move when you wash your t-shirts lettuce happen a sign of poor quality and it's something that I myself have experienced when I buy t-shirts from very cheap high street brands finally one of the most important criterias and also one of the things that you guys are very frustrated about when it comes to especially white t-shirts is that it shouldn't be too see-through and that leads me to the nude bra because a nude bra is an absolute must-have in your underwear collection in general because it's just great to wear underneath like a very see-through button-down shirt but certainly also your white basic t-shirts it is almost impossible to find a basic teacher that's not just a tiny bit see-through and going for a nude bra it's just a great way of dealing with that if you're not into the hole peeking through underwear situation so I actually tried one out from a brat called organic basics which is also one of the brands that I ordered one of the t-shirts from it's a basic triangle problem no wires or anything like that and it's just super comfortable and I'm loving it already also the cutting quality from organic basics are often made in what you would call long fiber cotton which means that this fabric is just a lot more durable than conventional cotton and it will also look like new for a lot longer time okay so with all that in mind let's have a look at the five t-shirts that I'm going to show you and compare to each other today now as always everything that I show you in this video is going to be linked down below for you guys also I haven't tried any other t-shirts on yet because I kind of wanted to give you my full first impressions besides the teacher that I'm wearing today which is about six months old now and I'm going to compare this to the four others as well but that's just because this one comes from a responsible brand so I thought I just wanted to put that in together with the others I am gonna watch that just to see how well they wash and then I'm gonna give you my final verdict and then hopefully be able to pick out a favorites so that you guys can also pick out here on a favorite so yeah let's go so this t-shirt is called the cutting crew and it is from ever Lane so when it comes to the fit of this t-shirt it is just right up my street it has kind of a straight slightly oversized v and it has this crew neck as well when it comes to the quality it is quite thin also I can't seem to find any information on this t-shirt whether it organic cotton or not so I'm guessing it is just in conventional cotton but it is made in supima cotton which is kind of a quality March for Eveline so it is definitely better than the conventional alternatives out there when it comes to good quality but I would have liked it to be an organic cotton as well so that it was being made with fewer chemicals in the production as well also the fabric of this t-shirt is very thin I don't know if you're able to see it here but you can kind of see my jeans through the t-shirt and yeah it's just a bit too thin for my liking other than that the fit and the hand feel it's very soft and it feels great on skin and like I said it washes really well as well and also it comes from a responsible brand where transparency and good conditions in the production is something that's very important so so let's have a look at this one from organic basics this is the same brand as the nude bra that I spoke about earlier in this video there's just so much plastic waste in the fashion industry so it's great to see someone taking a bit more responsibility in that area all the teachers that I'm showing you today is in a size medium just to get that out there I'm also going to put that information down below but just in case I forget to say these are all in a size I mean you and I deliberately always choose a size medium just because I really like that slightly oversized fit so here is the one from organic basics I am not really fond of the finishing here at the neck it kind of looks like the fabric has been stretched a bit too much in the production so it kind of has these small wrinkles down here at the neck I think you'd be able to remove it by ironing at the t-shirt which is gentle something I really enjoy to do especially after washing my t-shirts is just give them a quick iron because it makes them look completely like new again so I hope this is something that you can remove by irony the t-shirt and it was made in a 95% organic cotton and then five percent ill estate and I can definitely tell when I move around in the fabric and I kind of I'm stretching like this that it's a bit more stretchy than the 100% cotton ones probably Everland so overall I really like this t-shirt I really like this very thick quality and the fact that it is hardly see through I bet you could even wear like a normal white bra underneath this t-shirt and you wouldn't be able to see it so that's definitely a plus but yeah it feels like a very proper great t-shirt oh yeah this is what I'm talking about when I say crewneck this is a proper crew neck in my opinion it just goes all the way up to the neck and it looks great with when you layer it your necklaces like this and yeah that is definitely a plus the one from organic basics is definitely a lot bigger than this one no doubt about that but it is definitely thicker than the very thin one from every lane so far this could actually be a favorite of mine I really like the neck I like the sleeves the perfect slightly oversized spit the sleeves are not too big they're not too long or anything so kind of has that boyfriend fit but not too much and yeah like I said it is made in 100% organic cotton so if you are to go for a sustainable basic from a normal high street brands and all the stories is definitely a great way to go so moving on this one is from weekday and kind of has a more corrupt and boxy fit than the others the others kind of went down to here that is definitely an individual matter but I definitely like my t-shirts to be slightly longer especially if I'm wearing boyfriend jeans like today where the jeans kind of sit low on my hip I just don't feel like there's a lot of fabric to kind of do this health tuck because it's so short if you're wearing high-waist jeans on the other hand there's not a lot of excess fabric so if that's what you prefer this length is perfect I guess also there's something odd about this color this one is what they call white on the website on weekdays websites but it is not white it is kind of like an off-white almost like a cream color I don't know if you can see it but I mean compared to this one from and other stories it's just not very white this one is also made in 100% organic cotton so again we're dealing with conventional brand that has kind of made an initiative to go for more sustainable basics the thickness of the fabric is great as well I don't really have anything bad to say about that I can see my bra I almost can't even see my jeans through this fabric as well so it has a great thickness so that is the fourth t-shirt take a good look because I'm gonna switch to the last one so here we have the final t-shirt this is from a brand called armed angels and it's a brand that I only recently discovered I've actually so ordered a pair of skinny jeans from that brand I'm gonna test out yeah this is 100% organic cotton as well and as you can see it is kind of more fitted than the other t-shirts so I guess this is what you would call like a woman's t-shirt so the sleeves are a bit more fitted and the body is a bit more fitted kind of sewn like a woman's body and like I said in the beginning I really prefer this kind of straight oversized fit so when it comes to the fit I am not completely sold on this one however I will say the length is really great at this t-shirt and also I think it's perfect to be wearing underneath Blazers because it is that fitted but to be wearing like this on its own it's not my favorite oh yeah I am gonna return once I have watched all of these t-shirts [Music] so it is now the day after I spoke to you last and I'm out back with a final conclusion to these five different white t-shirts so the conclusion is that all of the five t-shirts did really well in washing after a bit of ironing when they were dry they all have a very smooth surface and there doesn't seem to be a problem with moving seams or anything like that but obviously it takes a bit more than just one wash and also a bit more wear to really tell a difference but it doesn't seem like the surface will be peeling or anything so they're all super smooth still looks great and they did really well in terms of washing so one thing to think about in this process is definitely that cotton isn't just cutting you can really feel a difference in softness and weight if you turn to brands who are concerned about making cotton items in supima or pima cotton or cotton that are made from long fiber cotton so the reason why a long fiber cotton and supima cotton is so great is because you just get a lot thicker cotton a lot more durable and a lot more soft cotton as well they all have some pros and cons but if I have to pick out my own favorites it will have to be the one that I'm wearing right now which is the one from organic basics or the one from and Other Stories which is closely followed by one from every Lane so I really wish that you could feel the hand feel of this t-shirt from organic basics it's just so incredibly soft and I think it has to do with a tiny bit of stretch it just sits so nice and soft on your body and I like this kind of stretchy hand feel and also the thickness and the weight of the fabric and then after washing it and ironing the neckline I managed to smooth out these little wrinkles that have had right here so I think it will look great after countless times of washing and wear as well so if we look at both the t-shirt from and other stories made an organic cotton 100% organic cotton and then this one from organic basics they both kind of fill in the criterias that we made in the beginning of this video for the perfect basic white t-shirt so that was that the fabric shouldn't be to slinky but not too stiff either this one is definitely a lot more soft than this one because this one is after all 100% cotton and this has a tiny bit of stretch so there is definitely a difference in the softness of the t-shirt but the weight is quite similar to both of them then they both have this slightly oversized boxy fit with a classic crewneck that I like so much they wash really well both of them the surface is still super smooth no moving seams or anything like that and then finally none of them are too see-through but like I said in the beginning of this video it all starts with a great nude bra I really like the one from every lane as well like I said in the beginning I've had this for a while I've had it for around six months and it's been worn a lot washed a bunch of times too and it just keeps looking great the surface hasn't start started to peel or anything like that it's still super smooth the seams are where they should be in the sides of the t-shirt so this is really in my top three of all of these t-shirts because it just lasts so well and that is because it is made in soupy McCubbin so that just shows that cotton is not just cuttin you have to pick carefully if you want something that looks nice in the long run and that's really durable as well but the reason why it's not my absolute favorite is because it is just a bit too thin compared to these two this one and this one so my absolute favorites the one from another stories and then this one from our basics [Music] when it comes to caring for especially white t-shirts we all know that through time you can kind of get these yellow stains in the armpits which is just totally unsexy but it happens you can actually easily remove these stains by mixing a bit of baking soda with water so that it kind of creates a paste and then kind of scrub that into the surface or where the stain is and then leave it there for at least one hour you could also leave it overnight if you're dealing with a very rough kind of stain and then wash it normally and then that should take that yellow stain right off your t-shirt another thing you could do to avoid these yellow stains is going for a more and natural deodorant so stay away from antiperspirant a crystal deodorant or maybe make your own I'll make sure to put a link down below for a recipe for making your own deodorant I have experienced that the crystal deodorant is not always very efficient I sweat more through certain periods during the month and also if I'm really busy or stressed out I tend to sweat a bit more and having to worry about the smell of sweat it's just not fun either so I actually have both a crystal deodorant for kind of low-key days or if days at home where I don't need as much protection and then I also have a traditional antiperspirant but just without any nasty chemicals and without perfume so that it's better for very sensitive skin and it's just a bit more healthy than the conventional antiperspirant so that's it for this video guys I really hope you found it helpful and that it kind of made you wiser in terms of cotton in general and choosing great durable qualities also in terms of choosing more sustainable options again like I said in the beginning of this video going for sustainable eco-friendly basics is a great way to start other than lowering your consumption and maybe going for secondhand as well personally I don't even think that it's that much more expensive than the conventional brand so really everyone can do this especially if you lower your consumption you have a bit more money to go for great quality and more sustainable options as well so enough blabbering I think this video is getting a lot longer than I thought in the beginning so I'm gonna wrap up this video if you liked it please don't forget to give me a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel I'd love to have you around also make sure to follow me on Instagram because I upload daily outfit inspiration from my capsule wardrobes and thank you guys so much for watching and I will see you all in the next one bye guys [Music]", "p6PMvht5z6k": "\u200bToday we're talking about the American\nApparel 2001 100% Ring Spun Cotton Fine Jersey t-shirt. Now this t-shirt is the t-shirt that\nstarted the entire soft t-shirt revolution. I say that because this was the first shirt\nto be soft. Back in the day, it's hard to believe, but we all grew up with shirts that\nwere stiff. It felt like you were wearing cardboard. This was the first shirt to actually\ncome out and offer a soft fabric, and not only a soft fabric, but a great fit, tailored\nfit. \u200bAs we talk about this here today, just\nthink about that. It dates the shirt a little, and it makes it one of our favorite shirts.\nInstead of just telling you though, we do have one of our models coming over and going\nto talk about this on him. \u200bYou can see, right away you're going to\nnote this side here there is no side seam on the side because it's perfect for this\nwrap logo. This is only one of the only unisex t-shirts, besides our 100% cotton t-shirt,\nbottom of the line, standard economical t-shirts that doesn't have a side seam, so perfect\nif you need a wrap. \u200bThe next thing you're going to notice though\nis though it does have a great fit, it's not boxy, because this shirt, although it is one\nbig wind, it's one fabric, it doesn't have that boxy feel. Love that about this shirt.\n\u200bThe neckline is standard crew neck length here, the sleeves, mid to high bicep, awesome\nplacement here, very flattering, great statement shirt. 100% ring spun fine jersey t-shirt\nmaterial. This shirt breathes great, feels great.\n\u200bIn terms of the price point, it's a little more expensive than the Next Level and Canvas\n100% ring spun, and just that top of the line 100% ring spun material. If you're getting\nthis, you know you're getting the top of the line 100% cotton, made in America as all American\nApparel is. We love this shirt, it comes in a ton of colors, also comes in a comparable\nladies style if you're looking for companion style. If you have a big group of people that\nwant to order ladies and unisex, this is your shirt to go with.\n\u200bAlso, if you're thinking about care instructions, we're talking 100% ring spun cotton here.\nOver the course of its life, we're talking a year, two years down the line, it could\nstart pilling. 100% cotton, we always like giving that disclaimer that if you're going\nto dry this thing on high every wash, it could start shrinking, or just distorting. We don't\nrecommend washing it and drying it on high temperatures. Keep it on low to mid, and it's\ngoing to last a lot longer. \u200bIf you are looking to order for a staff\nat your business or restaurant, or volunteer organization that they're going to wear on\nweek after week, definitely bump it up to the 50/50 or 50/25/25 blend, it's going to\nlast a lot longer. \u200bAs you can see, it fits great, it feels\ngreat, we love this shirt for so many reasons, and I guarantee when you try it on, when you\nexperience this, just like I literally think millions of people have done since the early\n2000's, you'll know why this one t-shirt started the entire soft t-shirt revolution. You're\ngoing to love it, Tyler you look amazing in it, thank you. \u200bOn the Coed Monkey soft scale, we rate this t-shirt a 2. Thanks for watching this\nvideo, please let us know if you have any questions because here at Coed Monkey, soft\nmatters, and so do our customers.", "hsDbQ05k5gE": "what is up everyone i hope you're doing well spring is just around the corner so i thought it was about time to start getting some basic tees in place for the warmer weather you probably all know by now that uniqlo is my go-to when it comes to affordable basics what you get for the price is unbeatable in my opinion so for this week's video i decided to pick up the most popular and most talked about t-shirts i'm gonna try them on and talk about what i like about each one and what i don't like about each one i'm six foot and about 73 kilograms and i picked all of the t-shirts up in a size medium which is my true size i'll let you know which one's my favorite and which ones i don't like so much at the end of the video i've also measured each of the t-shirts just to give you more accurate information on how they differ in size but anyway without wasting any more time let's get straight into the first t-shirt so the first t-shirt that i've got is the crewneck supima cotton tee in white the first thing that i noticed is the color seems to be a bit more of an off-white than a pure white which i happen to like but it may not be what you want when ordering a white tee the quality feels lovely and the tea is so soft just what you'd expect from cp mccotton this tea comes in at 27.5 inches long a width of 20 inches from pit to pit and a sleeve length of 9 inches so let's have a look at how the tee fits the first thing that i noticed is the neck opening is a lot wider than i was expecting apparently they've updated this tee to have a slightly more relaxed fit so that's probably why i usually like a tight-fitting neck with my tees but i actually don't mind the wider neck here and i think it will look decent underneath an open shirt or a jacket this tee in the white is also slightly see-through not enough to the point where i wouldn't wear it but it may be for you if you don't like this then maybe opt for a darker color in this tee all in all it feels beautiful the quality is there but for me the fit is a little off i think i could have probably sized up with this tee for a more relaxed look but i'd still wear it as it is the next t-shirt we've got is the airism oversized u-range tee in black this is a very soft feeling tee and actually a bit thicker than i was expecting the quality feels really nice and i already know this is going to be comfortable this tee is made from 53 cotton 30 polyester and 17 elasto multiester this t-shirt comes in at 12 pound 90 and i think that's a very decent price for this tee this team measures 28 inches long a width of 22 inches and a sleeve length of 10.5 inches the tee is so soft and it has a decent weight to it this one may be even more comfortable than the supima cotton t2 the quality feels great and this tee fits me really well for an oversized tee the sleeve length and the body length ratio is perfect for me sometimes tees can have massive sleeves and then too much of a crop in the body which some people do prefer but for me this is the perfect balance for an oversized tee the neckline is really soft just like the rest of the tee and it fits snug to my neck this tea also has a drop shoulder for an even more relaxed look and i really like this feature on this tee all in all i'm really impressed with this t-shirt and for the price you may not find anything better for an oversized tee however we do have another oversized tee coming up next so maybe that'll beat this one next up we have another oversized tee from the u range that i picked up in this petrol blue color it features a pocket on the front and a split at the hem which are nice additional details this one is made from 100 cotton but it feels a lot stiffer than the other teas on the list i don't actually mind a stiff tee when it's in a heavy weight material and i actually prefer that so it's not a problem for me this tea also comes in at 12p90 which is an absolute bargain for a tea like this due to the split hem there's different lengths at the back of the front of this t-shirt the t mesh is 27 inches long at the front and 27.5 inches at the back it's got a width of 23 inches and a sleeve length of 10 inches so now moving on to the fit the tee has a generous boxy fit oversized sleeves and a slightly shorter length in the body i'm aware this tea is designed to be a bit shorter at the front in the body but for me i'd like an extra inch of length so maybe sizing up a size would work better for me it's nowhere near as comfortable as the airism tea but that's not really surprising the neck is softer than the rest of the t-shirt though so that's a nice touch and you don't have to worry about it rubbing i'm in love with the colour and the details of this tea but for me the tea doesn't sit as well on me as the airism tea does the final tea we've got here is the ut this is a classic tea and one of the first styles i ever picked up from uniqlo the ut is made from 100 cotton and it has a bit of a heavyweight feel to it like the previous t it's got a bit of a rough feel to it too and although that doesn't bother me it's definitely worth mentioning this one also comes in at 12 pound 90 which seems about average for a u-range t from uniqlo the team meshes in at 28 inches long a width of 22 inches and a sleeve length of nine inches like most of the u-range products this tee has a slightly relaxed fit which i really like i feel this tee fits me perfectly and sits well on my body i've had a few of these tees in the past and i feel the material is slightly thinner on this newer model for some of you in the warmer countries this may be a good thing but i always prefer a thicker tee the neckline is ribbed and it has a nice tight fit to my neck which i really like the thicker neck also means you don't have to worry about the neckline getting misshapen in the wash the length and the sleeve length is spot on for me although the sleeves are a little floppy all in all this tee fits me really well and i'm really happy with the way it looks so for me each t-shirt serves a different purpose if i wanted to wear any of these t-shirts as an undershirt then the one that wins it for me would be the supima cotton t-shirt for an oversized tee i would go for the airism tee the fit on this t-shirt is lovely and it's so comfortable too i love the color and the details on the oversized pocket t-shirt but the fit on me is just not quite right and i do prefer the airism oversized tee over this t-shirt and last but not least the best all-rounder in my opinion is the uniqlo ut the fit is spot on with this tee and although it's not perfect there are a couple of things that i would change i don't think you can beat this t-shirt for the price and it's probably the one that i'll be wearing the most in the spring and the summer months but whichever t-shirt that you go for you can't really go wrong they're all great for the price so choose the one that suits you best but i hope this video has helped you out and help you decide which one you want to get maybe just pick up all of them if you can't decide like i did and let me know your favorite down in the comments but anyway as always thanks so much for watching please do give the video a like if you enjoyed it hit subscribe if you're new and i will see you next week see ya", "55sBAIKk9m4": "oh so soft so supple oh i i just want to caress you it wait a minute this is a t-shirt let's get into this video the quintessential and definitive guide to choosing a t-shirt plane t-shirt help desk what's up guys gary is in a make sure you go down and click on that subscribe button and click that notification bell and if you're watching on instagram or facebook follow us so you'll be notified of all this fantastic information we have on the t-shirt industry now i know a lot of you guys are dead set you know exactly what t-shirt company you're gonna use to get your blanks from and some of you guys are undecided and this is why this video is being made and for some of you guys who are dead set you might see something that may uh change your mind now in this video we're going to be focusing on three main key points when it comes to a t-shirt blank fit feel and price now we're going to be covering quite a few t-shirts in this video so it may be a little lengthy so i took some time and created time stamps for each brand and that's going to be down in the description box okay so something piques your interest you can go right directly to that brand but i strongly suggest that you watch this video in its entirety so enough with all this talking without any further ado roll that beautiful bean footage here we go okay guys this is the ideal by next level you can see all the style number information down in the left corner this is what it fits like on the model we're just gonna lay it out and we're gonna give it the old uh feel test and it feels nice uh it's mediocre it's not the softest and it's not the scratches so it's like kind of right in the middle and it has that uh rip away label which is always good and it says ideal and not next level i don't know why and this is what it looks like uh from the back now the price is 366. and please note you probably can get these cheaper if you go direct to the manufacturer so here we are anvil and as you can see the fit is nice it's a standard fits a little bit more athletic but just slightly boxy but nice the feel is very nice i would say um out of five i would give it like a four uh uh three and a half three point five out of five you know somewhat soft you know and slightly above average all right it has that rip away tag so you can do your branding okay very nice um and here is the back this is the back uh how it looks okay really nice and the price is 326 okay of course you might get it a little bit cheaper now price in general something you want to take into consideration if it's a bottom of the barrel t-shirt um then you want to get a t-shirt that's less expensive so you can even in that lower price you can have some room to make a profit and if you're selling a more premium t-shirt then you want to get a better quality blank to justify selling your t-shirt at a higher price and of course that blank is going to be a little bit more expensive but hey higher price more profit which means you can afford the more expensive blank let's go to the next one okay so this is jerseys okay we all know jerseys all right and it's a slightly thicker slightly thicker shirt so we're gonna spread this bad boy out and you're gonna see that it's nice you just saw the fit it's a nice fit it's um not too boxy not too athletic you know not too fitted nice shirt and a feel it's good it's it's a good middle of the road shirt you understand what i'm saying no complaints and you can see right here that there's no um side seam which is usually um the more athletic um shirts will have a side seam and right here you see that that is that rip away tag which is always a good sign for a blank all right now the field is the middle of the road it's middle of the road about a three out of a five and the price is 431 which is a little a little high and this is how it looks from the back that's jerseys fit all right guys fit this is so very important because depending on your demographic meaning your core target audience meaning the people who you are pushing your t-shirt company to they may want a different fit you may have a young hip demographic they may want a smaller tighter fit you may have a older demographic all right they may want a little bit of a boxier fit you may have an athletic demographic or you may be one of these people that's out here doing a line for people who are bodybuilders or crossfit or something like that then in that case you may want a more fitted tighter uh smaller waist v taper type fit for your t-shirts everything has to do with your core target audience and not all t-shirts are the same alright so fit is so very important all right and this is the hanes tagless shirt um and this one is the epitome to me in my opinion it's a dad's shirt it's a shirt that you just kinda it's just a shirt that you just kind of wear it's really not for screen printing you can see um it's really big and boxy all right and it's very thick a lot of you guys think that thick is a higher quality and not necessarily all right the feel is it's okay it's it's a mediocre and there's no um there's no side seam all right it's very hand feel it's very mediocre not too soft not rough though not rough and this is really important right here the the back neck tag is already heat pressed so you can't brand it so not a good look and um this is how it looks from the back you can see it's very big and boxy so um not for me my opinion not the best for starting a t-shirt business for obvious reason but it does have a pretty good price 279 and you probably could get it cheaper guys the tag the tag is so very important there was a time when hey whatever the brand of the t-shirt was they left their tag in and there was a time when you literally had to pay screen printers to cut the tag out so you could put your branding in it that's not the case anymore they make these t-shirts with mostly rip away tags so you can rip that tag out and put your own branding in there so i always want to call out what type of tag hopefully a rip away is in your blank tee also guys when you doing all the branding and you have your neck label and your hang tags and your boxes and everything matches guys that stuff looks so professional such a what's called perceived value you take your t-shirt line to a whole nother level baby all right guys alternative apparel very nice shirt first thing you're gonna see you're gonna notice that it is a little bit more fitted okay so a very nice fitting shirt all right let's lay it out and let's give it an initial just a field test and it it's very soft guys very soft very nice shirt okay uh you can get in there touch on that feels really good all right and also you're gonna see that it is a you can see that side seam right there which helps with the fit so we're already having some uh some premium things going on you can see that fit you know a little bit a little bit more tapered and fit it to the body and it has that rip away tag so this one is definitely a little bit more on the primo side all right and the price is about 385 okay um and of course you may be able to get a little bit cheaper at the actual website but alternative apparel really nice shirt all right guys this is the hanes nano tee this one totally came out of left field for me uh different than the haines tagless tee all right really nice fit and the fabric is really soft uh dynamite tee all right the fit is not quite um the super fitted but it fit really nice and you're gonna see right here that it has a really nice feel okay now right here you're gonna see that it does not have the side seam okay but it still managed to have a great fit and i think that has to do with the fabric it's a really light soft fabric so this nano t uh surprised me and uh you can see that it also has that rip away tag all right so um really nice and once again the feel was a really nice you almost can see how soft it is right surprise me right because i never heard of the nano t this is it from the back and the price is three dollars and eleven cent once again you might can get it cheaper from haynes uh themselves so that is the haines nano t okay so here we are fruit of the loom now this one kind of surprised me a little bit i thought it was going to be really bad and it wasn't the fabric is actually a nice feel not the best not the worst it's a light it's a light t-shirt guys it's a nice light t-shirt and it gets the job done if you want to just put something out there throw a screen print on it uh for the loom and of course it has the rip away tag all right which any good t-shirt should have and it was nice it felt good has a decent fit and i was presently surprised this is it from the back and the price was 3.49 i thought it could have been a little cheaper but hey you know i got it from a reseller so if you buy directly from fruit of the loom you may can get it cheaper all right on to the next one gildan or gildan all right this one is popular this is usually the shirt that you see that's the lowest price when you're choosing t-shirts on print on demand and there's a reason for that that's because the fabric is not very soft all right it's not nice it's not that nice feeling at all i mean it's okay after a couple of washes but initially um not the best feeling and that's why it's uh the least expensive um but it's a cool tee no side seam and the fit is it's okay um it's not boxy and it's it's not tapered or or like really fitted um fabric [Music] not the best feeling man not the best best feeling but it does have a rip away tag which is always good uh let's take a look at it from the back um cool t-shirt but um i would say low on lower on the quality scale and the price 279 so you can see it's a little bit less and you know hey you get what you pay for guys all right gildan next level check this one out now great thing about next level is look at the fit really great fit nice fitted to the body great i mean you can see it on the mannequin here so let's lay it out and um first you know we're going to give it a nice little feel and um it feels great it's really soft really nice all right it's um definitely a higher quality shirt and also you're gonna see right here that it too has a side seam okay which is a um telltale sign of a higher quality shirt and the rip away tag here it is from the back the price of 439 so uh it's a little bit it's it's up there all right it's up there but it is a higher quality more premium t-shirt next level bella canvas good old bella canvas you've heard about them several times here at t-shirt help desk great t-shirt really light airy soft fantastic t-shirt with a great fit alright and let's take a look as you guys should know bella canvas also has the side seam okay which gives it a really nice fit it's light it's not a heavy fabric and it's really really soft and of course it has the rip away tag and as stated previously bella is one of the softest on the market all right right up there with next level and in alternative apparel here it is from the back and the price 439 but that's from a middleman you can get it from bella canvas as most of these for about a dollar to 80 90 cents cheaper bella canvas next american apparel yes they are still around okay um they are really soft t-shirts really nice all right and just to let you know this t-shirt all the other ones were largest this one is a medium so if it seems extra snug that's because it is one size down okay but it does have a really good fit all right and it has that side seam okay so it is a more premium shirt with a nice fit okay this is it from the side you can see that it is a good slim fit all right and it yes has the rip away tag so great to brand with this is it from the back all right the price 392 all right so it's more on the premium side but a little bit less and like all the other ones if you go straight to the manufacturer you can get it for less all right guys as you can see all of the t-shirts are 100 cotton i didn't want to get into anything crazy i didn't want to get into the tri-blends or anything fancy schmancy like that that's gonna be for another video i wanted to keep it basic 100 cotton t-shirts but there is one exception i am going to show you guys one 100 polyester tee this is a great t-shirt for any of you guys who are doing active who are doing sports people who are working out golf anything where people may be working out and get sweaty because 100 polyester is a natural wicking fabric meaning that if you're sweating it naturally will kind of wick that sweat away and another thing about 100 polyester tees is that they are great for sublimation in fact really it's the only thing you really can use for sublimation all right so if you want to sublimate small and if you want to do those big all over sublimation tees you need a 100 or at least a very high polyester content but one little thing if you're doing sublimation this shirt has to be a light color preferably white all right so let me show you this is the jerseys dry power sport t-shirt great shirt and it feels like a regular t-shirt that's what's so great about it alright so this is it and it feels very similar to a standard jersey t-shirt if you didn't know the difference you probably couldn't tell and it is soft not the softest but it is a soft t-shirt in the back it doesn't have the rip away tag okay so um branding is gonna be a little bit tricky but um the price is also a little bit uh more 563 this is it from the back but if you want to do that athletic stuff this is the way to go that was a lot of t-shirts guys they were in no particular order i really wasn't trying to critique like that i just wanted to present them to you so you can make your decision on what's going to be in your t-shirt line now when it comes to actually purchasing these t-shirts you can go to each brand's respective website but please note a lot of these companies are going to require you to have a wholesale or a retail license they may want to see your website all right so you know you may have to do that but you're gonna get the absolute best prices now if you don't have that no worries you can go to places like jiffyshirts.com which is where i got all of these shirts okay they have you covered you don't need any of that stuff you can just go you can buy as little or as many as you like so anyway guys that's all i got for you today i'm gonna put some butt on my shoes and slide on out the dope cheers to your t-shirts start a t-shirt business or die trying and do something good for somebody and if you don't have anyone to do something good for do something good for yourself god bless and peace shirt man shirt man yeah that's me that's when you take your t-shirt line to a hoe damn that's taking it to another level baby", "ZV8VouSkfjE": "[Music] [Applause] YouTube family welcome back it's your first time here my name is Devin on deck I discuss fashion and tech here and today we're talking about or rather on a journey to discover the perfect black t-shirt now if you already know this channel you know my favorite color to wear is black especially when it comes to my basics and over the years I have tried the hell of different t-shirts and I feel like I'm getting really close to find the perfect one but I would love your help in deciding so in this video I have six different teams from my closet from my drawer he's all been washed and dried from $5 all the way up to 95 I'm gonna try them on for you we're gonna go over talked about fit weight how things feel and the quality points and then hopefully by the end of the video we have a verdict [Music] now first up we have the unique little dry package teeth this is gonna cost you about five or six us and it was my favorite shirt up until recently now starting with the good things the price point is good the weight is great it's kind of like a poly-cotton blend so if you're really hot and run hot like I do when you sweat it dries up really quickly but for some reason recently they've been getting a little sloppy with the sizing like this is supposed to be a large on me and usually again I've been buying these charts for years but for some reason this one fits like a medium and a half like when I first put it on it was a tiny bit sluggish but it was fine but after watching and drying it it shrunk up on me so you see it's too short the sleeves are hella tight right now and it just doesn't fit me comfortably so I haven't really worn this shirt in a while but it used to be that you can wash and dry this and then fit fine so I don't know what's going on with these but they definitely are being replaced coincidentally by another shirt within the same company and that leads me to our next t-shirt the UT from Uniqlo it's gonna cost you about $10 USD but it's a total upgrade from the t-shirt from before the weight is amazing I love how this shirt feels when you have an on is very substantial you can tell a huge jump in quality from the dry package one from the previous shirt - this one right here the banded collar right there on the tee is a great touch you just like a fold over piece of fabric that makes a world of a difference as far as the collar goes it's nice and tight but not too tight and the only feedback I have is that the sleeves are a little bit loosey okay even when I cuff them there's still a little loose for me but I think this is a good trade-off to have a way heavier tee way more substantial tee and I would also say it's a little long ish but again not a big deal for me this is a great shirt everything's being consistent so far I've been buying these for the last few months and all the sizes are consistent and it stays black for a long time with the color fastness is really strong so thumbs up on this t-shirt I'm liking it so far now moving on up the price here we have this texture t-shirt by Zara now this is gonna be something you'll find here throughout the year they have different ones all the time and they'll run you around like 30 bucks and I love these t-shirts because they almost add a sophistication to your outfit so if you do want to wear a t-shirt but you want the same appeals like having a thin sweater or something a little bit more refined on then throw one of these on it's gonna look perfect and a little bit more dressy winter time I put an overcoat over it and it looks great or the spring summer when it's too hot for a jacket I can throw that on with like a pair of chinos or some slacks and like some minimal sneakers and have a great smart casual look that again it's a little bit more sophisticated than a regular t-shirt now I would say right now after watching like it's barely long enough before I actually watched you like the first where they fit perfectly bend is shrinking a little bit after washing and hang drying it but the sleeves are the great lip you don't have to really roll them but also it's a great t-shirt off the rack I suggest you look into them if you want something a little bit more elevated now this next t-shirt is in the premium category and it's by a brand called a sketch this is gonna cost you about 45 bucks but in my opinion for a premium t-shirt it is worth the price one of the first great things about a sket is you can pick a various sizing when you pick your size meaning that when I got a large I can pick a short a regular or along it since I am 6 1 then I have a long one and it fits me great now the sleeves are a little bit longer than I would like but I'm already asleep rolling guys so that's fine when you roll them they fit perfectly as far as like looseness and width around my arms it's great and if you look at the neckline I have that same overlapping hem similar to the Uniqlo you t-shirt but it's a little bit thinner and again it makes a shirt feel a little bit more substantial and elevates it in my opinion the fabric weight itself is kind of uh I would say medium heavy kind of a medium and a half as far as weight not super heavy and thick like I would like it like the Uniqlo $10 you shirt but it is very substantial and it does feel like a premium t-shirt so when you spend 45 bucks us on it you don't feel like you spin it much money so I will at least try one of these if you have Tim t-shirts in your closet maybe these are like two or three of them but I do recommend that this would be a good staple to have now as you move up the price tiers in the premium category we have a brand called Vince with your t-shirt coming in at $95 and the reason why I put premium in quotes is because the only thing premium about this is the price point this is a regular shirt it doesn't fit any different from any other insurance this list the weight is similar to the five dollar Uniqlo one it's like kind of a light medium ish weight so it feels a little I don't know not ninety five dollars it's kind of faded now and it's more of a gym shirt it's not really special everything else on this list right now I recommend way more than this t-shirt so now that we're double all the expensive shirts you're moving on to the very last one that I really believe belongs in a category all of this home it's from a company called lot it's more of a like a subscription service what I love about the subscription services you not only give me clothing you're getting accessories you're getting self-care items and everything is black black tees black crude names black pants black shoes and even black tutu brushes but as far as this t-shirt goes one of the best things about it that I love that is personalized with my name on it look at this it's a beautiful thing and the quality of the t-shirt is also very awesome I would say the weight of this t-shirt is probably the same as a premium weight from the skin team and I will say the only thing that I don't like about these is that I get it only once every other one instead of every month because I really love these t-shirts I wish I got I can give more I can get them in bulk but I just can't only can get one every other month but as far as thing and everything it's very comfortable I'm a big fan of it so I had to put it in this video but I would love to know from you what do you feel like is the best one on this list I would love to have been asked it cut but in the Uniqlo UT weight I love the heavy team

t-shirts from Uniqlo you guys already know how much I love Uniqlo I think they make amazing products amazing clothes prices that are affordable for most people and you guys also know how much I love plain white t-shirts I wear them pretty much every single day and in fact this one that I'm wearing right now is one of the ones that we'll be discussing in this video today the three white t-shirts that I chose for today's video are some of Uniqlo's most basic plain white t-shirts and I chose these because I think that they're the most versatile they don't have any pockets they're pretty basic in their cut and in their silhouette so I think that these are the ones that a lot of you guys will choose if you guys plan on buying some of these plain white t-shirts as well but if you guys want me to review some of uni clothes more Craigie or seasonal white t-shirts I can do those as well because I do own a few of those as well just let me know in the comment box down below and I'll be sure to make that happen also if you guys like this type of video go ahead and hit that thumbs up button because it really does help me out it helps more people find this video it helps the channel grow so I'd really really appreciate it the three shirts that I chose from Uniqlo are the package tri plain tee this is the crewneck version I also chose the FEMA cotton T which is the shirt that Uniqlo is very known for and the last one is the Uniqlo u crew neck shirt and before we get started I just want to mention that I am a little over 5 feet 9 inches as of making this video I'm around 165 pounds so that should give you guys an idea of how these shirts fit me and how they might fit you as well and yeah that's about it let's get started so the first shirt is this Uniqlo package dry crewneck shirt this also comes in a v-neck variation which should be similar if not exactly the same except for the collar and this is the cheapest shirt out of the three that I'm going to show you guys today coming in at around five dollars and ninety cents in the US and here in the Philippines where I'm from it comes in at 290 casos making it the most affordable out of the bunch and this is the one that I was actually the most excited about because I haven't tried the shirt the other two I do own so I've you know I have a lot of experience with it but this is my first time actually trying the shirt so yeah I'm really excited about it so I'm gonna start off with the things that I really really like about the shirt and right off the bat I love the fit of the shirt I like the length it falls around mid crotch for me you know this is where my belt is and I like the length of the sleeves as well they also are not too loose not too tight which I do like it's very it's a very regular fit but it fits really nicely and I'm actually very happily surprised about how the shirt feels so yeah I'm really happy about the fit of the shirt the next thing you'll notice is the sort of the quality or the thickness of the material itself and in comparison to the supima tee that I'm used to this is thinner and you could also say it's a little rougher than the supima tee which may not necessarily be a bad thing because if you're not comparing the two side-by-side you won't really notice the difference because it is still very soft now it is also a little thinner so as you can see it's a little see-through that may or may not be a deal-breaker for you for me it's not particularly you know too much of a negative and in fact in the Philippines ran from sometimes these lighter materials even if they're technically not as good as heavier weight materials can be really nice in the heat you know walking around outside so yeah I really really really really dig the shirt overall I'm very very pleased with this I think it's a very first house shirt you can use it for a lot of things yeah that's pretty much it I really like the shirt and at the price I don't think you wrong with with this with a shirt at all the next t-shirt is the supima cotton tee from Uniqlo this is the famous two pima cotton tee it's very very soft it's very very nice and this in particular is my everyday white t-shirt this one comes in at around nine dollars and ninety cents u.s. and here in the philippines it comes at five hundred and ninety pesos making it sort of the middle range between all these three shirt shirts but yeah I really love the shirt again it's my everyday shirt very very comfortable so let's just get straight into the look in the field first off right off the bat you'll see that the length is very similar to the previous tee to the dry package tee it comes down around mid crotch here the sleeves come around mid bicep and again not too tight not too loose the shoulders are just the right size for me this is a large by the way so all of the shirts that I'm fitting today are large because I'm generally a little bit bigger in the chest and in the shoulders yeah very very nice now in comparison to the previous shirt this is very noticeably a lot softer and a lot thicker in terms of material I did buy a brand new one because I do have a bunch of these but you know there are shirts that have been wearing for a long time now so I wanted to make this video with a brand new shirt just to see how one feels right off the bat and there it is super nice you can see it's not really transparent if it is it's very very little and you know it takes a lot to see that so it is a lot of thicker a lot softer and it feels a lot more durable than the first one but again you know it really depends if what you're looking for if you wear your white tee shirts a lot what you're gonna use them for so if you don't wear your white t-shirt often and you just want to have one in the closet you know you can go either of two ways you can just get this one which is a little bit more expensive but since you don't wear too much and you know you're not going to be spending a lot on my t-shirts you might want to spend a little bit more for this so that when you do wear it it is you know a little nicer a little bit more durable or you can go the other way you wear you know since you don't wear too much you don't really care for that slight bit of extra durability and quality you might just go with the cheaper one they're both great options at this point what I can say is that I'm not sure how the packaged dry shirt wear is over time but for me in particular I have a bunch of these supima shirts some of them are some of them are actually maybe two or more years old and I still wear them until today they fit very well still they basically lasted a long time especially you know this year where I'm wearing white t-shirts almost every day they've they've been very very good so that's it that is number two the supima cotton tee from Uniqlo the third and final shirt of the bunch is this one this is the newest shirt of the bunch in terms of when they came out this is the Uniqlo u crew neck shirt short sleeve tunic shirt and there are many differences between the shirt and the other two shirts but I think that this is one of the shirts that they might keep in their lineup for a long time so I decided to show you guys this shirt as well now this shirt is also a large and in terms of price it comes in at around fourteen dollars and ninety cents in the US but the strange thing is here in the Philippines this comes in at the same price as a subcommittee at around five hundred and ninety pesos so I think we're pretty lucky here in the Philippines for that to be the case and I don't really know why that is but I'm pretty happy about it so again this is the Uniqlo u crew neck shirt short sleeve crew neck shirt and the big difference between this and the other shirts are I think what Uniqlo is going with the shirt is they were trying to do sort of a more retro feeling plain shirt and they do that through having this thicker material so the other two are sort of a soft more modern material I guess you could call it a more modern blend making it very soft making making it comfortable but this one purposely gives you a rough texture a heavy material giving you that sort of more more retro feel the shape is also not as form-fitting as the previous two it's a little bit more boxy as you guys can see the sleeves are a little tiny bit longer tiny bit looser so was the body area and again this is a large but it's supposed to fit that way it dropped a little lower in the crotch and yeah it's a little heavier a little rougher but I do like the shirt because it gives you that you know it gives you that retro look it's a completely different look it looks very very relaxed and as you guys know I love wearing cargo shorts and sure it fits the aesthetic really well so if you guys are more laid-back and you like this casual retro look the shirt might be the one for you now even though this shirt is heavier is thicker it's not like the thickest thing in the world and there is a certain level of lightness to it so they could have made this a lot thicker but they didn't which I actually do really really appreciate especially again here in the Philippines with all the heat yeah here's here's how it looks super nice super comfortable and this is one of the shirts that are in my er rotation I actually only have one of these in my current rotation so I'm happy to have another one after purchasing this one so this is nice some of you guys might actually like the shirt more than the other two and I think that's you know not a bad thing it's a great option there you go so that's it guys that is my comparison of the three plain white tee shirts from Uniqlo the package dry shirt the supima cotton tee as well as this the Uniqlo u crew neck shirt if you guys found this helpful if you guys enjoyed the video let me know by giving me a thumbs up and if you guys want to see reviews of more seasonal shirts from Uniqlo leave those in the comment box down below I'll be sure to make those happen if you guys want me to and yeah that's it for this video subscribe if you haven't yet I'll leave links down below to everything that I mentioned this video and I'll see you guys super super soon", "mujpNxavalk": "what's going on guys i hope everyone is having a great day now in today's video i wanted to cover one of the basic essentials that i guarantee each of you already own i'm talking more basic than bathroom selfies vineyard vines and yes even more basic than all of them becky's out there in the world and of course we're talking about plain tees now everyone knows how essential plain tees are to every man's wardrobe because of their simplicity and versatility with that being said everyone knows that it's nearly impossible to find the perfect tee but your boy is like mj and i took that statement personally that's why in this video i'll be going over six t-shirts all at different price points in the hopes of finding the best tee now keep in mind that my rankings especially when it comes to fit is based off of my preferences and my body type so make sure to make your own judgments as well i will provide the sizes that i bought as well as my upper body measurements throughout the video so that you can easily compare and make those judgments in terms of my ranking system i will give each tea a score of 1 to 10 that will take into account fit quality and overall value but before i begin if at any point throughout the video you like it or find it to be informative i would really appreciate it if you gave the video a thumbs up so without further ado the first tee that i have here is the everlane air crew tea and i got this one in a size small this tea comes in at a price of 24 which is right in the middle of the pack compared to all the other teas now by just holding this tea i can tell that it's extremely lightweight and a bit on the thinner side now when looking at the fit this shirt actually fits pretty well which honestly is not what i expected the shirt has a nice slim fit through the chest and waist without being overly tight and the arm sleeves are nice and tapered with an overall solid sleeve length it could maybe be a half inch shorter if i wanted the perfect fit but this length is more than satisfactory the only thing i will say is that the collar is a tad wide for me but i also just have a smaller neck at 14.5 inches so that may just be a me problem now judging the quality this tee is made of 100 cotton and is purposely woven loosely in an uneven sub texture for extra breathability while the breathability and lightweight features are a plus i can definitely feel like this can shrink up on you if you don't hang dry the tee so you may just want to be extra careful when washing now maybe i'm just not used to extremely lightweight tees but i feel like i have to be extra gentle when taking this shirt off because when i try to take it off the first time normally i felt like i was almost going to rip the shirt again i'm just not the biggest fan of lightweight tees as one of my basic essentials so i have to mark it down a few points for quality with that being said i'll probably rate this t a 7.5 out of 10 because even though the shirt is lightweight and can tear a little bit easier i feel like the fit is actually really great besides just a slightly loose collar now the second tee that i have is the madewell tri-blend all-day crewneck tee and this shirt comes in at 29.50 this tea has a little bit of a rougher texture on the exterior but we'll see if the interior has a different feel but first when it comes to fit this tee fits extremely well the chest width is basically perfect for my body type and the length is great as well i would say that it runs just slightly on the longer end but definitely isn't major the arm sleeve link sticks right around mid bicep which i do like but the only thing i'll say is that i wish the arm width was just a quarter or half inch smaller to fit nice and snug on my arm now when it comes to the quality this tee is made from a cotton polyester blend so it definitely does have a little bit of stretch to it now while i said earlier that the outer layer texture is a bit rough i didn't find any discomfort when actually wearing the shirt i wouldn't consider the shirt to be extremely soft but it definitely is comfortable enough to wear regularly and then lastly i would consider the shirt to be a medium weight and so it definitely will keep its shape and isn't flimsy and with all that being said i'd give this tea for madewell a solid 8 out of 10. the main reason why i had to mark it down a few points is because i feel like this would be better priced at 20 rather than 30 and so the overall value is a little bit lower and now the next tea that i have for you guys is the men's premium tea from talentless and this tea comes in at 39 right off the bat i can tell that this tea has a premium feel to it because it's much softer than the other two teas now when it comes to the fit though this shirt is not what i expected at all the shirt description stated that it has a relaxed fit and so i'm either extremely chunky or this tee is definitely more of a slim tapered fit i actually do like the width at the hips and waist but the chest area and the armholes especially are definitely a bit too tight for my liking i can definitely feel my arms losing blood circulation because of how tight the t is and so i would say to recommend sizing up but the thing is if you're short a guy like me at five feet six inches the size small i have here is a bit long and i can only imagine how much longer a size medium would be now when assessing the quality it truly does feel extremely premium and has a ridiculously soft feel for a garment dyed cotton fabric the collar is nicely ribbed and so there is a bit of stretch to it making it much easier to put on but then the collar quickly compresses again right after and wraps up tightly around your neck honestly if this shirt just fit me better i'd be going crazy over this tee because of the quality you're getting at this price point however because that isn't the case and fit is extremely important when it comes to basic tees i have to rate this tee a 7 out of 10. now the next tee that i have is the t-shirt from ask it and this is priced at 45. now the great thing about ascot is that they actually offer 15 different sizes from extra small to extra large with length options of short regular and long i chose to go with the size small and the short length because i am on the shorter side but as you will see i wish i had gotten the regular length when looking at the fit this shirt for me almost fits to perfection but the only thing that is stopping it from fitting perfectly is the shirt length i'm going to try and return this for the regular length because everything else truly fits great i love both the chest and arm sleeve widths and the sleeve length is at my preferred length as well hopefully when i return this for the regular length version this tee will fit perfectly when it comes to the quality of the shirt it definitely is more of a premium heavyweight cotton fabric which will definitely make this shirt extremely durable now i will say that the shirt isn't as soft or comfortable as the tailless tee that i just tried on but it has a similar or better feel than all the other tees in this video and then this tea similarly to the talentless tee also has a nice ribbed neckline that really conforms to your neck with now overall with this shirt i'll have to give it an 8.5 out of 10 because of the fit and the premium quality but i hope that when i return this for the size small in the regular length i'll be able to grade it up to a 9 or a 9.5 now the fifth tee that i have here is a uniqlo supima cotton tee and this tee comes in at 14.90 now at 15 bucks this tee has a pretty nice overall fit but i'll judge it objectively like i did with all the other tees the chest measurement of this shirt fits perfectly on my body and the shirt length is also perfect sitting right around mid crotch a few shortcomings of this tea though has to be the slightly looser neckline as well as slightly loose armholes when it comes to the quality the shirt is made with 100 supima cotton and has a nice smooth texture finish i would consider this tee to be a medium weight and that is not nearly as lightweight as the everlane tee but it is definitely lighter than the ascit and talentless tees in terms of comfortability i wouldn't say that it's jaw-dropping comfortable but it definitely still is comfortable enough to wear regularly as an essential piece and with this tee only coming in at 15 i would say that this tee has the best value meaning you get the best bang for your buck however with that being said the t isn't perfect and so i have to rate it a 9 out of 10. now the last that i have is a jersey t-shirt from todd snyder and this one is in a size small this tee comes in at a whopping price of 68 and so we'll see if the fit and quality warrant this higher price looking at the fit i'm a bit torn because there are a few things i love about this tee but then there are also some small deal breakers i love the chest width as it's a comfortable slim fit and i also love the width of the arms however it would be a tiny bit better if it was just a quarter inch looser the neckline is just a bit too loose for my liking and the length of the shirt is also a bit on the longer end now when it comes to the quality that's an entirely different story while i can argue that the ascit or tailless tee has the most premium feel this tee is a very close second but it's by far the softest tee out of all of them they use 100 garment dyed cotton jersey fabric which is the reason why this tee not only has an extremely premium feel but is also super soft and stretchy because of the jersey fabric if this tee had a perfect fit then i would maybe consider it as one of the top tees in this list but because the fit isn't that great and the price is astronomical the overall value of the shirt decreases and i would have to rate it a 6 out of 10. alright so now that we got through all the teas let's see how each tee ranked up against each other now remember that my rankings take into account fit quality and overall value but also keep in mind that something that may not have fit me well may actually fit you great so hopefully you can make that comparison so coming in last place with a score of 6 out of 10 or 60 we have the todd snyder t now if we were using the asian grading scale with these scores then this would be a d and if you're asian you would know that this stands for don't come home if you don't get the joke this basically means that you gotta score so low that your parents don't even think that you deserve to come home but luckily i'm not that ruthless when it comes to grading and i actually think that this can find itself in people's homes because of how soft and high quality the tea is but because the tea just didn't fit my body type well and it's also priced at 68 dollars i had to rank it last on my list now in fifth place we have the men's premium tea from talentless which got a score of 7 out of 10. now i will preface this by saying that if the t did fit me better it would definitely be in the top three but because the t was a bit long and a little too tight for me as well as being the second most expensive option at 39 i had to ring it fifth on my list moving on to fourth place with the score of 7.5 out of 10 we have the everlane air crew tee now the fit of this tee was nearly perfect but because this tee just didn't feel as durable because of the lighter weight this tea isn't one that i would keep now finishing it in the top three is the madewell tri-blend all-day crewneck tea which received a score of 8 out of 10. this tea had a very similar feel and fit to the uniqlo tee but was just double the price which is why i had to rank it third now finishing as a runner up we have the asget t-shirt which received a score of 8.5 out of 10. now while this technically finished second i would consider it more of a 1b because it really depends on whether you prefer quality or affordability the t is quite expensive at 45 but the quality is seriously amazing and the fit is great too again the only issue that i had was the length and that was my fault because i chose to go with the shorter length rather than the regular length but i'm going to exchange it for the regular size small and i'm expecting the fit to be perfect but lastly coming in first place in terms of the best bang for your buck it has to be the uniqlo pima cotton tea the tea is priced at 14.90 but it often goes on sale for 9.90 and the fit and quality are great you really can't find a better fitting tee at this price point and so if you want an affordable yet still very high quality tea then i would definitely recommend to go with the uniqlo supima cotton tea now again those are just my rankings and so i'd love to hear your thoughts and your own rankings based off what you saw in this video let me know down in the comments if you agree or just think that i'm crazy and now that's all that i have for you guys in today's video hopefully this video helped you guys find the right basic tee for your body type and budget if it did i would greatly appreciate it if you gave this video a thumbs up and if you want to see more content similar to this in the future feel free to subscribe to my channel as i post videos every week as always thanks for watching and i'll see you next time", "1P5-Lni5TSI": "a lot of people view fashion as like a very exclusive thing and it's only for like a certain kind of woman but that's not true we all wear clothes all the time and fashion can be used as a wellness tool it makes us feel good when we look good and it doesn't have to be like these really intense crazy looks it's just wearing stuff that makes you feel comfortable it makes you feel you yeah I want to bring that to different [Music] [Music] we are not sisters we like 10 we are both of our moms names are actually Debbie Miller but we have you guys yeah we actually met at school we lived on the same floor freshman year yeah and that was that and the rest is history where did you go to school are you from we went to Indiana University and we're both from Chicago yeah but we just didn't meet until college but we live ten minutes from each other so it's really funny yeah I love that were destined to be Frank wait I also forgot to tell me what you guys both do for a living so I'm a photo producer at her such as how we know each other yeah you styled so many amazing shoots for us so I work on all the digital co-branded content for Hearst I don't know what do you do so I am a buyer at cath and I buy all the men's multi brand apparel so fun is that what your style is kind of sporty so that's why yeah my style Lewin's I've been influenced heavily but I think in a good way okay Hanna how would you describe your personal style I would say mine is a mix of casual pieces with something a little more feminine and wear a lot of dresses because I just think that's so easy in the summer but I also love just like a vintage denim with a white button-up like I just love that love with like cool jewelry it's like depends on my mood but I wear a lot of like miniskirts and sexy yeah sexy girly how would you describe your style so I think my style has really evolved and still is but I would say very sporty but mixed with some very feminine pieces so I love wearing like bike shorts and then with like a cute little mule so I really like to just add in different genres of my style and mix it all together funny because you are different style wise but you guys are so similar you're the exact same height you have the same last name your mom's have the same first name but totally different body types totally different styles but I want to try on a bunch of different white t-shirts and see what works for Hannah what works for Lana and just kind of understand why and what's the best way to shirt for each of you so I feel like that's a great thing to have in everybody's wardrobe yeah yeah for myself that's the hardest thing for me to find and that's still to this day cannot find a way to shirt I like so good challenge hypocrite as a good challenge great do you wear a lot of t-shirts always okay always wear a t-shirt to work okay perfect I need to find a good white bun alright great so let's try on some white t-shirt stay let it do it I feel like the white t-shirt is like a blank canvas in which to portray whatever you want put a white t-shirt under like a blazer or a sweater or sweatshirt or any kind of jacket it's just like something to reflect your personal style and how you're feeling so that being said I want to try some weight shirts on you guys and I want to because you guys are both the same height but totally different bodies I want to try the same shirts on you both and then see like what works on Alanna what works on Hannah and why and sort of talked about that the first step t-shirt I want to try is the Madewell whisper cotton t-shirt and I'm gonna give Elana is small and Hannah a medium and I think this is an amazing one because it's a bit of like that burnout style it's a little bit see-through I think it's gonna be cute and I think the neckline is good we're anxiously waiting let's see oh my god my little twinsies I actually love this you've never really Miller sister sisters yeah there's a lot looks really good on you both I would you like a little front tuck or maybe a - yeah aren't you guys usually tuck yeah I usually talk about okay let's hide this little tag wait hem I actually think this one works really well for you and you can't really see the bra even though it is like that see through sort of textured fabric you can't see the broad what are you wearing I'm wearing Natori I have a little lacing here but you can't even see it no it looks perfect and I think that with people with a larger chest if it's really high necked it doesn't look good and this is like it still has the illusion of being a crewneck it's a little bit lower and it's also a drop shoulder which is helpful cause it's not necessarily like a long sleeve but it kind of gives the illusion of the longer sleeve and I think this looks great on you too I love it how do you feel in this way I like it it's like comfortable you're they see your bra more than you yeah I feel like you can and for you since you are what size are you Ches 32 a 32 a I think for something like for you if you can see the bra through I would just go for something like lacy so if you can see it it's like just give them something nice to look at I guess so I would try it actually for you with like a black lacy bra underneath as opposed to something with padding I think this works great for both of you yeah okay great okay next I want to try something that I think will probably be really nice and a lot I'm not sure about Hannah this is has a higher crew neck it's the Hanes by Carla I think for somebody like Hannah or I with a bigger chest it might be less flattering because it's higher and I think it's gonna be good on the Lana but let's try it and see what is these for Barbie yeah it looks okay so come on out I think I think I was right I think this is good for somebody like Alana I would actually even so Alana is in a size small and Hannah's in a size medium I would even put along in a size medium so in this shirt I would size up one something if you have larger breasts like or I something high-neck it just it's not flattering and it's definitely more form-fitting which I don't like in a white tee like I want it to be very loose and comfortable exactly this is like made for a Barbie I like how thick it is and I like that a super opaque like you can't see your bra or anything but it's just it's not it's not the right fit for something with a larger chest I like this but it's just like tight in the armpits but other than that I actually like it but this this looks great on you Alana thanks so for somebody with this smoke yeah there's nothing you get this smaller chest I think this is a great option because the fabric is really nice yeah it's like that like optic white it's like a really white white which I kind of like so I like to mix that with like a cream or other like light colors yeah next I want to try this t-shirt from and other stories it's another crewneck all the shirts that we're trying on by the way are crewneck short sleeve shirts like nothing being actress all crew I think this one will be a cute one it looks a little more sheer than the by Carla one because it's a bit softer and not so stiff but I don't know let's see I like this already do you like this one yeah I like this one too so this is actually kind of similar to the Hanes by Carla it's not so thick so I think it is a little bit more flattering for people with a larger chest looks great also in a lot ah thank you it's very comfortable what do you guys think of this one it's so comfy and I like that it's not as snug fitting mm-hmm and but it's still a little thicker I feel like this is a good one if you want like the classic like higher crewneck shirt that's like it's a little bit men's II I like this seam right here it's like extremely flattering and the longer sleeves are cute because then you can do a little roll which I like to kind of make it like a little styled a little cooler I don't know I think it's nice when it's kind of like your regular but I do like when t-shirts have that longer sleeves to them and you see it I mean this seam right here is it's a flattering it looks really good I would you like a little front tuck I'm really like I think this is a really good one this is from and other stories I actually want you guys to try while we're on on it they make a linen tea which for me personally I sometimes find a linen to more flattering because it's a little bit more structure and it doesn't cling as much for somebody with like a larger chest so I think let's try this other and other stories okay come on out let's see this one this is also cute so this is the and other stories linen this is really cute you see what I mean by wearing when you have like a bigger see I like this better on Hannah then Alanna actually because I know when you have a no offense but when you have a bigger chest I think that the structure of linen or just like something about it is flattering have you ever tried on like a really like Jersey or like something like super stretchy white t it looks offense I wear it then it kind of clings unit sort of makes you look bigger than you are yeah I think this has like a nice texture and nice structure it gives the illusion of being sheer but it's actually not you can't really see your bra and what do you guys think they're going to eat but I like the way it looks and I think that it adds a little something with the fabric we can make some yeah I'll put it a little more safe yeah I also just like that it's very thin but it's not like when you look at it you know you can't see through it yet it's very thin like to the top yeah and it feels nice it's always nice there's something nice touching your skin yeah yeah okay I love that one next I want to try this is a favorite I feel like a lot of people on Instagram when I like posted a white t-shirt story a lot of people were talking about - ever lame t-shirts so I tried them and I feel like they're super good they're like 100% cotton and they feel really nice and just like a nice normal t-shirt this is the cotton Fox cut tea medium I heard somebody scream winter winter this is my favorite weight this it is so soft this looks so good on both of you it's so soft this is really really add and talked to and it's so it's called the boxy cut tee box cut - that works I feel like because it's it's not cropped necessarily but it's a little bit higher the sleeve is the perfect length on both of you it looks so good I was actually when I went into this video I was expecting like some t-shirts to look like way better on Milan or like way better on Hanah honestly this looks amazing on both of you so far this is my favorite yeah it's just like things simple casual if you feel super yes yeah so it feels super soft you cannot see your bra through at all it looks really smooth yeah so flattering and the neckline is the perk it's not too tight it's perfect yeah so comfortable it's so soft and it's been and I'm very much like I like them thin yeah and I love the way it looks oh yeah I think every white tee I own right now I hate the way it looks and I just never wear them for this I would like totally wear okay I love this one so far this is our number one right yeah okay I love this one the next one it's kind of similar this one's a bit thinner so we're gonna see how that goes this is um oh it has like a little bit of distressing which I don't love but let's try and look see how the fit is because sometimes you can forgive those kind of details oh it's a good fit yeah you know let's see it's a little tough what are you doing so this is the new favorite yeah this is a new one this one is similar it looks great I actually don't mind the distressed I feel like that's what I actually like about t-shirts when they have later yeah like when they have something different or like a little bit off about them this one looks great on both of you I think again what's good is like the boxiness and if it's a little bit cropped because some I mean I think we all like do like the front talk or like the full tuck around so when it's a little bit crop there's like a less fabric in there especially if you're rain like high-waisted jeans you don't want like that punchy yes so this you know this looks amazing yeah ever really short torso so then something cropped is very important for me yeah so this really works yeah I love this one okay now look at um I think maybe will not work as well this is from Zara and it's not cotton it's like that kind of stretchy jersey material let's see that's it guys okay not loving not loving it's a very sheer not loving for either it's so sheer and it's that clean but it's not like this sexy kind of cling it's like the so much background it's and it's stretchy this is not good and you for once can see both of your bras through yeah this is a no-go and it's very long oh yeah yeah even tuck cuz because there was a lot of fabric that's what I'm saying like sometimes there's too much fabric to talk yeah this is not a good one sorry Zara you lose so they both actually like the other Lane and the amo I put Hannah in Neverland which is sixteen dollars and Alana and amo which is $95 I think they're very very similar so if you're like kind of on the fence I would go ever lane the box cut T guys let's see cute they are very similar I think you guys are both sort of attracted to the same thing which is like a little bit cropped a longer sleep I mean they look so similar I actually I say so this one's 16 this one's 95 I prefer the color of that one that's just me you like the more distressed look this is cute it's like a little bit boyish it looks great I love this I really do like that one on you I think this is super flattering I love it I'm very hot we'd love to the maid well let's find that yes the middle one actually was great for both of you it was sheer but not too sure you weirdly couldn't see your bra through and it has like sheer burnout texture this was a great one for us oh the one that we didn't love sorry Carla but it's just a bit the idea is there because it's nice and thick and like super white and like very structured is that neck was a little bit too high it was just like a little too loose and but if you do like something like this and if you have like a smaller chest like Alana I would size up in this one as we liked the and other stories the classic tea this one was also really good on both of you I like this I think this was sort of a good compromise if you wanted something like that by Carla but just a little softer and a little bit less stiff yeah this was a big shock see but this looked great and the sleeve is really good yeah cuz it has like that nice shape that makes it look longer than it is like the drop shoulder and then we also tried on the linen one from and other stories which I like too I liked this one for you Hannah I like the linen like the texture of the linen yeah never tried a linen and I definitely want to start wearing them on I feel like the collar for this one is like flattering it's not too high but it still kind of gives the again like the men's II like cool relaxed boy style we did the ever layin which is I think this is like a great just classic white shirt you can like throw anything on over this and it's I'd rated this even with like a skirt yeah yeah tucked in perfect this is great it's a little bit crop so you have too much to tuck in the sleeve is a great length it's like that bright white which I also really love and then the AMA one which I also like to has like a little bit of distressing on the collar and on the sleeves but just wait it's a similar boxy I think these two are actually very very similar and again this one's a lot more expensive so if you're not sure I would try the eberlein when we didn't love so much is this one by Zara it was like just a little bit too clingy and it was SuperDuper long and the sleeves were also too short for this one so I think the winner like we said for Alanna is the amo and the winner for Hannah is the overlaying but we also love the and other stories this one for both of you yeah and I think the made bow okay and the meatball yeah we did really good this wasn't really this was really really really fun you guys I love this so help me and now I have a way to know actually where and like yes and now I know which one's better and which ones don't I love this this is so much fun thank you guys so much for doing this yeah are there bloopers [Music]", "LI3GpG3STDk": "hello everybody my name is Jennifer maker tonight we are talking about infusible inks and what kinds of t-shirts so what kind of fiber content and what colors we can put them on I'm the great maker show and tell so ever since crickets and fusible links came out folks have been asking me what we can put them at now Cricut has a lot of official blanks they have t-shirts and they have tote bags and they have coasters but what if you are a different size than the t-shirts that are available because this the sizes I believe are small to 2x so what if you're a larger size or what if you like a different style of t-shirt but what if you want a different color or a whole lot of different things what if we don't want 95% polyester and you want in 5% spandex which is what the Cricut shirts are what if you need a little bit more cotton content right so tonight we are going to look at over 15 it's actually 19 different t-shirts that I have already tested and already washed so we're going to look at them we're going to look at them in some cases we're gonna be able to see what they look like before they're washed but we'll be able to compare what they look like after they've been washed so you can see how they held up and how they look in the first place and everything like that now if you have questions please feel free to shut your question now and I will do my best to answer it my team is here thank you guys so much for being here and we'll help out with questions to the best of their ability and I actually have a blog post that has links to the t-shirts that I found on Amazon and actually it's a list of all the shirts that we're testing tonight it's over on my blog at jennifermcguireink.com I tested and then show you what they look like before we wash them and after we wash them so let's head on over to my workspace and I can explain what I have done for you and also I can love them to check the screen and look for questions as well all right so let's head on over there and take a look okay so here is my stack of white t-shirts there's quite a few of them here they've all I have already put them put the image on I have used the exact same image and every single one so we can compare and look at the color transfer and everything I picked this rainbow transfer sheet that comes in this is the Shaylee infusible ink box so it's this one right here and I put this wing tart on every single one of these 19 shirts to show you and so this one here at the top this is the cricket shirt this is the one that is sold at Michael stores right now exclusively it's at Michael's stores and this is the one that Cricut guarantees that they're a fusible links will work on but as you can see there's a lot more shirts here that I tested with so we're gonna find out what else works especially in terms of the fiber content for these because these are all white which is like really the perfect color to use in fusible links on because in fusible links are not like vinyl where it just sits right on top of the surface it is instead an ink it's a kind of sublimation ink that actually infuses into the surface of the t-shirt so there's nothing here it just feels like t-shirt so it's really very awesome if you're not familiar with in fusible ink technology I have lots of videos I have an ultimate guide to it we did we've done several play tests on how this works in fact here's the quick little preview of me creating all 19 of these t-shirts using my Cricut ez press 2 and infusible ink now this is sped up a lot as you can imagine but you can see here how I am putting the in fusible ink transfer which is the heart with the wings that I created on my Cricut onto my t-shirt know that I'm using the paper underneath to protect my mat as well as two sheets to put your paper on top of my shirt to protect from scorching and that thing it's also important to note that I am preheating each of these shirts before I put my design at I am using crickets instructions so we are heating me my ez press is at three hundred and eighty five degrees Fahrenheit and I'm doing it pressing for forty seconds but do exactly what the Cricut ez press guide tells us to do now of course it doesn't know that I'm using all these different kinds of shirts so I'm simply following the same directions for all of the shirts so all the shirts are three hundred eighty five degrees for 40 seconds I also want to note that normally you want to wait before you remove at the transfer for the shirt you want to wait till it cools down I edited this video so you weren't just watching nothing while it I wait for it to cool down so it's just important again if you're not familiar with how to use infeasible ink please check out my tutorials I had a great tutorial on how to do t-shirts that shows you step-by-step exactly what to do and then putting that link for you right here on the screen so you can head on over there and check it out now let's look at each t-shirt that I tested with Cricut infeasible ink up close this is the cricut shirts this is what we're gonna compare everything to so this is the one that guaranteed that cricut guarantees will work with it's in fusible ink transfer sheets and markers okay so let's compare how this looks to the what it looks like before it was washed so we move that over there we go okay so here we go on the left you can see the pre-washed version and on the right you can see it washed and you can see it looks identical there's no difference at all okay next shirt so this is the one that hopefully everything will look as good as this this is I mean this is our goal it's not going to happen guys but this is what we would like okay now remember infusible ink really needs polyester or polymer to bind to and that's why it's so important what our shirt content is all right so here is 100% poly sir this is what look like before we washed it and this is what looks like after it looks the same to me and this is a shirt that I found on Amazon it is kind of feels like an athletic shirt it's sort of shiny rather than being soft right but it takes the infusible ink really really well and there's a link to that if you want to find this shirt there's a link to this in my blog and then my blog post okay so next one so this is the 92 percent polyester 8% spandex still looks the same to me 92% polyester is really really a high current polyester so this looks good so again the one on the left is the pre-wash and this one is after it's been washed okay so this looks great this shirt is a No Boundaries shirt and I got it from Walmart for I don't know like five bucks or something very inexpensive okay next shirt is 90% polyester so and this one didn't quite like something happens I've seen this happen once in a while and I haven't figured out what it is it's possible that it's just not a good shirt to start with I don't know so this is a Tara and Skye's shirt that I also found at Walmart 90% polyester 10% spandex and it's the color looks the same to me as I did before I washed it I don't see any difference in color just we have this kind of faded spot here again I don't know if it's because of the quality of the shirt which is certainly possible or if it's just a user error alright next shirt so this is an eighty percent polyester twenty percent cotton and now I think that we can see just a tiny little bit of fading maybe maybe I'm just seeing things they actually look really similar to me so this is a Fruit of the Loom shirt and it came like a pack for it was really affordable I got this on Amazon I believe and I had the link to this one in my blog post and but it looks really now the only thing that I see like looking at it with my naked eye which you guys might not be able to see like I I don't know it does look a little bit so tell me a bit faded you can see the fibers of the cotton kind of peeking through but it's not bad or anything it's it's not bad alright next shirt is a 65% polyester 30 percent cotton George brand and this comes from Walmart and I think it looks really similar to the one that we just saw just a little bit of fading not so vibrant and let's just to compare it let's get out the cricket one over here so you can see so this here is the cricket one you see that you see how it is a little bit more vibrant know if you see that right it's definitely the green and the yellow they're all popping just a little bit more but that bad and these shirts are really inexpensive now I want to note that the Georgia actually has two different polyester cotton blends one has a lot of polyester and one has a lot of Cotton's so you'll want to check the label and don't just assume if you go to Walmart looking for George that you got the right one okay so this is the 65 polyester 30 percent cotton alright so this here is now I can you guys can definitely see a difference here right so this is the 40% polyester 60% cotton George brands this is also from Walmart and there these are like based I found them really close to each other and they're like in the men's section by the way I didn't really find any of these in the women's section but but I think this is a v-neck yeah this is a v-neck so I mean it still looks like a nice shirt but you can see that fading here right you can see that that it's just sort of more washed out right now note that how it looked when you first did it and how it looks now right so thing is is that even though it looks really good when you first make it if you're putting it on something that isn't able where the inks not able to bind with it you're gonna get this fading okay maybe you're okay with that but this is after one wash I don't know how it's going to look in Ted and washes or 50 washes it could get really light okay so keep that in mind and let's look at the last one which is 100% cotton so this is a huge difference I mean this is like pastel now so this is a hundred percent cotton now on the Left we can see that it came and faded it started to faded right which it kind of looks nice it has a like a retro look right it's totally cool but this is after one wash okay this is like super pastel now this is almost like something a baby might wear but the thing is is that after I feel really confident that after a few washes we're barely gonna be able to say this it's just gonna look like a mistake at that point so 100% cotton is not going to be a good choice to use with an fusible ink even though it might look okay when you first put it on after washing it it's just going to be a disappointment I really recommend that you pay attention to your polyester cap the higher you go up the more vibrant it gets and the longer it's going to last when you wash it right I mean look these look really awesome I mean this one I have no okay it's amazing I mean look at how that look that good in fact let's just compare this one to the cotton I mean look at the difference here guys that is a huge difference this is they're both have been washed exactly the same they were washed together so big big difference the more polyester you have the better it's going to look so hopefully that helps you guys and of course you can see that there's a lot of different shirts because the thing is is that I know that the cricket shirts aren't going to work for everybody they don't come in all the sizes they don't even have they don't even have sizes for like kids right now they just have the small through 2x in the women's and the men's and at my Michaels I couldn't even find it to X's so if you can find them I mean I think these shirts are the cricket shirts are really really amazing because they're stupid they don't even feel like polyester this one feels like pilot this one here this would definitely feels like polyester this their cricket shirts don't they're very soft there's something about the way that they're woven and the type of fibers that they're using it's making a difference so if the cricket shirt is available in your size and style get that and if it's not then use one of these alternatives okay alright so do you guys have any questions about these various white shirts before I switch over to the colored shirts because I did all of those and I would love it to show you those ginger says can we use 100% polyester yes totally this is 100% polyester this is right here it looks amazing it looks great it will work I believe it's going to work just as well as the cricket shirts too and really add just a little bit looks amazing it's very vibrant Peggy says I have a 100% polyester sheet that's too big for my bed I'm gonna have fun playing and you know something Peggy that's a great idea I thought about going to the fabric store and just getting a bunch of fabric in different sizes to test but I wanted to be able to show you actual t-shirts that you could purchase like whatever store because I know that you guys are looking for t-shirts alright so I think that OH Alex asks where is a hundred percent polyester shirt from this comes from Amazon this is the Hanes cool dry and this is a woman's shirt but they have them in this woman's v-neck so it's really nice fitted shirt but they also have them in men's and stuff I really like this this I've gotten this brand several times it is polyester it's like it has very very smooth rather than soft finish but hey maybe that's okay with you okay cool all right let's move on to the colored shirts here is the stack of colored shirts I got a whole bunch of colors now you'll note that they're mostly pastel because this is eight it's not vinyl it's ink and it's transparent ink it's not going to look good on like a navy blue shirt and we're gonna talk about that later don't worry it's going to look if you're gonna put it on to a colored shirt because you don't like white or whatever it's gonna look best on these light pastel colors okay otherwise it's just not going to be visible because it's transparent ink alright so we're gonna start with them 100% polyester shirt this is a 100% polyester shirt it's the same cool dry Hanes shirt that I showed you in the white one okay I got this from Amazon exact same shirt v-neck women's shirt can you see this white outline here this is where my piece of transfer me see if I have one that can show you so this is the fusible link transfer so you know it was on here like this so see the marking here so I've seen this show up on a number of people's shirts that they posted and I don't know why it does but it's there even after we washed it so you need to watch for this because maybe you're okay with this maybe you're not okay with this right but the color looks pretty good you can see how the blue basically is there's like no blue because it's not a blue shirt everything that's significant and also because this is transparent ink a lot of the colors are changing from what we would see and white to you know like this is supposed to be yellow but it looks green right so that's something to take into account right this should be pink and it looks like it's purple right but it transferred pretty well and it washed really well okay so this one has that box around it all right this one oh my gosh I really dislike this shirt this shirt came from Walmart and it's a very vibrant color don't wouldn't you say so I did this let's see if I can even show you I can and you know when we do in fusible ink we need to cut me to cover our mats so that the in fusible ink itself does not bleed through onto our pressing mats well look what this lovely shirt did it was it's so vibrant I washed these by the way it was so vibrant that it transferred its own ink to my pressing pad and now I will forever have to be careful this yeah so this one this is not sure that I'm gonna recommend to anybody but I found it at Walmart and it's 92 percent polyester 8% spandex and it's got this annoying box around it again from the transfer sheet I don't know what this is cause fraud by but I personally don't like it I don't like the way it looks at all so I would say this is a no-go yes yes Alex they were all pre-washed okay so here is the 80 percent polyester 20 percent cotton Athletics work shirt I found this at Walmart it was in the clearance section I don't even know if they still saw this but whatever it's like actually a tank top or a racerback shirt or something so I can't really see a white box around this one of course it's got a different texture to it actually came out really well you know it doesn't look like it faded very much maybe just the tiniest bit but not much it's pretty good and the colors are vibrant and amazingly the pink still transferred to this one I guess it was light enough I know no it's interesting but this one was actually pretty good so this one came from Walmart again so Rhonda says maybe the design can be cut closer to get rid of that scare get rid of the square and apply heat and use it beautiful heat tape yeah I think that's a possibility you would have to cut all the way through or trim around it and that might be a lot of work but here's the thing is that you'll notice that on other shirts you can't see it so it's something about I'm thinking it's something about the way this shirt is colored but I don't know for sure just taking a wild guess here this here is 65% polyester 35% cotton this is the same George brand that I showed you in the white shirts which i think is actually pretty a pretty good I think he's pretty they're really inexpensive and I don't know I think four or five dollars per shirt and they come in a lot of different sizes a lot of different sizes and different colors so I like this this has a tiny bit of fading but it's it looks really good to me still so I think this is a winner and I actually got a bunch of these so we could look at how the color transferred to these so that's the purple one and I'll slide these over see we can compare this is a blue one same exact shirt just different color so again it looks a lot better on this purple than it does on the blue the blue is definitely changing the transparent ink in a different way and that's significant if you are you know what color you're trying to decide I actually this isn't pink this is purple I don't know what color I said this is purple just that's clear and this is like a light blue the George brand is from Walmart and again it's important to note that they come in different they have some that have more polyester and some that have more cotton you want the ones with more polyester it really is going to make a difference here is another one and this is a it's kind of a orange a pink color I guess salmon we would call it call that and it looks you know I can see fading here it might be hard to see in the camera I'm looking at it from a different angle and I can kind of see it like at a 45 degree angle so I could see the fibers of the cotton shirt better still looks really good though I think that looks really good I think this is actually a good shirt so after testing it what six times I think I tested it six times okay so here so this here is a totally different shirt this is a Gildan shirt that I found I believe at Michaels maybe it was at Joanne's it was at one of the craft stores and it's 50% polyester and 50% cotton and it's blue so the design didn't transfer as well as it might have done in a lighter color a more Pinker color but it did transfer pretty well hard to say how long and I'll contain a hold up in the wash but it looks pretty good right now all right so here is the George brand that is less cotton less re less polyester and more cotton and while this looks this design it looks pretty good because this is such a light color it's pretty faded I don't know if I have one I could compare we can compare it to this pink one over here set these aside so here is this is a 80% cotton sorry 80% polyester and this one here is the 40% polyester and you can see that this is quite a bit more vibrant than this right so you know I mean but maybe you're ok with it maybe you're ok wearing your shirt for a few times and it's not that big of a deal maybe it's a special occasion shirt right I mean there's always possibilities here nothing is ever really you know if you really really like cotton more you know just wear your shirt a little less or you use it as a save it so this is I think this is actually still pretty I think it's gonna fade a lot more as you wash it though just so you know all right and let's look at 100% cotton that's been washed it looked a little better when we put it put it out initially this is what it looks like when it's been washed you can't even see the color at this point it's just kind of like some green and some brownish colors and I think that if we wash this like five five more times I bet it would be just barely a shadow something that was here once ginger says a solid and fusible ink would probably look good on the Gildan blue shirt you know so they're all they all of the in fusible links they're all transparent so if we had used purple it would look like this right if we had used green it would look like this so you can't this is actually sorry this is pink that purple sorry right so this is orange this is pink this is like red this is purple here and this is blue so you know I mean it's still going to take on the color underneath it so remember our color wheel and when we mix colors we're going to get these we're going to get a different color than what you expect when you put it onto something that's got the base color is this dark so keep that in mind okay alright so let's see yes so someone mentioned the black shirt so we're gonna talk about that because of course we tested a black shirt guys I said I would here is our black shirt mm-hmm and yes I put in fusible in cactus when I move this so this is got the design let's see if we can see this at all it has been washed you can kind of see right yeah the guys probably can't see that but I can kind of see a rectangle there gosh it's not even focusing it's like just black let's put this back on and give it something to focus on there truly is feasible in care we show you about where it went it's probably right about I'm gonna match it up to this rectangle it looks like it was right about here okay this is where I put it the thing is though infeasible and gets transparent so what happens when you put transparent anything I'm black we get this we get nothing this is what it looks like just don't even bother don't do this because it's a waste of your infusible ink it's not it's there literally is infeasible in canvas but because it's transparent you cannot see it okay but if anyone saw my preview image then you saw that I did have something on a black shirt okay and by the way this if you're curious this is a George shirt with 40% polyester okay alright so let's flip this shirt over so I can show you now I tried some different things first off I tried white flocking vinyl that I got it's like a so you can find that yes here it is I tried Caeser strip flock Pro HTV just I don't know just for the heck of it just see what would happen and I put the white on first and then after the white was away I applied it normally but you would normally apply heat transfer and then over the top of the white I put my infusible ink and as you can see it did indeed transfer right it's not go in the dark now but it did transfer and this has been washed it's still there guys it is still there so that was my first test to see if we get this in fusible ink on a black shirt now you might be wondering why on earth would anybody care just use vinyl and I agree you probably just wanted you to find out but if you just love the use the feeding patterns you just really want to put this on a shirt of your choice then these are our options so this is using the strip flock Pro HDTV that I found this at Michael's by the way I think there's actually a better product I think it's called sub flock and I think it's actually better at absorbing the sublimation ink so I haven't I don't have my hands on it yet but I have heard about it okay so this is um flocking HDTV but then Miranda who is my Miranda is my customer service angel she said that she saw i'm youtube that people were using glitter a heat transfer vinyl so i got some of that and this is what happened so this is white glitter heat transfer vinyl Julie says that I spray that know that this this is heat transfer vinyl this is vinyl so is this these are both vinyl and they come white like this so here is the white glitter and here is the the flock the flocking is like super like soft stuff right from like this seven days right you know the wallpaper that kind of [ __ ] so this started as white glitter heat transfer and I cut out my heart in the same mean of the same heart and I put it on to the black shirt in the normal way that you put on heat transfer nothing special and then I took my my infusible ink transfer and I put it right on top of the white glitter heat transfer and I did I follow the normal directions for pressing it so I believe I did this at 385 degrees for 40 seconds which is what I did all of these shirts at by the way and this is what I got and doesn't this look amazing so this has been washed and it still looks to me as good as it did when I put it on it did not fade it on this one faded this one did not fade this one looks really really good I think that this white so if you really just really want to put invisible eight onto a black or navy blue or a dark purple shirt then this is what you should do put some white glitter heat transfer vinyl and by the way this is the cricket brand this is um we just got bought this down at our Joanne's that's five minutes from a house I actually said Greg a prank I need some white glitter heat transfer vinyl he's like okay he did it for me thank you Greg and then I put this on here and it worked so this is not my original idea I think that this existed long before we had infeasible ink because I bleach I went and looked it up on YouTube and people have been putting doing this for sublimation ink for years okay so this is not I'm not taking credit for this idea but thank you Miranda for letting me know about this so yeah so if you really want to use a dark shirt Becky says did the glitter show through yeah you can tell it's very pretty actually let me show you I said we can get this closer and then light here can you guys see the glitter see isn't that pretty I think it's really pretty is it really the glitter actually makes the colors pop a little bit more so and someone had concerns that it would wash right out but didn't for me the flocking did but not this this looks great so there we go alright so I'm gonna switch back over to me and I'm gonna see if you guys have questions okay alright awesome so let's see so Stephanie says I just joined this live stream and I've tried the infusible in kind of mint green shirt and it came out beautiful awesome I'm super glad to hear that I've been seeing a lot of people using pastel shirts that looks great remember the key is the higher the polyester count the better is going to look and one thing I want to note as we move down from into the higher cotton shirts I noticed more scorching going on the cotton does not like that super high temperatures at the at the links that we need to go to for in fusible ink and when I did the 100% cotton shirt I saw weird brown marks show up on my shirt and I want to see if they came out in the wash okay so this is a hundred percent cotton shirt you know doesn't really I don't really see looks like a lot of it might have washed out it doesn't look too maybe just a little bit I can kind of see on the sides just a tiny little bit if I wasn't looking for this I wouldn't be able to see any scorching so it actually would have the discoloration did come out when we washed it that's good so if you're seeing discoloration in your cotton shirts which probably shouldn't be using guys but if you want to use them anyways try washing them to see if you can get that out just keep that in mind so if it scorches it's too cotton just doesn't like it that hot for that lot Lutie says do you think it would work better on cotton with the glitter first yep yep if you really want to use have a hundred percent cotton shirt in but you really want a fusible ink because you love those patterns put that white glitter HTV on the shirt and then put your fusible link transfer on it one tip I have for that is I noticed that as we heat the fusible entry four sheets they shrink just a little bit so if you tape it down in the exact spot you want it to go your shirt kind of been shrinks along with it instead of it shrinking without the shirt and then it looks at mal matches up better and it stays in position better so definitely use the cricket heat transfer tape when you are putting the in fusible ink transfers on top of the white glitter htb yes I washed all of these shirts first because we don't want to worry about whether we have sizing in them or anything like that just it's so they're you know there's kind of like differing opinions about whether you should wash them first cricket by the way doesn't say that we need to wash these first for infusible ink so don't think that matters but you know it helps with like shrinking and stuff the only time that you might not want to wash a shirt forces if you're playing to sell it because it never looks new after you washed it right so instead of get ones that are pre sized you know so they're already black preshrunk and then but don't wash them and then you know it looks better that's what I hear at least I don't sell my shirts or anything like that necie says is there an easy way to weed the invisible ink I think it's actually really easy to weed I did all of these hearts and there's like Oh a lot of them superfast if you use the bend and crack method you know so you're just kind of bending it and making sure all the edges are lifting up it actually comes off really easily and if you watched my other videos you can see me actually weeding the the transfer sheets and how it's different right it's different than how we weed vinyl and I like it a lot better Vicky says does the glitter after the imputable ink feel like vinyl nope it feels like glitter it feels like um I mean just touch it again it feels you know so you know the way glitter feels it's got almost like a kind of like sandpaper II feel because it's got all the little glitter parts embedded in it that is what it feels like Janet says what time and temperature did you use for these shirts I used that I used crickets easy press heat guide for all of four bases you know I used it for cricket shirts so only when it gives me a time for so I use the exact same time and temperature for all of them which was three hundred eighty five degrees am i easy press two for forty seconds you could also have done your easy press one at what would it be three hundred and sixty degrees because it's the highest it goes up so probably a little longer I just don't happen to know what that is but Cricut has an excellent heat press guide that you would just use to determine what that would be thank you Joe I'm really happy that you like my testing I'm checking for more questions to see if you guys have any more questions before I wrap up tonight this is a great time to throw them out there for us Lori says what do you do with a different heat settings for vinyl and then infuse oblique so I simply followed the heat transfer settings for vinyl and once it was in place I let it cool a little bit so you know it was more you know wasn't like still you know in fact you have to wait until the glitter is cool to even pull off the backing anyways and when I put I didn't had no issues it worked I simply used the same settings for them fusible ink that I use for all the other shirts when I put it on top of the glitter so I didn't even worry about it because it was a test right it was okay to try it and if it didn't work then oh well we just try it again so but it worked so I used the normal settings for glitter heat transfer vinyl and then I use the normal settings for infeasible ink on top of that white glitter Megan says do we use the butcher paper so I made a lot of t-shirts I did not use two sheets of butcher paper for brand new sheets of butcher paper for each of these shirts so I found that my butcher paper wasn't transferring nothing was getting transferred to it I was having no issues and I I think I only ended up using like four sheets for all of these shirts so I reused it I always checked it to make sure that I didn't see any anything being transferred to it that would then transfer to one of my new shirts but it didn't so it was fine Ginetta says I was hoping it would test depends my experience there's no difference between how the pens and a transfer sheets go on to materials if you are curious about how the pens I have a whole video on that right so you can just watch that video but I've seen no difference and how they transfer they transfer the same it's the same ink it's just ones coming out of the pen and ones on a transfer sheet but it looks the same once we transfer it it acts we transfer it the same way it looks the same so it wasn't necessary to do all of the testing Gina asked if the white transfer the white glitter was stiff like final yes it is because it's white it's white but it's white glitter vinyl that's there the white cleared of metal doesn't go away so it has that same it's not super stiff but there's definitely something there it's not like the awesomeness that is in fusible ink where it's totally weightless right you still it feels like vinyl with that's been colored that's basically what while we're doing here all right let me just get that at the bottom let's see someone mentioned parchment paper no do not use parchment paper parchment paper has a coating on it what your paper does not if you use parchment paper or wax paper you can transfer that coating to your shirt I have seen it done and it looks bad don't do it guys don't waste your shirts use butcher paper you can get it on Amazon very inexpensively I have a giant roll of it let me show ya I will put a menu remember my team can put the link this is my big roll of butcher paper it's gonna last a really really long time it was really inexpensive you can get it pretty sure her people say they got theirs at Walmart or their local grocery store but you want white butcher paper don't substitute in this case it's going to be a disappointment it's not freezer paper either guys it's not freezer paper put your paper freezer paper has a coating at it in fact the most famous one has a plastic coating on it you do not want to transfer that to your shirt what's your paper it doesn't have the coating you want that yesthank right ginger says put your paper parchment paper and freezer paper are all different it's important that you use the right one because that coating will transfer I've seen it happen okay I think I have gotten everyone's questions just double-checking Ossie says can you use a heat press yes you can I just don't have one so I use my easy press so we use an easy press Mary says where would I find the video about the Pens well I'll tell you what if you go to my youtube channel at youtube.com slash C / Jennifer maker all of my videos are there tons of them and that's where you'll find my video about the Pens as well as my video about that fusible link tote bag and the infeasibility t-shirt and infusible inks in general like I have I think I have 5 or 6 videos on a fusible links at this point yep I mean that's I think I got them all so I want to remind everybody that we're still having our summer maker giveaway so we

dry low no dryer sheets no bleach and no fabric softener and that's what we did so Mal detergent right yes Gregg says mild detergent okay I think that's it thank you everybody for being here tonight

quarantine time I think people are their wardrobes have become a bit of a mess I mean you're basically wearing loungewear or some sort of like t-shirt and sweatpants maybe through the entire day if you're working from home and I know a lot of you guys are working from home and so I have this favorite brand or this favorite set of loungewear and I just want to share that with you guys today but we're talking about reigning champ I'm not sure if you can see the logo here reigning champ so out of the reigning champ stuff I'm a huge fan of what we're talking about today and that is the t-shirt I've been trying to find the perfect balance of like this high quality garment but also very comfortable and something that I can wear during the core team during any time where I'm just like lounging around at home and reigning champ has been that brand so as you can see I have a white t-shirt on right now a white t-shirt is a complete and utter essential in any wardrobe whether you're woman man old young it doesn't matter you need a white t-shirt so I bought a white t-shirt like this I would say black is the same way getting a black t-shirt like this as well is very very important for your wardrobe but I also even have a couple other colors so this is a navy I have an interesting story about this particular t-shirt in a second and I also have the gray so man this is the four t-shirt like this is gonna last me you know if you're not taking a shower every day this might last you a whole week potentially you know so what are you looking for in some loungewear so obviously you want it to be comfortable I think you want the quality of the material to be high because you're gonna be washing this quite often you might work out in them you might sweat like crazy in them it doesn't matter you need to be able to wash them over and over and over again and that's harsh on the fabrics the higher the quality of the fabric is the easier it's gonna be able to kind of withstand that and stay alive for a long period of time on to the story that I was trying to explain so this is the Navy shirt from writing channel this is a you know something that I've had actually for over a year and and I think it still looks great I mean there's not really there's no holes there's no stretching there's no it looks like a shirt you can buy off to the rack today I actually got in an accident where I was hit by a car while running so it's a long story it was crazy like I was in shock and everything at that but I did end up getting like you might be able to see here like a bunch of scars on my arm but you'll notice that the scar ends like in a line right here I don't know if you can see that right there but that's because I was wearing this t-shirt and it's so interesting to me hey that this t-shirt basically survived a car crash and this left arm is where that that kind of like where it would have like scarred me here but and I imagine the t-shirt would be completely wrecked after that but it's fine I don't see a single rip or tear or anything like that so I don't know if that's the ultimate test like you shouldn't you know don't go get hit by a car just to see how good your t-shirt is it just gives you an indication that like this these things are strong like they can actually the the fabric is good enough that you can put it through the wash of bazillion times and you're just fine now if that's the case though that means that you have to spend the extra coin generally here's the brutal truth these t-shirts MSRP retail are like 40 or 50 dollars like that's a lot for a t-shirt you actually can go to Nordstrom Rack or their sales that happen every year I would wait for one of those sales and they drop the price of these to like somewhere like $30 so my recommendation would be to wait a little bit and then get t-shirt in one of those sales again I'd point that Nordstrom Rack is one of those places to get it I would also recommend that you get the main colors now you know you've seen in my stack here I have black navy gray white I mean that's about is that's about as universal unit you can wear those with pretty much any outfit whether you're indoors and in a quarantine in front of webb-kim or you're you know when we've got back out there you're like out and about and you just have a t-shirt and a jacket or something like those colors will work with pretty much anything it is gonna be more expensive than other brands but your most of that money is going towards the quality and the design and not so much the brand yet I think they haven't quite gotten to that point yet and so for me like these have outlived the the reigning champ stuff has outlived Nike stuff for me neatest stuff for me you know gap and then or public j.crew like that's that's the sort of stuff I used to have and I think this is kind of the next step and I don't regret taking that next step during this time I hope everyone enjoys their loungewear cuz they super comfortable yet super fashionable and yeah so there it is reigning champ is one of my favorite things I'm mark Kwok I'll see you the next one [Music]", "fWfdzXfZ5uI": "what's up y'all I'm Madison beam and welcome to another video if you love budget style and beauty be sure to hit that subscribe button because I make content like this all the time but in today's video we're having a little faceoff of who makes the best budget white t-shirt as you guys may have noticed in my last several your girl has been scooping up a lot of white t-shirts and that's because it really is the go-to basic of the season a lot of publications were reporting that it was supposed to be the year at the tank top that's we're seeing on all the spring runway shows but like I've said in other videos that all changed when Meghan Margo was seen on one zoom meeting wearing a white t-shirt so now it's absolutely everywhere we've been seeing celebrities even Quarantine styling white t-shirts different ways so I wanted to see for the money from brands like Target Walmart hmm and more who made the best budget white teeth I spent my coin so you guys don't have to as always I will link everything in the description box and for size reference in this video I'm between 5 2 and 5 3 I'm very short I weigh around one hundred and forty five pounds and I'm typically a dress size 6 I'll share my sizes as we go because it does vary from brand to brand so now let's go ahead and hop in the video so when I was planning for this video I really thought that I was gonna choose one favorite but as I discovered ordering a bunch of white t-shirts and different styles some are better for different outfits so instead I'm gonna break this down more by category and then at the end I'll share with you guys my favorites out of everything so starting with the top that I have on this cropped pocket boyfriend tee this is from Walmart and it's around $8 but you could normally catch on rollback for even cheaper than that I did get my in a size medium but I could have definitely gone with a small this shirt is 100% cotton as well and I am so obsessed with this style if you guys have seen my last Walmart haul you know that I went kind of crazy and I bought this literally in every color that I could find it first of all of the boxy oversize style are what's really popular for 2020 I also find this to be very flattering on my body type because it is on the more cropped side and you can still see my waist especially if I do decide to do like a little front tuck the sleeve also hits me lower which I find extremely flattering it does have a drop sleeve some of these tees as you're gonna see don't hit me necessarily in the best spot for my arms but this one really does and it's the main reason why I absolutely love this style it does also of course have the pocket another pocket white team that I have is from Target and if you're more into feminine styles this is definitely the one that I would go with it does taper in a little more at the waist and it does have a scoop on the bottom and set up just the straight across crop and the sleeves do cuff up you can't undo this by the way it is how the shirt actually comes but I do like that this fabric is a little different from any of the other shirts in this video and that's because it's 50% linen so it does give it a little bit more texture than any of the other shirts the other 50% is polyester by the way and I did get this in a size small and it's around 16 dollars out of all the white t-shirts in the video this is really the one to me that screamed summer so I definitely like that about it it is on the more see-through side so I would expect to wear a white or nude bra or to wear a cami underneath it honestly out of all of these even a thicker ones I would still expect to wear a white or new bra but especially this one is more see-through and I do honestly grab for it often like I said if you're a more into feminine styles this is the one that I would go with and my last pocket tee I did order from Amazon and it's the jockey brand I bought in the medium and it was $13 to be honest I'm pretty disappointed in this shirt I was hoping to have it be comparable to the shirt that I have on but first of all it does fit very small I would definitely size up in this if I had to do it again also it has the word jockey across the pocket which it did not show on it was on this show that this was a completely white pocket now they don't even sell this shirt at all so I'm not even sure I can return this but I'm a try and it's not that it's the world's most terrible quality white t-shirt but I personally just don't really want to walk around in a jockey on the pocket Amazons brand daily ritual has a cropped pocket tee that I would recommend instead of this jockey one the website listed as a cotton in Modell's blend which is my absolute favorite that's what gives it that nice stretch and it just feels really smooth but I definitely would skip this so another Amazon white tee is this one and it was $60 and I did get this in a size large and yes I said large because this is a pretty small shirt it's 65% polyester 30% cotton and 5% spandex I love fabrics that either have spandex in them or they have a spandex feel it's super comfortable and I really love that the tied detail is already built in on this one I normally have to tie up my t-shirt so I like that this one already came with that with that being said I do feel like this is a really small I'd also wear it with high-waisted jeans or even some high waisted leggings but to do it again I would size up I do really like it though and they have this in a ton of different colors in different patterns in this same style so I'm definitely gonna order more of them but I'm personally gonna go with an extra large so next onto just the plain scoop neck tee that's what I did get from Amazon Amazon does sell them in a two-pack so I did go with this oatmeal color and you can get two white ones though and I know this is a video about white tee shirts but I absolutely love it in this oatmeal color as well and I did get both of these in a size small because I read their reviews that this is supposed to be a lot more fitted and more snug so that's just what I went with but if you don't want to just tie it just size one up although I do really like this fit both of them are a cotton and Modell blend and that's what gives the fabric comes done so much stretch and honestly you guys be sure to feel like butter and I really do love these shirts with that being said I understand that this is sleeve in particular hits my arm at the widest part and it's not necessarily the most flattering sleeve it also very see-through so I know I'll have to wear a lighter bra with this but these are still some of my favorite shirts in the whole video next I have the basic white scoop neck from H&M and I got this one in a size medium it's also 100% cotton I really love this shirt and it was only $4.99 you guys this one isn't as tight so even though the sleep still hits me at the widest part like the last one it's not as obvious as the Amazon one and overall it's a lot more loose fitting of a shirt I think both of these are fantastic options actually so it really just depends if you're wanting a tight scoop neck shirt or if you just want something that's a bit looser and overall has a more casual look okay onto v-necks although I find v-necks to probably be the most flattering neckline myself I really didn't think I would love them as much as I liked all of these options so my first one is from Old Navy and I got it in a size medium it's 95% rayon and 5% spandex so that does make the fabric very yummy and I don't even know what other word to use besides Yummie I'm absolutely obsessed with this white t-shirt it does have a lot of stretch and it is pretty big on me so to do it again I would size down in this and although it does have shorter sleeves because it is looser I find it to be more flattering than some of the other cap sleeves and the fabric is a lot thicker on this one too so my next Phoenix is from Walmart and it's the time and true brand and this was only five dollars you guys and I did size up and get this in a large so I could tie it up but these shirts do run true to size so keep that in mind it's 60% cotton and 40% polyester and you guys this really is the shirt that started all for me this is the first white shirt that I bought this season and I do really like it it's very inexpensive if you're looking for just a plain white v-neck this one probably is your best option and now comparing it to targets version I bought this one in the men's section it's the Goodfellow brand and I got it in a size medium and it's also only five dollars I did get it from the men's section because I just couldn't find anything comparable to this in the women's section this shirt is also 60% cotton and 40% polyester a target one because it's from the man section might be like a centimeter longer so I think my favorite still is the white boyfriend pocket tee that I have on I feel like this is just gonna look good on absolutely everyone plus it really is on trend and it's very inexpensive for scoop-neck tees I'm probably gonna have to give that today H&M one just because it is a little looser that I feel like it looks slightly more flattering on me the name is on a central one but just know that I do absolutely love this one and I know I'm gonna wear it often and for v-necks y'all gonna have to hands down give this one to Old Navy one it's just a much higher quality shirt that's it for today's video please comment below which white t-shirt was your favorite I would love to hear what

to go ahead and make me a a shirt little halloween shirt or whatnot and uh i wanted to do sublimation but i wanted to do it on black cotton so but today what i'm going to try to execute is the cotton subs box uh tack down method i believe that's what it's called uh shout out to techbot customs and er thing like that i checked out his video you know i mean so it's a little different way to do the uh cotton sub so you want to see that sit back throw your seat belt and hold on to the wrap baby and we'll be right back but first go ahead and like comment subscribe for your girl yeah i'm gonna get right back with you y'all [Music] i believe that's a good little city let me turn off some light in here get it nice and bright all right that's good right yeah so check me out y'all real quick like i

say that on tremendous because you can use them yes you come all right um boom so what you want to do we're going to spray this paper right here this paper right here i'm going to spray with this right here you with me you're picking up what i'm throwing down baby but yeah i like miss y'all nothing heavy and then what you want to do i'm gonna get i got this box of uh trash under here a box is a better to have like when you're doing vinyl and something make it use a bunch of paper and carry your sheets and it's just better but anyway so over here spray over my box don't be too close to it though like miss y'all don't snap do not snap do you hear me all right all right i think i'm good all right i might hold these you don't understand the first time i did this um because i have tried it i messed up because i guess i missed it and like globs of the adhesive came out but you want to put this smooth side down now this part you got to be really patient with you because it's tacky so it's going to want to grab it so he's got to be quick with it once you get it up there you just kind of smooth that baby out you don't smoke but you just want to make sure it's flat y'all get all your

years i mean right now all right this isn't even this is looking more promising than i did the first time all right so once you got that smoothed on there like that got this move great yeah what they call i believe is the guillotine guillotine cutter also with his head yeah but um then you just cut your touch your image straight image boom i come down a few more times with the cotton so just to make sure i got any straggles see i got a straggler right there but if that happened i just i just cut it man no big deal you know i mean i can admit that cutting some can be it's very um fragile so it can be difficult to work with but once you get your little method going you'll be ah you need [Music] this one boom all right so i got a little bit of white up there that i need to get i don't want no white no way to that's why i like these guillotines all right oh i ain't get it it's hard to cut fabric though unless you get actual fabric scissors all a right stragglers i just chop chop chop

My name is Wes. I\u2019m\nfive-eleven and this is the Gildan one hundred percent cotton T-shirt, size medium.   So this is our best value shirt. It\u2019s a hundred percent cotton, but don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not gonna shrink. It\u2019s our standard fit, a little baggier than normal; then a normal\ntailored fit. But the best thing about this shirt is that we do offer up to four and five\nXL\u2019s. Again, it\u2019s our best value shirt, so if you\u2019re having a group event, and you\nwant to order a lot of shirts, this is your shirt.  As the founder of Coed Monkey, I want\nto personally thank you for watching this video. Please let us know if you have any\nquestions, because our goal is offering you the best printed product, and the best customer\nservice in the entire industry. And we can\u2019t wait to make you look amazing in your custom\nprinted t-shirts.", "BE4Ddg_1_FA": "Today we're talking about the Canvas\n100% ring-spun cotton t-shirt. Now this is one of our favorite ring-spun\ncotton t-shirts. One because of how many colors it's offered in, love it that it\ncomes in so many cool colors. It's also great because it comes in a lady's\nversion too, the Bella 100% ring-spun cotton shirt. It has a great fit, love this shirt so much. It actually, I think\nover the course of a lot of washes it maintains that softness which was a big thing for a hundred percent ring-spun. Instead of just telling you though, we do have our model. He's gonna come over show it in action. First thing you're gonna notice is just that tailored fit, partially\nbecause of the side seam here. The side seam makes sure that it just kind of hugs the body. It's not going to be too tight, but it is gonna tailor in a little which is just flattering. Everybody wants now kinda that nicer fabric but also the nicer fit.  The next thing you're going to notice is the neckline. We love this because it's a great dip here not too tight either, has some flexibility. That ring-spun cotton has a little more tug to it than just a regular, 100% cotton. The sleeve length is also awesome, super flattering it's a little higher. It's not going to be baggy, which is great. Now you might be  wondering though, we've talked a lot about a hundred percent ring-spun cotton, how does it, how does it wear over the course of life? Is it gonna shrink, anything that way. With this garment\nyou're not really gonna have to worry about shrinkage over the first few washes. A year or two years down the line, it could potentially if you're gonna nuke this thing in the dryer but it is pre-shrunk and very true to size, so we love this. Again, like I said though it does come in a ladies version, the Bella 100% ring-spun cotton t-shirt. Overall, great shirt, love it, a ton of color options and you look great in it too. Thank you. On the Coed Monkey Soft Scale we rate this t-shirt a two. Thanks for watching this video please let us know\nif you have any questions because here at Coed Monkey, Soft Matters, and so do our customers.", "pT-l_XSqq18": "especially returning these these don't buy the Hutton these t-shirts are hot garments like don't even buy those YouTube what is going on in Detroit GZ in AEG bean Kesey and in today's video we're gonna be trying on all of these t-shirts all these white tees that are either from H&M Zara in your knee glow and we're trying to find out which one is the best white t-shirt for your essential wardrobe rotation going through different fabrics price and also the fitting so let's go ahead and talk about it before watching this video is that in my personal opinion there really is no such thing as a perfect white t-shirt that can last you for decades not really anyway or not not necessarily one brand name that I have gone to because if there was I would have found it by now and a big reason behind making this video is that a lot of people are curious as far as what the differences are between these white shirts compared to another brand just putting that out there so anyways let's go ahead and do this just a zoom out here real quick okay so the way we're gonna format this I'm just gonna go shirt by shirt try them on and we're gonna go through some categories like fit price comfort ability and also things like fabric if I leave out any of those details in a particular t-shirt we could talk about it in the comment section below okay first up we got these through neck dry color t-shirts by you to blow and I bought a large and I bought an extra-large I've never tried them on as full crew I've never even seen this actually this is kind of like in their pajama section seven dollars and ninety cents almost ten bucks per shirt maybe there's two of them in here I don't know what about to find I was going to open this up I'm hoping that these are returnable though got it fabric is not bad it's kind of soft not bad it does look a little bit see-through mind go ahead and try this one on first this is a size large by the way alright for the sake of this video I'm taking my chain off it's a little too thin for me it definitely feels way more of a kind of feels like a pajama like I just kind of mentioned if I'm looking in the mirror biggest drawback to this is that you can actually see my wife beater underneath like look how see-through that it's like I bet you if I didn't have this wife beater on could totally seen it would I absolutely hate what teachers do that like it sucks it looks really stupid I look stupid you look sooo the Libyan rebels you already know what it is let's just try on the extra large for kicks and giggles anyway but we already know that this t-shirt is just not it okay this one's looking a little more promising as I'm trying it on as far as size goes I mean extra large honestly fits like a large I'm a my true to size is a large I bet you through the camera you can see my pants can you see my pants like if you can see your pants through the t-shirt or through the t-shirt no this it's an automatic no like I just like nipples and pants you can see my nipples and you can see my boxers and pants through your t-shirt then you shouldn't even be wearing a t-shirt doesn't even make sense I would say for sure these are more of like a pajama and I don't even know for sure if they are for pajamas or not the only Plus that I would say to this t-shirt that I do like is that this collar is actually kind of tight the neck area actually stays the same size as the size large which I like because if I end up sizing up maybe to a double X which I don't even think they have double exit you know go for this t-shirt and I was looking at the top and there was just only XL ring of the next day is the same size which is good because if you end up getting two sizes up are size up the the ring of the next not gonna get like you know two inches bigger an inch bigger kind of suck sometimes good then you can see your collarbone I mean that's great but that is enough for me to keep this t-shirt where you can see nips wife-beater boxers and pants no go I'm gonna put this one to the side for now okay so this is the super thin Yuna globe t-shirt you see my hand like you can you can see my hand right okay so then now we're gonna put the thicker one on here hold on now can you see my hand it's way harder so like clearly this one is like way thicker so just the thin t-shirts like just stay away from these these suck okay next brand we got up is we're gonna talk about Zara and we bought one t-shirt out of this whole stack of t-shirts that is from Zara and this is actually a shirt that I'm very familiar with so let's go ahead and try it on first still got the tag on I'm already I'm keepin the shirt I already know I am because I own I own a couple of these and reason why I absolutely love these shirts is because they're not seeing through very different than what we just tried on this one you can't see through it and if you can't comment and let me know that you can see this I mean as far as I know you can't see my wife later you probably can't see my pants either also I like the fit too it's not like boxy not like crazy boxy words like too high here this is a size large but it does fit between like large and XL if that if that's not even like really a size but if I were to just like give you a gauge of what it kind of fits like and I love that I love that it comes down to here cuz it covers up my farmers can just keep it in one it doesn't rise that's too high doesn't rise down too low not trying to be like too trendy I love it the fabric is also very soft these do come in at a whopping $20 and also a very quick tip for this t-shirt from Zara is that they make them usually in like three colors black white I think like a beige color and I think that's it but as far as I know right now these are kind of like year-round because when I first started buying these shirts ending 2017 beginning 2018 I started buying these shirts from Zara and these are not like the cheap shirts because they make like three or four different batches of different types of white t-shirts they have ones that are super see-through they suck they have like elongated ones I pass on those samples with zippers I also pass on those but this is just like your regular mundane white t-shirt but it's like a little bit of fabric softening is actually very nice too for some people you might even eat the size down but for me I just go true to size I go with a large it works for me and also best thing about it is if you wash it and dry it it doesn't wrinkle as much especially for being you know it being a cheaper t-shirt $20 t-shirt it is what it is I love it let's go ahead and move on to the next shirt okay next shirt we got up is another unit load shirt I literally bought these without without even looking at them and I didn't know it came with a pocket tried my best not to buy t-shirts for this video with pockets but you know we're already here at this point we already have both of the t-shirts in a size large and also an XL let me try on the size large first size large it does look a little oversized already kind of even bigger than the shirt that I have on and also it looks a little bit more boxy but let's go ahead and try it on and see how this goes and wow this is very this is like pretty oversized hold on it's all it's oversized I'm very boxy actually well I'm not bad I'm kind of impressed to be honest it's not a bad shirt this is a little longer than what we just tried on but it's actually not really like technically boxy because it has this little I don't know what you call this it has like a break here and then it comes down lower in the back but which is which is kind of cool if you're looking for a boxy t-shirt and if you're at Uniqlo I would try these out in addition to that I would say the fabric is pretty nice the fabric is a little thinner than these are t-shirt that I just tried on I don't know how these will hold up in the wash way better than the like pajama type t-shirt and I don't know if you can see can you see my wife beater through it if I do this and you can see the wife beater then it's bad if I do that obviously because you know you see the crease there but if you can see right through it I'm assuming you can't because the fabric is like a little bit thicker I guess right not bad I would say the only thing pushing me away from buying this is this whole little trendy thing I've kind of stayed away from buying t-shirts that do this like little breakage here because I'm really just not into it anymore it just kind of reminds me of going to Zara and then paying for those are teas that have like zippers and weird cuts and kind of like dated back like four or five years I just try to stay away from those and just try to get like regular t-shirts also if you like cigarette holder pocket King that's also a cool thing too I also stay away from t-shirts that have these pockets I don't know why I don't I don't use the pocket much I don't smoke cigarettes I don't have anything light enough to put in my pocket if that makes sense okay we can go ahead and try on the extra-large anyway even though the large fits we can go ahead and try on the extra-large just to show you the size difference seeing that this is an extra-large I'm already we already know this is gonna be huge but anyways this is yeah it's just it's a little too boxy for me the large fit extra-large probably pass on it let's go ahead and move on to the next shirt okay next t-shirt up is from H&M not much to say about it other than the fact that I just I literally walked right eighty-thousand where's the white t-shirts found it purchased it and I just kind of held it up against my body the launch looked too small I only grabbed an extra large so I don't have large and extra-large to compare today so let's go ahead and try this on and then see the difference so as we know when it comes to like the tiers of fast fashion you talked about hmm chuckles ara you know globe whatever other fast fashion houses there are out there those are like the top three in tears it's like you know close at the top bars in the middle and sometimes they battle between top and middle and then H&M is pretty much the bottom of the barrel when it comes to that depending on the item of course all of you eyes I would say this is way thinner this fits and feels exactly like you know Glo JAMA t-shirt that is super thin it literally feels like it's from the same exact Factory my guess is that if I end up washing this and drying it it's it's like toast like literally it is probably a t-shirt that you can only wear once and then once you dry it comes out of the dryer it's like all crinkled and then on top of all of that hmm ste shirt is see-through you can totally see through it if I didn't have my wife beater on you would see nibbles and I'm telling you right now nobody on my channel would want to see that it is but if you really are I guess Ram conscious or a brand loyal to H&M and if you really want to get these shirts I would say size up this extra-large definitely feels like a large to me doesn't really feel like an XL this feels like more of like a pajama t-shirt not even for sports more pajamas a shirt that you just don't care about next shirt okay so the next and final shirt that we have up here is again from Uniqlo we're going back to Uniqlo really quick I've really wanted to talk about these because these have kind of been in conversation with a couple other channels and then also some of my friends have been wearing these as well and they've been recommending this t-shirt to me these are a little bit thicker than the previous Uniqlo t-shirts that we're talking about here today but they're a different fabric they are called crewneck short sleeve t-shirt I mean I hate when they can you give it a different name let's let's just try it on entertain myself a little bit here I'm gonna try the XL on before I try the large on even though I've never tried XL on before so the XL is actually not that bad sizing wise can't see through it right well I can't anyway it's a little too thick for you to see through this is definitely gonna be a lot warmer of a t-shirt compared to the others I would definitely not name this as a pajama t-shirt a lot thicker than actually a majority of the t-shirts that we try on here today but the only difference between this and the others are a t-shirt and you know glow like trendy fitting shirt which I will maybe give the name here is that the fabric on this is a little bit rougher on the skin it's definitely not like a soft fabric this kind of feels like like recycled fabric if like against your skin it does anyway and then also it doesn't like when you do this I know this is like a straight really strange example but when the fabric kind of rubs against your pants and also either a wife-beater underneath and stuff it just it feels like a fabric is gripping on to whatever other fabric it's touching I still prefer the Zara t-shirt over this one as far as fabric goes and also fit even though this is an extra large not really too bad of a fit I would say but let's go ahead and try all the large this is the XL let's see what the large fits like okay this is a lot smaller okay the large large works I think I think large is what do you guys think it's hard to maybe harder to tell on camera but I guess if you want the oversize fit then go for the XL or go for the size up these fit pretty true to size like this is a very true to size large I would say it definitely has a different feel since it does feel a little bit smaller than the extra-large the same specs as this this is just a large compared to an XL it kind of works out it's not bad whether or not I'll keep this one hard to say I have to I have to sleep on this one I don't know it's not it's definitely not perfect the fit is nice the collar is nice you definitely get a thicker color on these on these you do glow ones and you kind of get like this human-made looking collar the collar is a little bit tighter than the Zara one that I like so much out of this bunch but as far as like fabric goes I don't really like this fabric that much I do like the Zara one a little better because it's a lot softer than this one in particular [Music] it's my shirt here real quick yeah just have to kind of summarize this whole thing and I've been wanting to make a video like this for a long time and making a video like this just before we talk about the rest of this here is very difficult because there's too many variations when it comes to white t-shirt and also there is a lack of affordable essential t-shirts that are good geordie I would say 90% 99% besides the one percent that I want to talk about here today I actually like and I will actually keep I'm literally only going to keep one of these t-shirts and it's actually originally the t-shirt that I liked to begin with the Uniqlo one's fabric really isn't soft enough compared to the Zara t-shirt and also the Uniqlo t-shirt that had the better fabric ended up having like that really weird cut on the side of the t-shirt I'm not really a big fan of that those those type of teachers to me just feel a little bit too trendy and I'd like my t-shirts to just be regular mundane shirt instead of like some like fad fit if that's like the right words for it out of the bunch the best one is the Zara t-shirt I don't always shop as ara I know I've made a couple videos either about Zara I do talk about Zara some of my flannels suffer from Zara but you know Zara has a good like 3% of their products that I like okay the rest of them are a little bit too trendy for me and usually the quality is checked a little bit too low but as far as the Zara teacher goes compared to the rest of them I would say the thick is true to size and also the fabric is soft enough I know for a fact that these kind of last through the storm of washing them over and over and over and over and them also keeping the same shape and not wrinkling so much because of whatever particular fabric this is I think in total today I spent like how much should I spend I probably spent like over 100 it's like 120 if you're wondering yes I'm returning stuff especially returning these these don't buy these don't buy these you see these crewneck dry dry color teeth don't buy these these are these are these are pretty bad trends trash if you want to show nipples in your t-shirt and you want to show your belt while wearing the t-shirt at the same time then go ahead and buy these but if not then t-shirts are hot garbage like well don't even buy those so with all that was said today make sure you guys are girls keep the lock right here for our latest information from clothing music to culture it is your boy and I'll see you next time peace Stosh it minute yeah wait a minute we don't say whatever happened to coming into Thomas baby whatever color whatever happen to come into Dolman that's all I want to know me", "p2obXDebFb0": "today I'm wearing the Gildan 5000 hundred percent cotton crewneck the fabric actually feels pretty nice it's definitely a different feel than the Bella canvas shirts that I was wearing earlier but still like nice and soft really durable it feels like a strong shirt that you can kind of wear outside and do some chores with so yeah it's it's a good feel it's uh it's a little restricting on the neck a little bit tighter than I usually wear my shirts but other than that the shoulders are nice and loose nice slim fit down the body the length again just like the the Bella canvas it's a great length shirt it's not going to turn into a crop top and you throw your hands up so you can see myself wearing a shirt basically anytime I'm going outside kind of seems like that like a heavy more durable shirt that I can do some chores nice and baseball I'd say my favorite thing about this shirt is probably just the the durability of it it feels like strong fabric so when I'm out playing pickup football at the beach or something like that it's not one of those shirts that I really have to worry about it's it's inexpensive and it's durable so it's just yeah just gonna be a great outdoor shirt the Gildan 5000 hundred percent cotton tee get it today", "O8l91YENkSk": "[Music] it's a common misconception that GCG only works on 100% cotton teas so we're going to dispel that myth and show you that it's possible to get an awesome DTG print on a Bella canvas tri-blend team today we're headed to tea Puri an online e-commerce platform that sells limited-edition pop culture shirts and a big-time printer in the DTG space tea theory has tested a lot of different try blends from different manufacturers out there and we're going to check out those results firsthand so this is stafford the production manager at tea theory so what do you look for when you're evaluating the quality of a DTG print well number one is how well does it hold the white base number two is the vibrancy of color and number three is the clarity of detail and as you see here fella canvas holds the white very well the white really pops and the red really pops and then we have one of our competitors tribe lens over here and this one is a card open-end you can see the actual weave in the shirt which is not a good size and is that because it's card open-end yes okay say thicker a thicker weave which does not hold color as well so another reason our tribe lens works better than other brands for DTG is because ours are the only tribe lens with a 40 single knit needle with DTG the yarn diameter has a huge impact on the way the shirt accepts the ink and a higher single count means there is a smoother surface for printing so is there anything different in the print process from when you are printing tribe ones versus 100% cotton well when we do no test I wanted to do a baseline so I predicted all the tribe lines I would a normal form say cotton shirt and I found that the Bella canvas I didn't need to change any settings they're all same pretreat and the same equate as one hundred honors Agana and has this shirt been washed your test for new you always want washed shirt because part of the reason was tribal and is the ink may not stick to the shirt one thing is important mention is that one hundred percent cotton it's always would be better because cotton is a breathable fabric it accepts the ink better and another thing to know about our tribe lens is we're actually the only ones in the industry that offer a solid tribe one so it's really nice to just have this solid color what's still that soft hand versus are you know heathered tribe amok that's great for us because the jordan shirts which sell are what are just all black all black so I know that you tested a lot of different tribe lens from some of our new colors that we added this year so we were really impressed by the way that the teeth turned out so let's take a look at them oh so as I was mentioning earlier we added a ton of new solid tribe ones this year we really focused our traveling category on the solid tribe lens this print is beautiful it came out great and up to how many colors can you use for a DTG print that's what's great about these printing you can print anything any color print up to 20 colors yeah this for screen printing would be a very expensive print because of all the colors right right but through DPG you can mix any color it mix it in the print there you have it hopefully you were feeling inspired to do some of your own DTG printing on a bella canvas trevelin we love hearing from you if you have any tips of your own for DTG printing on blends leave them in the comments below and don't forget to subscribe to your YouTube channel we've got tons more content on the DTV movement coming your way [Music]", "TU5rGP10SNE": "if you're curious about the next level 3600 like this one right here then this is a video you do not want to miss [Music] in the last video we talked about the Gildan soft style geez 64,000 and today in this video we're going to talk about the oh so popular next level 3600 [Music] there are a ton of blank t-shirt options out there to choose from and this is the second in our shirt review video series there are a few important things you need to consider when trying to choose which t-shirt is right for you comfort style color options price and print ability let's start by talking about comfort this shirt is made out of 100% combed ring-spun cotton what that means to you and I is this is an extremely soft t-shirt because this is a cold drink spun cotton t-shirt it's softer than your standard cotton which you'll find in like a guild in G 5000 and also your ring spun cotton is like your gilding soft style t-shirts the next level 3600 t-shirt is comparable to the Bella canvas 3000 won and the American Apparel 2001 t-shirt which are all combed ring spun cotton and what that means is they're all extremely comfortable t-shirts now it's time to talk about styling this shirt is definitely a fashion fitted tee which is why it's really popular with clothing lines and band merchandise this shirt has a baby ribbed collar it's got side seams and a tearaway label one thing that I've noticed after wearing these shirts for a very long time is after extensive use the bottom seam of the t-shirt can actually start to come unraveled so that's just something to take into consideration this shirt definitely wears a lot longer than a lot of other t-shirts so if you compare it to like the Gildan soft style G 64,000 it's gonna be come down lower on your body this is definitely one of our most popular t-shirts at Twin City tees and also one of our most recommended this shirt comes in extra small through Forex l when it comes to shirt colors the next level colors are definitely limited compared to your Bella canvas and gild and t-shirts although the shirt colors that they do offer are very good ones as for price this is definitely one of the most affordable fashion fitted combed ring-spun t-shirts on the market it will of course cost a little more than your ring spun cotton and standard cotton t-shirts as you can see here on our chart this is our price here at Twin City tees this is for 50 t-shirts with a one color print and this is just to show you where this shirt lines up among a lot of our other popular t-shirt options I want to make it very clear that these prices are subject to change okay next let's talk about screen printing when it comes to printing at Twin City tees we use water-based and discharge inks primarily and because of that the dye lot of the t-shirt is extremely important and what a dye lot is is where they actually dye the fabric of the t-shirt to give it its color next level dyes their t-shirts and multiple factories around the world and because of this they're starting to show a little bit of inconsistencies and dialogues here I'll show you an example right here as a counterexample Bella canvas actually manufactures their shirts all over the world but they dye them all in the United States which gives them a lot more control among their dialogues as a customer you shouldn't have to concern yourself with this too much I just bring it up to let you know that as next level has grown some of their quality control has fallen a little bit so that's something to pay attention to in the future but when it comes to dye lots at Twin Cities it's our job to make sure that you guys get a high quality product with consistent printing so we'll take care of the dialogue issues so you don't have to worry about anything as mentioned before the next level 3600 is definitely one of our most popular t-shirts we print thousands of them a month they're soft they're stylish and they come in a great price point so if you're trying to choose which t-shirt is right for your business band or group consider the next level 3600 so now there's only one thing left for you to do click on the link below fill out an estimate let us know you want the next level 3600 if that is indeed what you want and before you know it you'll have t-shirts of your own if you're curious about the guild and saw style G 64000 check out this video next we'll see you in the next video", "IvxaCYaYnD4": "hi everyone this is rene romeo of rene romeo calm today you're going to learn eight different ways to repair a hole in a t-shirt so my t-shirt has three holes in it because the kiddies have been climbing on me and if you have an old t-shirt that's been relegated to the back of the closet well go ahead and grab it and use one of these eight methods to repair your t-shirt so you could start wearing it all over again so I'm starting with an old t-shirt here and I have a very sharp pair of scissors so I'm just going to go ahead and poke eight holes into this t-shirt now what this is going to do it's going to allow me to put each one side-by-side and then I'll go ahead and I'll actually launder this when it's done just to see how well that repair held up now I'm using a 100% cotton t-shirt today and six of the repairs that I'm going to make are going to involve some type of polyester or polyamide along with some type of adhesive to make that repair but if you want to keep this 100 percent cotton then you're going to grab 100 percent cotton thread and you're going to make those repairs with a needle and thread now I've taken the t-shirt I've turned it inside out so I'm now working on the backside of the t-shirt I've taken a piece of craft paper and I've slid it underneath the hole and this is going to actually make the hole a little bit more visible for me to work on and it'll protect the ironing board cover from any adhesive that I might get on it so I have three different versions of 100% polyester fusible interfacing my versions come in a lightweight medium weight and heavy weight and that also means that there's a lightweight version with lightweight adhesive medium weight adhesive and heavy weight adhesive so we're going to see which one works best on our 100% cotton t-shirt so here's hole number one now I'm taking a toothpick and I'm just going to kind of coax this together a little bit before I get going here and try to get this hole to look as small as possible once I do that I could take my iron set on the wool setting and with steam at this point so we're going to try to get this hole to come together as much as possible and iron it nice and flat flat I have a square piece of interfacing cut out this one happens to be the lightweight version so the one side that has the adhesive on it I'm going to stick this straight down on top of the backside of that fabric and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a press cloth now my press cloth happens to be flannel it's just a white piece of flannel and it's dampened with water and wrung out I'm gonna take this damp cloth place it over the top of this and try not to move that little piece that I cut out then the iron comes straight down wool setting with steam and it's going to sit there for 10 seconds and I'm going to look at this and see how well this stuck to the fabric now that seems really good now I'm going to press it from the right side and see how well I did in comparison you can kind of see that it's still there so let's see if we could do one better on the next one and this time I'm going to take a little more time with the toothpick making sure that this fabric gets close together before I iron it this time I'm going to go back in and I'm going to make sure that these little pieces of thread are almost touching before I press it one more time now this is my medium weight interfacing I have the adhesive on this side and I decided to trim this in a circle this time just to see if there was a difference so it gets placed straight down on that fabric I have my press cloth again that's nice and damp that gets placed right on top of it and then the iron goes straight down for 10 seconds looking pretty good I'll flip it over and iron it from the front side now this one looks a little better than the first one so let's see if we can get even better with the third [Music] so the next two t-shirt repairs I'll make are with a fabric called poly amide and this poly amide is really a wonderful aquella and the reason why is because it's adhesive on both sides so the first thing you're going to do is you're going to make a patch out of some type of fabric so mine happens to be flannel I don't have a corresponding knit fabric that'll match this so I'm going to use flannel for this then I'm going to take the poly amide and I'm going to put it directly over the top of this patch and I'm going to cut it exactly the same size now here's the patch so I have the flannel underneath and I have the poly imide on top and I'm going to place this directly on top of that hole just like that then I'll take the pressed cloth and I'm just going to lay this down again this is damp and the wool setting is chosen on my iron for ten seconds now hopefully you can see here that this isn't the greatest way to make this patch because it doesn't exactly adhere to all the edges unless you have that cut out perfectly so let me show you a better method to make a patch for the next hole so this next product is also a poly amide but this one happens to be nice and evenly transparent all the way through and it comes with some parchment paper so this parchment paper is going to help us get the best patch possible so this next version of poly imide is really transparent all the way through and you know what you can't stretch it as much as the other versions so it may be --have a little bit differently and I'm also going to be using a smaller patch this time just to see in comparison how all these work out in the wash so I've trimmed it out a little larger than the patch I'm going to set it right on top of that so I've got my craft paper my patch the poly amide and then here's a little piece of the parchment paper that came with the product so this is going straight face down on this I'm taking my wool setting on my iron and setting that in place for ten seconds and I can lift that off and now this has become the perfect patch so what I can do now is I can trim this all the way up to the edges and now I can very carefully peel off that parchment expose the adhesive underneath now I'm ready to go ahead and patch it on to this hole well that looks really nice you know what the entire surface is stuck all the way around let's see what it looks like from the front so the next product I'll demonstrate for you is called mending tape now this is the product that people would probably point you toward if you told them you had a hole in your shirt you needed to mend and the thing about this though is that it's for woven fabric so that means like a dress shirt type of fabric it comes in all different colors depending on whatever type of shirt you have but the thing about this is that the reason why it might work for this is because the adhesive is a heavy adhesive on the back of it so what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and cut this out and I'm going to do a small circle again because I think that was the most successful of all the patches so far well this one might be the best yet it's the thinnest but you know what it took about 30 seconds of dry heat to get here along with a little bit of pressure so the last two holes are going to be repaired with some cotton thread you see I have some cotton thread I have a very very thin needle I have a magnifying lamp you don't need this but you know what it makes the job so much easier you can look through the magnifying glass and you can actually see every single thread as you go through so now that the thread is through the head of the needle I'm going to the long end of the thread and I'm just going to make a knot so I have thread between my index finger and my thumb I'm going to wrap it around just like so and then I'm going to take it up and twist it and you can kind of see I'm kind of twisting it there take my third finger pull it nice and tight and now I've got a nice knot right there so your engineers the same exact way so the real trick here is to grab one thread from one side and then one thread from the other and pull it through just like that now don't do it so that it's you know so super tight you just need to grab one little end here and we're not wanting to pucker the fabric so much so you're just going to go ahead and kind of go back and forth until you can't see the hole any longer so just back and forth here grabbing a little loop on either side running that needle through the loop till you get to the end of the hole all to finish it off I'm going to go through this kind of mending area not into the t-shirt fabric itself do one loop and then try to pull that a little bit tight and then come back through go through the loop and pull that nice and tight now I can trim it off the repair is complete but let's see what it looks like from the front side well there you have it let's iron it and see if we can get that to flatten out now I'm on the last hole I'm working on the back side again I'm getting this all set with my toothpick and I'm going to press it in place this last one I'm going to do with fabric glue so your typical fabric glue that you can get at the fabric store I'm just going to dab it on there and let it dry so here's the t-shirt fresh out of the dryer now I have this on a normal wash cycle along with a high heat dry cycle so let's do a side-by-side comparison on the backside of the shirt and see how these repairs held up so here's the 100% polyester lightweight patch here's the 100% polyester medium weight patch here's the 100% polyester heavyweight patch here's the poly amide patch that we made from the loose weave fabric here's the poly amide patch that we made from the transparent fabric and here's the mending tape and here's the hand stitched version and then there's the glued version so you can make your own mind up about what looks best from the back and what you think is going to hold up over time but then let's look at the front and they all look pretty similar these patches are going to actually prevent this t-shirt from unraveling a little further but you can see as you get a little heavier weight in your patches from underneath you're going to notice the outlines so in looking at this t-shirt not only from the front but from the back I really think that there are three successful repairs here the first one being the 100% lightweight polyester patch this one actually blends in seamlessly with the t-shirt fabric you can't even tell it's there the second one I would say would be the glue now the glue there's only one problem with it it dries shiny so if you have a little opening in the front of your shirt you might have a little glisten of glue that you can kind of detect there but otherwise it looks really great and the third one is the hand stitch version now this one is going to definitely be the most secure over time they look identical all of them from the front so you can choose whichever one you want and here your old t-shirt and wear it again and again and even during laundering this will hold us and if none of those options appeal to you well then you can go ahead and you can get a bunch of beads and you can bedazzle your shirt wherever you have a hole well there you have it eight ways to repair a hole in a t-shirt you know what this is such a great life 101 lesson you're going to extend the life of your wardrobe you're going to save money and you're going to keep those items out of the donation pile so

"I'm starting a t-shirt line what's the best shirt to use I can honestly say this is the number one question I get asked to answer that you have to consider what is most important to you about your brand what people starting a t-shirt line usually care about the most is fit feel fashion and how they can be decorated so let's see if I can answer that number one question for you up next [Music] hey guys it's melissa my shirt space when it comes to finding the best t-shirt to start a t-shirt line what you'll first want to consider is your brand's aesthetic if you feel like your brand is more about the design than the shirt I would consider using the g500 okay what I'm referencing here is brands that tend to be about funny slogans or silly images personally I wouldn't consider a brand like this to be a fashion-forward brand so what classic tubular team might be your best bet but I'm guessing that people watching this video are more interested in starting a fashion-forward clothing brand when it comes to a fashion-forward clothing brand that appeals to all genders I can definitely give some more recommendations and again we will want to touch on what matters most fit feel and fashion let's start with fit this is a big one everyone wants to look good and feel good but plains of both genders can be hard this is where manufacturers have stepped up to create the retail unisex team this slim-fitting tee that caters to both genders will be a hit for sure next let's touch on feel a soft comfortable tea will be something that your customers will not forget so this is where fabric comes into play there are three recommendations I would make on fabric the first is cotton the second is CVC and the third is try blend let's talk a hundred percent cotton 100% cotton is a tried-and-true tea it's only downfall is that it will shrink after its first wash but if you provide your customers with the correct wash instructions to follow they will be sure to fall in love next up is CVC cv c stands for chief value cup this refers to the cotton poly ratio within the tea with a heavy percentage of cotton these teas provide the softness of the cotton and the durability and texture of the polyester finally we have our try blends this is a blend of 50% poly twenty-five percent cotton and 25% ring a triflin is very similar to a CVC but with an added feature you have your softness of your cotton your durability and texture of your polyester but then with that round you also get some added features these fabrics all have a very price point depending on where you'd like to be for your customer base okay let's talk fashion a huge trend in the fashion world right now is street wear so how does this apply to choosing a teeth well the unisex tee is one of the hottest things in the street wear market right now so you should definitely consider everything that I've touched on when choosing your fashion-forward teeth but I know what you're thinking WTF I just wanted her to tell me the answer well it's your lucky day here are my top picks or starting a t-shirt line first we have the Bella canvas 3001 seat this is a 4.2 ounce hundred percent cotton retail fit the shirt comes in a number of amazing colors and also has a tearaway label and it also comes in a CTC option next up we have the n62 10 by next level this shirt is made up of 60% cotton and 40% polyester it's a 4.3 ounce and comes with a tearaway label as an added bonus now for our tribe ones first up we have the tr4 o1w weighing in at a 3.7 ounce making it a great lightweight option finally we have my personal favorite it's the three four one three seat by bella canvas it's a three point eight ounce retail fit with unisex sizing side seams and a tearaway label oh and it's also preshrunk what's

be disappointed", "boX_isNul7M": "Today we're talking about the District\nThreads 100% ring-spun cotton t-shirt. Now, over the past few years this has\nbecome one of the most popular and most demanded T-shirts we've seen, for a few reasons. One is the price point, two is the color options, and three is just the fit and fabric. It feels great, fits great and again, that price point is amazing. So, so many bands look at this shirt as their standard at merch tables. Instead of just telling you\nabout it though, we do have our model coming over and we're gonna show it off.\nNow, first thing you're gonna notice is it is a great fit but there's no side seam here, which that's, that kind of\nbegs the question, what does that mean? Well, without a side seam we can\nactually do more of a wrap logo, which is very popular. If we had a side seam\ngoing down the side, it could be an uneven print right there, which makes the ink\nkind of bunch up and not be as good. So this is perfect if you want to have a wrap logo. The next thing we're gonna talk about though is just this neckline. It's bound on the\ninside, super clean neckline here. 100 percent cotton has a good stretch to it without being too\nstretchy. The sleeve length is pretty generous here. It's a little longer than, maybe the comparable Next Level or American Apparel, but still hits at a great point here, not baggy at all. It comes in great colors, and like I said before a great price point for this shirt. 100 percent ring-spun cotton, now you might be wondering, does that mean it's gonna shrink? How should I wash it? What size should I order? It fits very true to size, on top of that, it is a hundred percent ring-spun, so you're not gonna have to really worry about shrinking it. A year or two years down the line if this becomes\nyour favorite t-shirt, I'd just say, don't nuke it in the laundry. You know, kinda keep it to that mid to low heat, because cotton, over the course of its life, could shrink. Cotton also can pill, so, if you're looking for\nlongevity of a shirt, I'd recommend maybe looking at the District Threads 60/40 blend or\nmaybe a Canvas, Next Level, American, one of their 50/50's if it has to wear and re-wear every week for volunteers or maybe, if you're ordering for employees that have to wear it. But this is a great price point, 100% ring-spun cotton, same line of thought as the Next Level or Canvas in terms of pricing. Cheaper than American Apparel though and the Alternative Apparel. So, if you're looking for a great price point go with this, which is why we get it demanded so much. Thanks so much, you look awesome in it! On the Coed Monkey Soft Scale we rate this t-shirt a two. Thanks for watching this video please let us know if you have any questions because here at Coed Monkey, Soft Matters and so do our customers.", "lAM90VD1y8g": "What's up garment decorators! We're here\nto talk to you today about some dye sublimation. Did you know you can dye\nsublimate on more than just 100% white polyester t-shirts? I'm AJ, this is Kirk, we're going to show you today on how to do different blends of t-shirts and a\nwide range of colors. First we pressed 100% polyester t-shirts.\nYou can see we did white, a columbia blue, and a dark grey. All the same exact print, and as you can see with 100% polyester, after you wash, the colors stays the same. You're never going to have any fading when you use 100% polyester, but you are going to have the different contrast of the color coming through the inks. As you can see here on this white, the colors were super vibrant. You know, white is the best for colors. But, also, there's some cool effects on the columbia blue. Really like the colors. I like it. The look is what, you know it makes it totally different. As you can see, the\ncolor, even between the yellows on the grey - totally different. So what we did, we went and found some tri-blends, because I like more of a softer shirt. I'm kind of the guy, that kind of t-shirt snob, so I liked that type of stuff. So we went and found some tri-blends and these are like 75% polyester they got\n12% of the rayon and also 13% of your cotton. And so you look at, is like when I\npress this, I mean like what do you think? (It's cool) It looks good. But when you washed it, we're going to have a little bit of fading to it. But, I think it still overall looks great. So obviously you can do the traditional white, but then you also, your wash look, you're going have a little bit of fading. I'm a big fan of the sublimation on color. It kind of gives you that a little bit more to offer your\ncustomers. What do we have on? My favorite - 50% polyester, 25% cotton and 25% rayon. It's another style at tri-blend, but it's\nreally nice as well. It has a really fresh look when you press it. So don't get used to that, because as soon as you wash it you're going to get that better cool of a washed out look that a lot of people are going for these days. I like it. I mean I like the feel, and I think kinda of has\nthat faded look. Already looks like the garment's broken in. When you're pressing AJ, \nyou prefer to use like, when you tack stuff down - you know I'm a guy likes to use the spray. What about you and what else do you use? I like using the thermo\ntape. We have green and clear. Typically green is used more often just\nso you can see it on any color garment. But that's what I like. I like the tape\nit's tried and true. The spray is your favorite. I like using this spray a\nlittle bit. So you just kind of tack along on top of the paper. And it holds it in place. Don't have to use the tape. Just a light mist on the paper and it tacks it right in place so you don't have anything jumping off our ghosting. So more versatile for\nme because I'm doing kind of back and forth But whichever you use, obviously you still get the same results as you can see. So now AJ, let's just talk a little bit about\npricing and make sure that everyone understands like now we're using a lot\nnicer garments - they're tri-blends. So you have a little bit higher end shirt. So\nobviously you factor in obviously your time and your inks and your paper. But now you have the garment that's a little bit higher price. So don't forget now you're\nhaving an very nice garment, so you can charge more and get more for it. So obviously make sure you're getting what you're worth on these garments and\neverything else you're doing, because this is nice stuff and it's neat. So you can get all these different styles of garments that you saw here today by\ngoing to HeatTransferClothing.com And anything in the dye sublimation world\nthat we talked about with the spray or the mist paper or ink by going to HeatTransferWarehouse.com Thank you decorators for watching our video today.

their very own YouTube channel not all t-shirt lamps are created equal alright then we are going to go over good better and best t-shirt lengths with Bella canvas not only that at the end of the video you are going to have the opportunity to win good better and best t-shirt flex because feeling is believing video coming up all right guys I was at the Bella canvas headquarters in Los Angeles California and we went over good better and best t-shirt lengths okay and I was with the head of sales and we are going to show you the difference all right and not only that you're gonna have an opportunity to win all three so you can feel them and see which one you're going to use in your t-shirt business alright so wanna hear hear it go hi Gary from t-shirt helpdesk and I'm here was Meghan she's the head of sales at Bella campus and I know a lot of you guys have questions about t-shirts Heather's try blends solids tell us about what's going on with all I'm gonna give you the run now reposition it kind of a good better best style 3001 is our best-selling style friend the bread and butter of our line that's because made out of 100% combed and ring spun cotton and why that's important is we literally comb out the impurities and then it's ring spun to create a really nice strand of yarn so that when we've met our fabrics it's a tight weave it's a smooth consistency it's a nice surface to print on and it's got that super soft hand so what we'd buy for ourselves at retail so this is gonna the gateway into the brand it's a really nice price point at 287 extremely competitively priced so that's kind of the transition into the brand if someone's maybe using a basics brand and they're trying to elevate their their line and get into something a little bit softer and a little bit nicer in terms of printing alright what are some of the qualities that we can look forward to style like this well the hundred percent cotton lends itself really well to DTG direct-to-garment printing is ideal for taking that type of ink it also discharges really well so I would say that's a good go-to for anyone looking to do DGG or discharging so this is the good category this is kind of that better tide worried this is still style 3001 you'll find that we like to mix fabrications within existing silhouettes so style 3001 will have solid kind of percent cotton colors and then poly cotton color so thisis our other CBC it's a fifty to forty eight poly cotton blend and what makes it unique is that it gives it that nice Heather appearance we're seeing a major trend in the market for customers printing on Heather's because not only that nice vintage texture but also that polyester consider and so at 3:05 this is a good kind of lower price point but step up from the hundred percent cotton and we have a wide variety of colors within the three thousand one so no matter what they're looking for whether it's artwork for the graphic or a logo there's something in our color palette to satisfy their needs very minute so if I have to choose any fabric to represent Bella campus it would be our tri-blend I realize that I'm biased but we have the best try one on the market feel that one hmm so it's a 50% polyester 25% combed in ring-spun cotton 25% rayon blend and it's a 40 single the single is kind of like the thread count the highest single the finer the fabric and with the only brand in the industry to do a 40 single try one so it gives it a really silky hand if you have a customer that likes that heathered appearance but they have a tighter budget they can go with the Heather CVC the try one is gonna be able to form a premium and 459 but it feels really good and we have a 36 colors total which is the most try Blanc colors in the industry and I wish you guys could feel this I mean it feels like love really really soft great product so that was it guys good better best t-shirt out that side alright guys so that was it now this

fleming collection we would have liked to have seen something that ian fleming actually wore you know i don't know if that shirt with the patch pockets in the belt is probably too much cosplay but you

in when you're sitting down for them zoom calls this is the way to go all right until next time [Music] you", "23NiZTv24Uk": "- In style in general it\ndoesn't come more simple than your regular T-shirt. This is an easy stylish\nclassic when it's done right. But when it's not, it he can leave you\nlooking pretty average. There are tonnes of different\nT-shirts to choose from, some of which look great and\nothers of which look terrible. And I thought for this video I'll save you the hard work of looking. I've teamed up with Amazon for this video and they've sent me a load\nof different T-shirts. I'll be trying and testing all\nof the different brands out to see which ones are\nactually worth your money. Which ones fit the best, which\nones are the better quality and of course which are\nthe most stylish over all. I'm your test dummy for this video. Either way you're gonna find the best T-shirt out of all these as well as all the rest\nof the ones I've tried listed and linked in the description. Before I judge these shirts\nand test them out for you, we need to define you know\nwhat makes a good T-shirt. What am I going to be looking for that puts one of these\nshirts above the rest? Okay, there are a couple of\nkey factors really for me. The first one being, the neck has got to fit relatively well. I don't want it super tight\nwhere it's choking me out although it's quite rare to\nfind one that's like that. But also I don't want one\nthat's plunging really deep, that's showing off my man boobs. Secondly, the sleeves\nneed to fit really well. This is one of, if not,\nthe most important thing when it comes to choosing\na good looking t-shirt. Take this T-shirt here for instance. Whatever you think of the design, the fit through the torso is pretty good. It's not super tight but\nit's not really loose. But on the sleeves you've\ngot the dreaded triangle, the bit right at the edge of the sleeve where it spears out to the side because the arm opening is too big. And you're gonna find this same problem in about 80% or 90% percent of T-shirts. These have just been made like this just so that as many guys\nas physically possible can fit inside the T-shirt. It doesn't look tailored to your body and it makes it like you're wearing a size that might be too big and obviously it's got to\nfit well through the torso. I'm not really looking for\na super tight muscle fit one because I don't have the body for it. I want one that's may be a\nlittle bit snug through the chest and then a little bit baggier through the rest of the torso below. Because of those last two factors, all the T-shirts that you're\ngonna be seeing in this video features some sort of stretch. So they've got form of elastane or something similar\nwithin the construction. And you'll also see that each of the T-shirts\nin this video are crewneck because for me with my body it just tends to look\nbetter than the V-neck. But I'm sure there's a V-neck version of each of these available\nanyway, so it doesn't matter. also you'll notice for\neach of these T-shirts I've tried to choose\ndifferent colours for each so that you don't get them\nmixed up with each other. But they are available in other colours other than the ones I'm\nwearing in this video. And first we're going to focus on the one that I'm wearing right now. Let's take a look at the\nCalvin Klein T-shirt. Okay, here's the Calvin\nKlein crew neck T-shirt with 95% cotton and 5% elastane. These are sold in packs of two\nand come in a price point of about 31 pounds. So you look in on average just\nunder 16 quid per T-shirt. It is kind of frustrating that this is only available in a two pack. But overall anyway, how does it look? In terms of overall fit,\nI'd say that this is okay. The fit across the chest\nand through the torso is very, very good. Especially compared to some\nother options that you'll see later in this video. You have the stretch there\nso it's contoured to my torso but it's not super spray-on tight. Looking at the sleeves I'd\nsay this the sleeves are okay. In terms of length down the arm I think these aren't bad at all. I actually prefer these that's set almost banging the\nmiddle of the upper arm. Unfortunately, the actual\narmhole opening at the end that seems to be relatively big compared to some of the\nothers in this video. There doesn't seem to be a great deal of stretch in this area\nwhich is frustrating. The neck area however because it's made of a slightly more solid\ntype of material here tends to retain its shape a\nbit better from what I found. It's about the right size,\ndefinitely not too deep, pretty good so far. But unfortunately as you may have noticed from looking at me in this video, you can see the wire of my\nmicrophone underneath the T-shirt and that's because the\nmaterial is too thin. In certain angles especially in sunlight you can just see straight\nthrough to my nipples. With a brand of this name\nand this sort of price I would expect more. This just kind of reminds\nme of the appearance of like a lower quality undershirt. Overall the Calvin Klein one is okay but it's definitely not\nthe best one on this list. Next we move on to this navy\nT-shirt from Jack & Jones. Now you'll notice an immediate\ndifference with this one compared to the last one. You can tell straight away that this is a lot tighter than the Calvin Klein one. This just advertises as their basic tee, yet to me this looks\nlike a muscle fit one. And I'm normally a size medium, that last one was a size medium, this one looks like I'm wearing a small. The shoulders on this are so narrow that they're sitting way\nhigher up than they should be. And through the body it's\nalmost spray-on tight which is evident by the\nhorizontal pull lines you can see going across all the way down. And bearing in mind I'm\nsomewhere between about five foot nine to five foot 10 and weigh nearly bang on\naverage for my height, there's no way that I should\nhave to be considering going up to a size large. Never in my life have I been close to a size larger than anything. But for this brand in particular if you wanted to get one of these I recommend going a size\nabove what you normally have. Also many comes to the neck here you can see it's even\nquite big around the neck, almost as if it's like an\ninch too big around there. This one does come in at a lot cheaper price about eight pounds, so almost half the price\nof the Calvin Klein but I'm not sure if the\nactual fit is worth it. The material itself\nfeels nice and stretchy and high-quality. It's definitely better quality material than the Calvin Klein one. This one however is 8% elastane. I don't know if that's what's\nmade all the difference here but it's certainly not my favourite shirt. Now it's time to get stripy with this one from Scotch & Soda. Coming in at a price of around 31 pounds, this is definitely one of\nthe more expensive ones in this video. So does it deliver when it comes\nto the fit and the quality? Really I'd say that this is essentially a better version\nof the Calvin Klein one. Again this one has the 95%\ncotton to the 5% elastane. But the shirt itself\nisn't quite as see-through and then the rest of the\nfit is almost identical. Around the neck again it's okay. I maybe like if it was a\ntiny bit smaller for me. But compared to a lot of them\nI'd say it's pretty good. The shoulders are sitting right, much better than the Jack & Jones one. And the sleeves as a whole are okay. It fits a lot tighter\nthan your regular shirt, like the one that I showed\nyou at the start of the video. But I can already see\nafter a couple of wears that it is starting to\njust stick out a tiny bit or maybe it's just telling\nme I need to get to the gym. Through the torso this one\nfits pretty much spot-on. For this one in general I honestly don't have too many complaints. However, it does sit at\nthat higher price point. Will it be worth it by\nthe end of the video? We'll see. For the next two coming up, we've got two options from another well known brands Tommy Hilfiger. Now I decided to buy two here because they had two separate listings for something that look very similar so I wanted to see if they\nactually were the same thing. So got this one in blue and\nthen another one in white. And it turns out the two\nare slightly different. The blue one here is made up of 96% cotton and 4% elastane. I'd say that the fit of\nthis one is still very good. Around the neck area in particular I really like the way that this one sits. It's a tiny bit higher good if you've got quite a thin\nneck and collarbone area. Also this one along with the white one are possibly the most comfortable\nones I think on this list in terms of the way\nthat the material feels also doesn't seem to crease\nvery easily which is good. The shoulder area and torso are I'd say pretty much bang on. Only small gripe I had with this blue one, is that the sleeves, for me, I think the sleeves\nare a little bit too short. It's not far off, it's not bad, it still retains the stretch better than some of the other options, but I'd like if it was\njust a centimetre or so further down the arm. With the white one there was\na couple of small differences. The neck area I'd say exactly\nthe same, it fits really well and through the body\nit's nice and well fitted without being super tight. But you'll notice that\nthe balance of materials is slightly different. According to the label this is\nthe 95 to five ratio instead. Both of these options\ncome in at a higher price of around 35 pounds. And I don't know whether\nit's down to just the colour but this one you can see\nthrough it a little bit. It's certainly not as bad\nas the Calvin Klein one where you can just\nstraight up see through. But I don't know if it's due to having a slightly different material. But what I do like with a white one is that the sleeves make up for it. Because the sleeves on this\none for whatever reason are slightly longer than\nthe previous blue one. It definitely sits\nfurther down on the arm. Not super tight. I maybe like if it was a tiny bit tighter but overall I'd say that this is a very good fit as a whole. Next, we move to the\nother end of the spectrum with this green T-shirt\nfrom Urban Classic. From the 30 pound area down to\njust 11 pounds at the moment. And overall I'm really\nimpressed with this one. I get the thing that I don't\nlike out of the way first. I think that the neck area is definitely a bit on the big side. I'd like it if it was an inch\nor so small around the neck. But other than that I think for 11 pounds this is a really good option. Shoulders are spot on. And then down through the torso this one I think fits me really well. I'd say equally as well as a Scotch & Soda or the Hilfiger ones. Both of which like three times the price. And this is one of, if not\nthe best set of sleeves I think of any of the\nones I'm trying today. It's not too short, it comes down to a really\nnice mid bicep level. And around the area it still\nretains a lot of tightness which is great. The length is fine as is\nwith all of them here. Nice high arm holes. I think that this overall 11 quid is really good value for money. And you still get the\nsame sort of materials that you get with some of these\nother more expensive ones, the 95% cotton to 5% elastane. This one seems like a really good choice if you're on a budget. And the final two one here are\ntwo different black T-shirts. The first one being this\none from Only & Sons. And this one is a bit\nlike the Jack & Jones one, in the sense that it looks like someone has just sprayed\nit on with a paint can. This one advertises as a slim fit but unless you're skeletal\nI'd say that this is like just your typical spray on muscle fit. Once more this is another one unless you want the really tight body conforming fit overall, I probably say go up a size. But if you are a fan of\nthat really tight muscle fit then this is definitely better\nthan the Jack & Jones one. It's only a few pence more, I think it's like 30 pence more\nat the time of filming this. It's the same 95% cotton to 5% elastane but in terms of the way\nit fits in certain areas I think it's a bit better. The neck in particular it's a lot more conformed\nto the neck area, it's not super big. The sleeves are arguably perfect in terms of the way that they fit. Now through the torso it's just really tight\nlike for Jack & Jones one but the material feels like maybe a slightly\nbetter quality material. So if this is the type you\nwant, I'd say go for this one. Or maybe if you're a\nguy that's really thin then this might be the brand to choose. They just need to change it\nto advertised as a muscle fit and then they'll be sorted. And we finished this little rundown by looking at this black\nT-shirt from Garage. Again this is another brand\nI'm not really familiar with but this comes in a pretty\ncompetitive 12 pound 50 ish. And would you know? 95% cotton, 5% elastane. This one again it's more\non the tighter side I'd say but it isn't as tight as the\none that we've just looked at and the one earlier from Jack & Jones. Once more I think this is\na slightly better option the Jack & Jones one. It's a bit better around the neck area, also it seems pretty good\naround the sleeves too. For me, it is a little bit tight through the chest and through the torso but the shoulders are decent and the material feels\npretty good quality. So which is my favourite overall? Which one would I pick out of\nall these different options? This one's actually being quite a tricky decision for me to make. Because several of them on this list actually fitted me really nicely and I think that's the benefits of going for one of these ones\nthat's got the elastane in. You're not left with\ntonnes of baggy material or the spearing triangle on the side. If I could only choose one it would be just about the white Tommy Hilfiger one or at least that range. For me this is probably the\nmost comfortable one to wear. It looks quite stylish as a whole in terms of the shape of\nit, not including the logo. If it's well all over, so\nthe sleeves pretty good, the next decent and then through\nthe torso is good as well. The Scotch & Soda one\nactually surprised me with how good that one was as well. I just think that's the cuts of this one looks slightly better on me, not by much. In terms of budget options though I think that the Urban Classics one is an absolute bargain at that sort of price for the type of material\nthat you're getting. Things really good quality and good value. Also for me the Garage one wasn't far off and that's at a lower price. But if you want the you know\nsuper spray on muscle fits, then the Only & Sons is the best option I think out of the ones I tried today. I love this, these and all\nthe others listed and linked in the description below too. Every purchase that you make through the links in the description helps to support my channel\nso I can keep doing videos just like this one. Which of these was your favourite?

Now, the Bella ladies 100% ring-spun cotton t-shirt is a\ngreat option, great price point, great fit, overall an awesome shirt. I'm going to have\nMaia come over and show it off instead of just talking about it. Right away you're going\nto notice a great fit, tailored side seam means it's naturally going to hug your sides.\nIt's going to offer that more feminine feel to it, 100% ring-spun cotton. It's soft.\n\u200bNow, if we're talking about sizing on this, we do kind of ... Anytime we're talking about\n100% ring-spun, err on the side of ordering one size larger because 100% ring-spun doesn't\nstretch as much as more of a blend does. You'll notice the sleeve length fell a little higher\nthan the unisex version, not baggy at all, naturally complements her body. The other\nthing is the neckline here, a little breathe-ability here. It's not tight up to the neck like some\nt-shirts are. This offers a little breathe-ability here.\n\u200bAll around though, great shirt, a lot of color options and since it's Bella, Bella\nowns Canvas, a unisex t-shirt company so a lot of the colors are interchangeable between\nunisex and ladies. This is great for a ladies group. You can also order the Canvas t-shirt\nfor the larger group of males or just women who maybe want more of a boxy fit, but for\na women's t-shirt, great standard. If we're talking about this versus the American Apparel\nand the Next Level 100% ring-spun cotton, I kind of put this right in the middle. The\nprice point is closer to the Next Level. You save a lot going Bella over American Apparel's\n100%. I believe that you get more out of this shirt too than the American Apparel, which\nis why we probably sell so many of them, although the American Apparel has the name everybody\nreally trusts. Bella is also a name, but anytime you're ordering 100% ring-spun, again, think\nabout ordering one size up in the ladies version because you don't want it to be too small.\n\u200bYou look great in it Maia. Thank you so much. \u200bOn the Co-ed Monkey Soft Scale, we rate this t-shirt a two. Thanks for watching this\nvideo. Please let us know if you have any questions because here at Co-ed Monkey, soft\nmatters and so do our customers.", "qpYGhGNPm7A": "two things that I like I like t-shirts and I like style hacks I'm always looking online to find different little tips and tricks that can help getting dressed easier just help your life in regards to fashion a little bit more simple so one of the tips that I always see online is to make your shirt softer using salt so I was like huh this interests me BASC your t-shirt in salt and then it suddenly comes out softer I'm always buying t-shirts and frankly I like to buy semi expensive t-shirts there are certain lower end brands that work for me but you know I'm a t-shirt junkie I want them soft I want them nice so I thought to myself well if these hacks actually work could I take like a five pack of Target Hanes t-shirts and turn them into an expensive shirt so I could essentially take a $2.00 shirt and turn it into a $100 shirt so I got really excited about it and went to Target about my shirt it's about my salt took a little Bowl and I went to town so this is the new version of the t-shirt from Target PS immense medium a little tiny I would get immense large our boys large excuse me so this is a new one out of the package it feels pretty soft but what I discovered is I think what they're doing is they're putting like some sort of coating on top of the shirt so it feels soft in the package but then once you wash it like the softness washes off so feeling it I'm like well this isn't too bad but don't be fooled so this is the new the star control item okay pretty soft you know looks pretty good so then I found a instructions online on how to make your shirt softer with salt and what they said was to take big pot of water put your t-shirt inside cover it with water add one cup of salt and bring it to a boil okay so bring it to a boil once it hits a boil you put it down to a simmer pop a lid on it and let that baby marinate in that salt water for 45 minutes so I did that watch a little scandal while it was boiling away and then you take it out you put it in the wash and wash it like you would your normal clothes so I had a couple of other things in the laundry use my soap did the whole thing dried it was thinking out crunchy okay this did not work the boiling trick it didn't work this thing feels horrible like it is so far from soft that it's like it's ridiculous and on the site they were saying that they tried it and it worked you know maybe they had a more expensive shirt to start with maybe that's what happened but I do not recommend the boiling technique big ole thumbs down moving right along so then you know this is a five pack I could experiment then I found another recipe that said take bowl of water just regular cold water no boiling required half a cup of salt and soak your t-shirt in it for three days and then wash it as normal so for this one I was like let's just add a little more salt 1/2 a cup didn't seem like enough so I think I added a cup of salt you know I wanted to a speed of the process so I put the shirt in the bowl of salt on a Friday and then Sunday night I took it out instead of washing it in the machine because I thought maybe that would be too harsh I hand washed it with some soap from the laundress and I let it air dry for a bit I tumbled it in the dryer just to soften it up and these are the results now this one feels a heck of a lot better than the boiled shirt like way softer does it feel softer than the the new one not really so the salt trick you know sorry if you got all excited you were like oh cool I'm going to like check out how to do this I just don't know that it works that well I think you should just buy a soft shirt to begin with like I said I hate to burst your bubble but I'm in three days and I wasted like a couple cups of salt I could have cooked with that salt I don't think it's worth it but I will tell you if you do want to try it definitely the three day soaking method Trump's the old boiling method so scrap the boiling so I would love to hear your thoughts if you've tried this and maybe it worked for you maybe I just have no clue how to dip a shirt and salt maybe I just suck at it but if you've done it and it worked please let me know if you've done it and it was horrible - I'd like to hear about that as well so that is how you fail at making sure softer with salt", "YrkDKuA1BGY": "here we have our number one bestseller on blank apparel calm the Gildan g500 Gildan is the biggest t-shirt manufacturer in the world and this is their

first episode of our new printing\nshow here at wekoma with the increase in demand for printed\ncustom apparel and other types of printed goods we decided to create a\nbrand new series where we showcase what today's printers\nare capable of and how your custom apparel business can benefit from them\nso before you go make sure to like and subscribe so you don't miss any of our\nfuture episodes all right with that out of the way let's move on to today's\nepisode in which we are going to be transferring\na design onto a cotton t-shirt using the r550\ntransfer printer and the ricoma flat heat press the r550 white toner transfer\nis a versatile printer that can print full color designs that you can then\ntransfer onto cotton and polyester using a heat press\nand since this is a white toner printer you can actually print bright\nvivid whites on your dark garments also the two-step\nsimply peel transfer media that comes with this printer is a great low-cost\nsolution for high quality garment and textile transfers the sheets have a\nclear coating that protects your printed graphics and prevents cracking when the\nfabric is stretched the transfer sheet is also transparent making it easy to\nposition your graphic correctly on your garment now let's go ahead and get\nstarted all right so let's go over the materials\nwe're going to be using today first up we got our cotton black t-shirt\nthen we have our teflon sheet for our heat press and then here we have the two\nsheets that we're going to be using with the heat press\nand the printer to create our transfer paper so first up we got our transparent\ntransfer sheet this is the one that we print this\ndesign on using the printer and then we combine it with our adhesive\nsheet using our heat press to create our final transfer sheet and\nthen obviously we're using the ricoma r550 white toner transfer printer and\nthe ricoma hp 1515 heat press now the 1515 stands\nfor the surface area of the heat press which is 15 by 15\ninches all right so let's get into the profit potential for these kinds of\nprints so we bought these shirts at wholesale\nat a site called jiffy shirts and they were about 2 dollars and 25\ncents each then the ink and the transfer papers actually cost about\nthree dollars so that puts our entire investment to about five dollars and 25\ncents shirts like these you could sell them\nfor about 15 to 20 dollars so that means that you have a profit potential\nof 9 to 14 around that all right so let's go over to our computer so that we\ncan start printing out our transfer sheet now this software is included with\nthe purchase of the printer like everything else that we're showing\nin this video so if you're interested go down to the link in the description\nall right to do this we are going to be using the icolor pro rip software\nnow in this episode we're really just going to go over an overview of how to\nprint a transfer sheet but in the future we're\ngoing to be making other videos that go more in depth into the software\nso basically all i have to do is grab my design that i already have here on my\ncomputer drag it over to the software and it's\ngoing to appear now all i have to do is wait for the preview to load\nand then i can go ahead and start setting up my project now because of the\nfact that this design was essentially created by a designer\nand it is already created to the dimensions of a regular\nprinter paper of about eight and a half inches by 11 i\nreally don't have to do a lot and in fact the software already puts the\ndesign mirrored so that when i place it on the\nshirt it is in the right orientation all right so since it is already\npositioned where i want it all i have to do is go here select the project\nright click and print all right so i'm going to go ahead and load my\ntransparent transfer sheet onto the printer so that i can print on it\nnow i'm going to be doing that with the matte side up and the glossy side down now as soon as i insert the tray it\nshould already start printing since i already set the design to print\nall right so here we have our hp 1515 heat press now i have the temperature\nset to 310 degrees fahrenheit now before i do any kind of pressing\nwhat i'm actually going to do is preheat the bottom layer of the heat press\nfor about 120 seconds all right so one of the cool things\nabout this heat press is that when the timer is done it'll actually\nautomatically open all right so now that our heat press is\nnice and warm we're gonna take our transparent\ntransfer sheet we're gonna take out the tray and we're gonna put\nour transparent transfer sheet with the glossy side down again\nin the middle of our heat press then we're gonna take our adhesive sheet and\nwe are going to try to place it right in the middle of the transparent\none lastly we're going to put our teflon sheet\nand place the tray back inside of the heat press now we still have our timer\non our heat press set to 120 seconds and we're gonna be going for again 310\ndegrees fahrenheit all right so our heat press is done i'm\ngoing to take out the tray remove the teflon sheet\nand i'm going to peel now the trick is to do it at a consistent rate\nand non-stop and there you have it there's our\ncompleted transfer sheet all right so we're going to take our\nshirt and we're going to place it on the tray of the heat press\nright in the center or as best we can and\nwe are going to press the shirt for about 10 seconds just to remove any kind\nof moisture and wrinkles i'm gonna smooth out the\nt-shirt all right now before i place my transfer\nsheet on the actual t-shirt what i'm gonna do as an added precaution to make\nsure that i don't have any streaks of residue or anything like\nthat what i'm actually gonna do is just cut around my design\nall right so the next part is placing our design on our actual t-shirt\nand for the first time we're actually going to place the design with the\nglossy side up and the reason for this is because\nthe adhesive and the ink is actually on the matte side\non the bottom and that's the part that we want touching the shirt\nand now we're going to place it by measuring about four fingers from the\ncollar and we're going to try to put it in the\ncenter as best we can that looks about good i'm going to go\nahead and grab our teflon sheet i'm just going to place it above\nand we are going to press this at 310 degrees fahrenheit\nfor about 40 seconds so we're done pressing our shirt and\nremove the teflon sheet and we are going to take our shirt with\nthe design and we're going to place it to the side\nto cool down you want to wait about three to five minutes\nall right so it's been a few minutes so let's just go ahead and peel it now in\nmy opinion i think that this is the most satisfying part of the entire process perfect all right so now we're just\ngoing to finish off the process with another press at 310 degrees for\n20 seconds as always put your teflon sheet on top put the tray\nin the press and change my timer to 20 seconds\nand press we're gonna take out the tray peel the\nteflon and that's it there you have the finisher all right and that's it that's how you\ndo a heat transfer using the r550 printer\nand the heat press two-step transfer printing is an easy way to produce full\ncolor designs that can be transferred onto dark cotton tees\nlike this one you can also print designs on hard surfaces like mugs plates and\nbottles the ricoma r550 is the perfect printer for anyone looking to get into\nthe printing business or expand their current product line and if\nyou pair with one of ricoma's high quality heat presses\nyou'll stay ahead of your competition while reaching a wider customer base and\nkeep in mind that we do have this printer available for you to purchase at\nricoma.com so if you're interested click the link in the description below\nalso if you want to connect

so I thought it would be cool to do a few t-shirt or views alright so this is a first of a mini series that I'm gonna do for you where we're gonna take a look at some t-shirts we'll look at the knit quality the print quality you know the shirt the stitching you know yada yada yada we'll take a look at it I'll tell you what I think about it how it prints and such and I think I'm gonna try to take them home and wash them so that we can look that look at them you know before wash and post wash alright so today I have Hanes and I've got I believe the beefy T of course and a tag list a and I will put the product descriptions specifically you know for these two shirts by Hanes in the prom video description not the product description in the video description right below the video so you can open that up and that will tell you the exact two shirts we're looking at but one is the Hanes beefy T and the other is the Hanes tagless t so let's take a quick look at these shirts alright so I have my cheat sheets here so the Hanes beefy T is the 50 180 okay and the tag list T that I have here is the 50 to 50 okay these are Hanes products okay so the beefy t I've worked with this shirt before and you know the beefy T is actually a really it's a it's it's a pretty high-quality shirt it's very heavy the print surface is really nice I know that that you get some really nice prints on these because it has a tight knit and you know the only issue is that it's really heavy so for your customers that don't like that really really bulky heavy feel this is not the shirt for them you know what I'm saying I like the print surface of these shirts but I would never wear one of these myself because it's just way too thick and heavy for me but there are many people out there who love Jayne's BVT and it is a very well known product okay so I thought we would go ahead and do a test print on this one all right usually the stitching and everything on the Hanes beefy T is pretty spot-on now here the Hanes tagless T it's a six point one ounce you know just handling it it feels very good looks good print surface actually looks pretty good take a close look at it not bad the you know the we'll find out when we actually print on it really but it looks pretty pretty good print ability and looks like a decent shirt you know stitching doesn't look too bad once we get it on the palate we can see sometimes we can see how jacked up things are right so let's let's get these on the palate and do a couple prints I think I've got let's see what do we have three shirts here so I might do the spot color and the halftone design let's let's check let's take a look all right so hopefully this focus will work out and not like change I'm not sure this is the I think this is like first close up I'm trying with this camera or something I don't know so so this shirt is the beefy T Hanes beefy T I didn't even test print my screens but that's okay because I'm an old pro right yeah okay so yeah the Higgins beefy t ism ISM it is a really nice shirt it's very heavy and quite frankly it looks very well stitched the sample that I have here anyway take a look body looks nice and square even the collar looks pretty decent which usually is not the case all right so I think on this one will print the secret society logo what you see where the print is landing okay we're gonna pull this up a little bit for positioning it's just easier for me to do that right now okay that looks pretty good sorry about the screen going by there all right so hopefully this screen will print and not embarrass me in this video [Music] it's printing so let me get that decent okay I got a little piece of lint or something here oh actually I have a little something in the screen look here I don't know if you can see this there's just a little bit of ink that gummed up so let me grab a little screen opener it looks like there's something in my ink look a big like a horsefly that was in here the other day there was a giant horse fly in here and I bet he landed in my ink so let's see that's not bad I'm gonna um I'm gonna go ahead and give it another hit there and see something moving on I'm not sure everything's good take a look at this print might not be the greatest print well that helped out all right so that's not too bad I just saw a little loss of detail over here that I don't like for some reason that's probably because I may have not wiped it well enough but we're just looking at this so let's take a look let's throw it off onto the Belcher R that's a good good coverage no problem there alright so that a little bit kind of a halftone thing going on here let's see sorry I don't really keep my unit locked in that's not that what's giving a little more ink this this one you have to finesse a little bit more this is a like a 156 I believe and you want it with this design I like to get you know balance between coverage and you know not too much ink so that looks pretty good I think we'll go with that because we don't want this one to be thick all right so let's we'll cure these shirts and take a look at them oh of course don't forget I sell screen printing equipment and supplies cats fit screen print supply.com check it out if you have any questions give me a call or shoot me an email all right so this is the Hanes beefy T I'm not sure what you can see from this but you know I have a little I don't know there's a little bit of resolution loss over there that was probably because I had to do the screen opener and I liked it and I missed something there but um you know takes the ink very nice it has a very tight knit and this you know this shirt if you look at it through a loop it actually has a really tight knit seriously I'm not you know so it can it's probably a good prospect for high detail work but like I said again the feeling of the shirt when you wear it is very heavy it's thick it's very heavy weight sure in fact what is it if we look at the specs here well it's only a six point one you know so I would have thought it might have been a little heavier but it feels they all it almost feels like we're you know we're in a campus tent or something that's just my thought on it all right so all right so here's the Haynes tagless and printed very well it's nice how the knit is pretty fine as well I mean actually I'm kind of impressed with the tag lifts one I think it's actually pretty nice shirt the stitching is nice it's pretty heavyweight it is as well a six point one as we said I believe I should have my cheat sheet over here but I don't yeah six point one so you know this is also pretty heavy shirt I don't think it you know yeah it probably feels almost as heavy as the beefy tape but this might be an option you know against the beefy t possibly if you need this kind of heavy shirt but the stitching looks pretty good print surface looks great looks like a pretty high quality garment and I have printed these in the past so yeah I think they're pretty popular people like them let's look at the other prints alright so here's the Hanes tagless and once again I have to say actually kind of impressed it's really nice construction good stitching pretty cool print surface print looks really good nice and sharp this could be a good candidate as an alternative to the beefy t although it is you know 6.1 ounce as well but for some reason it doesn't feel quite as thick sometimes the way they knit them and even the dyes you know how much dye is in the shirt can make it feel kind of thicker you know like you can have a black and white shirt of the same exact model shirt right and the black will feel thicker and the reason is because the cotton is swelled from the dye so you know that's something to keep in mind with shirts all right so what I'm going to try to do now is I'm gonna take these shirts home tonight and I'm gonna wash them all right and then I'm gonna bring them back here tomorrow and I'll try them on a little bit I got them in my size so I could try them on and you know see how they feel and see how they wash so I will cut that portion of the video tomorrow and it'll probably have a different color value because it seems when I shoot in different sessions I get different looking video so you'll be able to tell all right so let's take these home throw them in the washer and see what happens okay so here's the final evaluation after washing all right so I washed them all inside out you know regular kind of laundry setting nothing gentle and you know this is the Hanes beefy T so you know I would say that you know the fabric definitely you know is a little bit more fuzzy than when it was unwashed so there is a potential for fibrillation possibly I would pay attention to your print surface when you're printing I did not because I was shooting a video so my print surface isn't the greatest but you know it does appear that there could be potential for fibrillation I think it you know would be wise to watch your print surface what it looks like when you're printing it and make sure that you're getting a nice smooth print but the Hanes beefy T is constructed very well heavy stitching it's pretty straight it loads on the pallet nice at least this sample did the collar was straight not really jacked up like they are most of the time so it's a pretty high quality shirt and I think the quality of print that you get on it really just depends on you alright so meaning that it's a good shirt to print on you you can get nice prints on it so here's the Payne's tagless and you know I have to say this one this one is a little bit different it's not as soft after washing like the beefy tee so this one may have a little bit less possibility for a favor elation although you know I washed them inside out all right so this is the one with the skull this type of one and again the stitching is pretty good everything looks really good went on the palate Strait collar looked straight stitching looked straight you know everything looked pretty well done so again a pretty heavy shirt seems well made and it appears you should be able to get a nice print off on that again you know you've got to pay attention to your print I don't make screen printing videos while you're trying to print somebody's work unless you're super awesome like I used to be but yeah once upon a time I might have been able to do that but these days anyway so yeah this one looks pretty good too yeah I think honestly I think the Hanes tagless tape probably has a little bit more durable surface I don't know how to say it it didn't get as fuzzy as the beefy tea after washing so that probably is a good thing but again very heavy type of shirt so if your customer doesn't like a heavy garment they still want something lighter like me personally these shirts are pretty heavy for me but uh let's try them on see how they fit okay all right so how's my mop do okay so this is the Hanes tagless like tried this one on cuz you know whatever I don't know um but it's I would say they run pretty small or tight cut okay I'm wearing a medium and it's pretty tight on me and if you go by the old rule of these sleeves they're starting to creep up my shoulder just slightly so this would be probably like if the trunk anymore it really wouldn't fit so I wouldn't be comfortable wearing this I want a large or something because it's too tight in the shoulders and under here okay so that's something to know sizing on shirts can be a big problem you know they're different brands and styles can be cut more generously than others so this one seems to be not very generous in the sizing so this is the Hanes beefy t this one is cut more precise perhaps I mean for me this fits a lot better I can move in the shoulders you know under the sleeve seams and stuff it's not too tight it's not cramping me up in there body is pretty good I ought to tell you the truth this one the Hanes beefy T in my opinion is more comfortable than the tagless T that I just tried so that's interesting I really didn't expect that because usually the beefy T is pretty stiff and bulky and heavy feeling you know what I'm saying but in my personal opinion this one is cut better and more comfortable to wear if that's possible but it is I guess the softer a little bit softer finished remember I said that I guess it's true it does you can really feel it Anya I think so it feels a little softer more comfortable as opposed to the Hanes tagless T so that's interesting alright so comfort can be an issue with customers as well if they just don't like the way the shirt fits or how it feels that's all I have for you today make sure to watch out for my other videos about t-shirt reviews we're going

Sawgrass SG 400 that's the sublimation printer I use now I've had people ask me if you could use a regular printer and you cannot I'll insert a picture of it somewhere in here so you guys can see which one I'm using I've got tons of videos on it so I've already printed out my design is ready to go the paper I use as Tex print are I'm going to be using my Cricut ten by twelve quick and easy press today for the design so we're gonna be using that and I'm gonna be using my 14 by 14 polka dot mat as well and then the shirts that I'm using these are the Gildan so when you first get them they look like this I'm gonna be doing the bleach method today and this is how they look when you first purchase them they are Gildan soft style ring-spun so they look just like this okay I'll have a link down below where i order my shirts I'm not affiliated anyway but they are super fast and that's just where I order them these are 65% polyester and 35% cotton as well as they are color you want to stick with like a light color a high polyester count so this is the ones that I'm using today they look like this when you first start out so you can put it on here and it will look super cute if you want to do what's popular right now and do the bleach method this is how they're going to look now I've done a video already showing you how to do this but I've actually changed the way that I'm bleaching these now so I actually don't even do it that way now so what I do and I'll just tell you really quickly and then I'll actually do an updated video very very soon so the way that I do this is I just put a hanger on it like normal I go and hang it outside on a tree like a small tree like a little branch you could be doing this um you can use like those those clothes racks that you get at Walmart that you know those little metal racks you could use those you could get them as cheap as like eight dollars I think 810 dollars so you get one of those clothes racks hang it on there so what I do is I have it on the hanger I hang it on a tree branch where I can reach it obviously and then I take a a bleach bottle like I did before and then I just lightly spray in this area and then I kind of spritz here and there just to get like these little spritz marks here I'll change the dial on my spritzer so it'll have a straight stream and then that's how I kind of get some of these spots like this so this is what the bottom of the t-shirt looks like just like this and then the top part where the design goes that's what a lot of people are doing just like this and then on the backside since it's hanging from the tree I'm not a lot of the bleach comes through there so it's just ro bite and then I took my spritzer and just kind of went like this with the sprays and that's how I came out with this really cool effect so it's super cute on the back love it but it's set out there I let it set out there and kind of dry just a little bit then I brought it inside now if you're doing a ton of these you don't have to do this stuff but this is what I did I brought it inside hung it up and then use my blow dryer to dry them really quick I like the ones with the attachments like this so where you have them on here so it gives it a nice string that's straight in my spot I always talk about that and then I just go you could use like a heat gun and stuff just don't get too too close so you're just gonna use your hairdryer I go over the whole shirt drying it really quickly and what that does is it intensifies the bleach and really helps bleach this out so I found it the best way and then when I'm done I take it over to my sink and I rinse it with cold cold water rinse rinse rinse rinse rinse until I know all the bleach is out I add just a little dot of the Dawn dishwashing detergent just a dot and then I just kind of wash it at my sink it's wet like this really well rinsing and washing and kind of carefully gently going like this until it's completely rinsed out there's no more soap bubbles and then I ring it and ring it ring it gently because I'm not want to get crazy just spots like this and I'm kind of pushing any water out like this as much as I can and then I just throw it the dryer just like that because it's clean I did the Dawn dish soap and everything so then I just throw it in the dryer with some towels or something and it's good to go that's how I'm doing mine like I said I will do an updated video very soon but I wanted to throw that out there just so you guys had that okay so let's get going so I've got my Cricut easy press on 350 for 60 seconds any taking my 14 by 14 mats I'm gonna get that down here you're gonna want to protect that surface with some butcher paper and then I'm gonna go ahead and get down my t-shirt get that up here like so take your lint roller and go over the entire shirt to make sure there's no lint especially if you put it in there with some towels probably bad but that's what I do so definitely go over it with a lint roller make sure you get off any lint and that's gonna avoid those little blue dots that you'll get okay so our t-shirts ready to go I'm gonna go ahead and pre-press it really fast to get out any moisture just like that so just pull down any moisture that was remaining and now we're ready to go so what I like to do is take my design here and I'm gonna fold it in half obviously it's not from the paper to paper it's right here so I'm gonna just I get it like this fold it in half where I can see my design I'm gonna line those up make sure my papers up here at the top make sure those are lined up and I'm gonna get a crease so that way I know where my Center is up go ahead and take my Cricut ruler that I've talked about before today I'm do it using these six by 26 looks good I've got it even up there at the top then I'm gonna go ahead and take my design we're gonna put it upside down I'm gonna line up that crease mark just getting that right up there at the top like so all right I'm gonna go ahead and take some heat transfer tape you can either get it from Amazon and rolls like this you can also get it from Cricut or you can pick it up at Michael's or Cricut calm I'll have it both of these linked down below so just gonna go ahead and give me some heat transfer tape like this and cut that down and I'm gonna get one on each side so I'm just gonna go ahead and get one here and one here all right so we're ready to go now that I've got this down all I'm gonna do is take a piece of butcher paper on top I will have this link below as well I buy the big rolls of this from heat press nation so now we're ready so we're gonna do is 350 for 60 seconds and you want to keep it as still as possible all right so very carefully we don't lift this up we're gonna go ahead and pull off our butcher paper all right so I'm going to go ahead and peel up our design just like that super cute don't worry about this right here so it looks like it burned the shirt so this will actually wash out whenever you go to do it I don't know what it is between this and the bleach I actually have it do this to me earlier and all I did was take it over to the sink just to double-check it would come out and it did so I took it over to the sink washed this out thing between the bleach and the press but like I said once I wash this it did come right out so don't worry about it at all so I'm gonna go ahead and go wash this really fast I'm gonna come back as soon as it's dry and show you guys that this is just gonna come right back out we wouldn't do that really quick and I will be right I am back so it felt seconds for you but it was about an hour or so for me so I washed the t-shirt and it completely came out I don't know why it does that I think it's some sort of chemical reaction with that bleach that it does it but it's not stained it will come out so if you guys do this where you bleach it first and then you put this on make sure you wash the t-shirt bleach it wash the t-shirt and then do it but even when you do that if it does that like I said it's some sort of chemical reaction but when you go wash this it's gonna completely come out what I do is I take it over to the sink again add a little bit of that Dawn dish soap and I brought the t-shirt together very carefully rubbing like this all the way around and then I wash wash wash in the sink wring it out and then I threw it back in the dryer now I probably could have just thrown this into the wash and it would have just done it on its own that way but since I was kind of quick for the video I did it that way so if you need to do it that way as well you can I just put a little bit darkness up like I said just one dog and then I moved it around the shirt and kind of wash while I was already wet and then just rinsed all the way around and like I said I don't know why it does that but it has to be some sort of chemical reaction now it's only gonna do that obviously if you bleach the shirt and then do it so if you do like we did before we use sublimate and then bleach the shirt you're not gonna have these issues at all you don't want to fuss with that I would definitely recommend that you go ahead and sublimate your t-shirt for first and then do the and then do the bleach because it's going to come out the same either way but you're not going to have to fuss with the extra steps of washing it again cute like I said I absolutely love the bleach effect this is what the back side of the t-shirt looks like it's super adorable I love it so I hope you guys enjoy this I hope you guys found it helpful if you did please hit the like button down below and subscribe and I'll see you on the next one", "zNqMyIIdACs": "I got long our pit here's me oh you're gonna go there and you're gonna go too what's going on everybody today we're gonna be going over various white tees and a bunch of different brands in pursuit of the perfect white tee if that's even possible to him I mean I've gone through so many different types of white tees from different stores different fits different prices alright so hopefully this video eliminates any future guessing games when it comes to the white tees you ready to talk about these men let's go [Music] all right team first whitey that we're gonna review is a classic white tea from pains man from what I remember when are these hain tea is growing up once you get them a little bit dirty you throw them in the washing a dryer they're done the color pretty much turns into like shrivel the bacon real ugly that's why the price is 5 for $20 like you cannot beat that price right there deals and after trying it on I'm gonna have to go and say the cotton is not that soft okay okay well what about the supreme one though okay that's another slavery the supreme one is for hypebeast aesthetics only wear Hanes I feel like they have a lot of brand recognition you know Payne's class or in Jordan it's a beautiful thing I put them up there with fruit of the Loom and whatnot but as far as the product itself I'm gonna have to go rate it at 5 how to change whatever you man the fit was a little bit off I'm gonna have to go and say solid because you do get five t-shirts for 20 if you just want to cover yourself up these are the ones that go ain't ease are definitely the ones that you wear to go to sleep in yeah generally not something robbed with a nice pair of denim definitely there's a go to safe bet go to sleep don't on your girlfriend type team your girlfriend okay alright so that wraps it up for the hangs white tee I think we could find something better I agree alright alright so next white team we got one from the rail department in North Sean I would say off the bat supersoft we already tell it is a lot better than the Hanes one you can tell right that with the price point to 430 that's not cheap at all that's kind of steep when it comes to a white tee but I'm thinking this is the one when you could wear not just to sleep so right off the bat looking at this white tee right here you could tell the fit is a little bit different the caller is a little bit more structured than the Hanes white to you that's definitely one thing when it comes to quality the white tee then I look at is the collar and you can't really see through the fabric like the Hays white so you can see I think you can foresee the problem if the nipples are Perkin the hanky is gonna show so after trying on this t-shirt I'm gonna have to go and say the fit is pretty good maybe like an 8 out of 10 okay it does feel pretty trendy the mid section is not too baggy it's not flowing all over the place overall when it comes to the rail white teeth I'm gonna compare to the Hanes you're gonna see this white seat hung up in my closet more I see what you mean cuz it hangs ones you're gonna play ball at the park with and then the rail t-shirts you're gonna you're clark's with alright so there we have it the rail department white team I would say worth checking out if you guys want a very soft nice fitting white team mover right along we got a pretty popular one that a lot of people get cuz it's so damn cheap we got forever 21 White T's for 4 bucks just feeling the Chi right now I wouldn't even call this con it has like slight like cardboard tight it leaves a little bit Scratchy let me tell you one thing just observing it before even touching it it does have a trendy look it does it almost reminds me of the real one that we just covered but it has the quality and the feel of the Hanes one well I mean that's what you're gonna get from a lot of forever21 products you're gonna get to look down but you're not gonna get the quality oh I've got these over the Hanes one the $4 so their dollar cheaper they look more expensive than they are I see what you mean I see what you mean but you know what am I I don't even put them in the same category the haze or whooping in the park tight white seat though on your girl like you said earlier this is more for like you want to hit the club and look trendy you know right but I don't put them in the same category so there we have it the forever 21 white tee you're gonna get that trendy look but you're not gonna get the quality down but for four dollars you don't really have a seat so next t-shirts we have up or from H&M and for a longest time I'd walk in there and be like why is there two white tees and two different prices one is a premium version it has like a slim fit you know a little bit thicker and kind and the one is just your regular plain $6.99 and white seat I'm not gonna lie I would get the ones out of 69 cuz they're cheaper and I really did not know the difference so for the ten dollar one this is called a crew neck t-shirt and then it also has a slim fit label on them I put this kind of in the category of like maybe that's all Bay white t-shirts you know what I mean like this fits a little bit tighter around the body and everything that leaves are super super short kind of like a euro fee okay I don't know you personally like it I can see what you're saying because the sleeves are kind of small the armpit of late is pretty short I got a long armpit hairs me you're gonna go down and stay away from this one man so I've always gravitated towards the $6.99 one I don't know why I decide the price point I just felt like wallet II was there for the price okay okay so everything on is not Dashie yes that's half the price of a regular screen print very true I do like these because I've always taught about a white tea could only be worn you know underneath the flan oh yeah well underneath a dress shirt but for some reason man I could wear this with a nice denim and they also have another section in H&M called the divided section they have really good white tees as well so also check those out they have a blue tag on them but as far as these white tees one thing I really never liked about the $6.99 ATGM White T's is the color is very wide do you like that I like it the blue chain shop I see fresh clear then ballers man they a not even a baby that's a newborn chain no it really is though this is how I categorize it man I think the big dudes you know the Johnny Simms and I in a weird way consider myself that big dude okay like I've been called a nugget before he's not sure people come in a nugget like a little stumpy so I'm gonna put myself in the category of your big news we like white tees with nice solid color collars I mean so for myself the hnny tees I never really liked them because of that reason I would definitely rate this one part of one of my favorites top three white tees I'd rate it solid nine out of ten I would put this over the rail or this one I just wanted to get this across that just cuz it's more expensive does not make it better from H&M it's not even gonna be the same thing as a cheaper one so you definitely got to try it on see what works for you so the slim fit white tees $9.99 I'm gonna have to say no go from H&M so last but not least we got the Stafford white tee right here you get four for 20 from JC Penney's if you would like and this is the type of color that I was saying that I like man meaning Johnny you know what I mean I really like this I don't like him at all I feel like this is oral Tim we need to rock the fitted over the ears yeah they arise with too much of the champs in footlocker for 420s men I already know off the bat quality is really good the quality is on point very thick you get a really husky collar right here best fit a little bit oversized when you do get them out the pack but these shrink really well after you shrink them okay pretty nice Stepford overall in general they have a lot of variations of their white keys this one is just their standard bit but they also got like the slim fit they also got some like cooling that one so definitely try out all the variations they have they don't all fit the same so overall wrapping up the Stafford white team I'm gonna have to go and say for myself okay as a small little nugget I like the Stafford white to nihilism right would you rate it are we gonna have to break this a nine out of ten there's no perfect white see out there idea no truth if you guys know what Earthlings signature is it's a brand from Costco and may have white team's very similar to this alright so there we have it the Stanford white tee not really for everybody but if you do want that feel of a street wear tight t-shirt go with the Stafford ones wrapping this one up tan what was your favorite white tee that we went over man I'm gonna have to go with the hmm for $6.99 for myself I like the Stafford white tees we get for 4/20 if you want that more like premium cotton feel but if you want more of like a trendy flow wear t-shirt I actually really like the ones from the rail department even though they were 15 bucks you definitely get that soft cotton feel alright so there we have it

peace", "2B4U--65K1w": "hello there and welcome back you know it's really hard to imagine but before the 1900s the all-american outfit of blue jeans and white t-shirt simply didn't exist as a matter of fact the t-shirt isn't nearly as old as at least I thought it was so hopefully you're gonna learn something here this is the history of the t-shirt all the brands that I mentioned today are listed and linked in the description below I'd really appreciate it if you use those links they help the channel they don't cost you anything and they allow me to keep making these videos for you so thank you in advance for using those from Dad's mowing their lawn to tie-dye wearing hippies to modern day street wear the t-shirt has reached legendary status you see if you lived in the 1800s chances are you wore a union suit for underwear it wasn't until later that people began to separate these one-piece suits into two separate garments with a longer upper half which could be tucked into trousers these shirts were widely used in the Navy but could only be worn by themselves in extremely hot environments and with express permission which allowed servicemen to keep their uniform shirt clean while working so of course when military men came home from war they brought their t-shirts with them and they made their way into regular civilian life mostly worn as underwear or while performing manual labor and the word t-shirt was added to the Webster dictionary in 1920 during the Great Depression the t-shirt was an inexpensive option which allowed men not to work bare chested but could still work comfortably in fact one of the earliest appearances of the t-shirt in film is in the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz where the workers are stuffing the Scarecrow with new straw at the Emerald City now I never imagined that Marlon Brando would make his way into two history videos first the Shah perfecto and now the t-shirt but in 1947 a streetcar named desire hit Broadway featuring marlon brando dressed in a plain white t-shirt and Levi's 501s and at the time you have to remember that this is almost like him acting in his underwear since t-shirts were essentially underwear and later in 1955 James Dean rocked a white t-shirt in rebel without a cause so here you have two very popular figures of course it's gonna catch on with youth so by the 1960s the t-shirt had become extremely popular with teens so bands and companies were quick to plaster their logos on them creating walking boards but screen-printed teas can actually be seen as early as the 1940s when the cover of Life magazine featured an Air Corps gunnery school t-shirt but then again why wouldn't the t-shirt be popular it's inexpensive to make and by launders easily and works great alone in the heat or as a layer in the cold so here we are in the modern day and the choices and t-shirts may surprise you there are a ton of different varieties build qualities and of course prices to match so I've broken them down for you into three categories at the bottom level of course you have the multi pack style through the loom teas made of scratchy cotton in some country with cheap labor these are what I'm used to and most men probably think of when they think of a white t-shirt most t-shirts at this level use cheap cotton known as upland cotton which is a short staple variety also known as Mexican cotton it typically has an uneven and somewhat rough texture but can be blended with other materials to soften it up a bit some of the brands from this first tier include names that you've known since you were a kid like Hanes and Fruit of the Loom but I've had really good luck with some of the Gap t-shirts they're actually really stretchy really comfortable for a decent price stepping up in quality costs a bit more but you get a much better product longer staple cotton tube knits and nicer seams so look for a supima cotton which is the American version of pima cotton which is about 50% longer than most cotton varieties which is basically meaning a softer fabric Egyptian cotton is another fantastic option with its thin soft fibers also known as extra-long staple cotton these tees will also be made in countries with high standards of manufacturing like Japan Germany or the USA and will often be knit on a circular knitting machine this is the same process that used to make socks so it delivers a t-shirt without side seams some of the brands to look for in this mid tier include flint and tinder and they're slub pocket tee they're supima air knit tee tailor stitches heavy bag tee Knickerbocker Velva Sheen or lady white another brand that I really like it this mid tier is armored luxe with their striped tees now you've probably seen these worn by Picasso and James Dean they go for about 60 bucks but they're soo cool finally there is the creme de la creme which most people will call you crazy for buying but if you want the absolute best and prices no object well then this is for you you'll find fabrics that are finer thicker blended with fibers of silk or wool basically the options are limitless for the right price along with the finest stitching and seams you'll often find these tees made using loop wheel machines this is a very slow and inefficient process but results in a very soft and dense fabric without side seams again the way sweatshirts were actually made in the early 1900's some of the tees at this final price point include the real McCoys samurai loop and weft and sun spell so guys obviously there is a t-shirt for pretty much everybody but of course I want to know what you think are you one of the people who will only buy the multi pack Fruit of the Loom style because it's mostly worn as underwear or would you go for the mid to upper tier shirts which you can wear on their own and kind of you appreciate the artisanal qualities that go into making them I really want know what you think because I think's good doesn't really divide people some people gonna be like you're insane for spending thirty five dollars in a t-shirt look I can get twelve for like ten bucks and other people will say no I but take a look at how much nicer this is and and it's something that to be honest with you I only really own the mid-tier I have a really hard time spending anything more than like thirty five bucks for a t-shirt but I'd like to just to see what it's like so that's kind of where I stand and I'd really be interested to hear your thoughts please let me know in the comments below until next time thank you so much for watching I really do appreciate it and I'll see you next time if you're watching this far that means that you want more content and I have no more to give you in this video but there are many many other videos that I've made

[Music] uh [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] hey guys so we got our black and white spiral single single wall color spiral don't have any clue what it's going to look like because it bled a little bit the thick water must not have gotten down all the way so that's my bad for not pushing the cuticle pusher further but we're gonna try it all right black and white ooh all right so the black did bleed quite a bit however i think that looks pretty cool it kind of looks marbly so we're gonna put this in the sink with dawn dish soap and warm water warm enough that you can put your hand in it not too hot though otherwise you're not going to want to put your hand in there but you got to change it after a half hour do it again until there is no more dye in it and hopefully the white will stay white and the thumbnail is the washed and dried version of this and i like it so thanks for watching", "lLILkojt_z4": "if you were curious about the Gildan soft style geez 64,000 like this one right here then this video is for you there are a ton of blank t-shirt options out there to choose from so many that stand has this permanent look on his face but not to fear because today we're just gonna look at one in specific the Gildan soft style G 64,000 there are a few important things to consider when trying to choose which t-shirt is right for you comfort style color options and price and also since we are a screen print shop we're actually going to talk about the print ability using discharge and water-based inks which is what we specialize in here at Twin Cities first let's start with comfort this shirt is a hundred percent ring-spun cotton and it weighs 4.5 ounces what this means is that through the ring spun process they've left it with longer stronger strands of yarn what it means for you and I is that this shirt is soft and it's durable shirt was made for wear it's a softer shirt than your Gildan G 5000 your standard heavy cotton t-shirt but not quite as soft as like your next level 3600 your Bella canvas 3000 won American Apparel 2001 those shirts are combed ring spun cotton so they're gonna be a little bit softer but this shirt is a nice middle-of-the-road comfortable shirt next let's talk about styling it's not a Corvette but it's also not your grandma's beige Buick LeSabre out here this shirt is a semi fitted with a tape neck and shoulders it has a rolled forward shoulder so it fits most body types really comfortably it has a nice seamless double collar a durable sleeve and him double needle stitch it is a little longer than your standard t-shirt but not as long as something like the next level 3600 and this shirt comes in sizes extra small through Forex as for shirt colors Gildan always has a lot of color options and this shirt is no different it has a ton of different options to choose from if you look at these charts you'll see that they mix the heather colors and things with it as for price once again nice mill the road shirt as Goldilocks would say it's not too cheap it's not too expensive it's just right and to give you an idea here is a price list this price is 450 shirts with a1 color print and as you can see it fits right in between like the cheaper Gildan 5 thousands and the more expensive fitted shirts like next level labelled the canvas american apparel things like that so this price is really just to give you an idea where this shirt fits among a bunch of our other popular t-shirt options and remember that these prices are subject to change since the time you've seen this video so next let's talk a little bit about actually printing on the Gildan soft style t-shirt since we use discharge inks the dye lot of the shirt actually is very important and what a dialogue is is where they actually take a blank material and they diet to give it its color so in some places like here's an example of a bad dialogue where we print discharge ink on it and we get varying results luckily Gildan has been very consistent with their dialogues we've seen a little bit of problems lately but not too much the important thing is as a customer it's not really that important to you guys because it's up to us to printers to figure out the dialogue problems and it just makes a little extra work for us but for you just so you know the Gildan soft style t-shirt has always been a good option their colors always come out really nice and really consistent one more thing to add the Gildan soft shirt also comes in a ladies version that's the G 64,000 L let me just throw that on for you real quick so you can see what it looks like so once again the Gildan soft style is a very middle-of-the-road shirt it's not fitted so it's not going to make you feel insecure staying here has no shame and it's not a boxy shirt that's gonna make you feel like a square it's right down the middle and now there's only one thing left for you to do and that's to click on the link in the description below fill out the quote form let us know you want the Gildan soft style t-shirt if that is indeed that shirt you want and before you know it you'll have t-shirts of your own we talked about a lot of different terms in this video we talked about ring spun cotton and if you want to learn more about the differences between types of cotton and what those terms mean then click in this video here because I go into detail about those different things and on that note we'll see you in the next video", "5hzhyMvVNxQ": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel today we're gonna be talking about different white t-shirts I know talking about this sounds like I'm talking about different kinds of water water like it's the same thing but it's not so we're gonna look into it I have a few to show you guys we're gonna be comparing the prices the quality and the fit we're gonna be talking about five different ones today and the first one we're gonna be talking about is from Target now this one is only five dollas so super affordable but then when you put it on there it looks like $5 a fabric is pretty shia so you can kind of see what you may not want to see I don't really mind the fit of the t-shirt the sleeve length is good it's not too short because I don't like any sleeves that I like cat sleeves are like here because I just I just don't like sleeves at that short I got a medium in this and it sits on the body or right but because the fabric is so thin it makes it kind of drapey but not in a good way so that's a target one it's not something I would wear it out it's more like a stay-home netflix and chill' kind of t-shirt so if you need an at-home t-shirt then maybe you can consider this one next up with H&M and I chose the loose fit one which was 14.99 the only thing is they ran out of my size so they only had extra-large left but I bought it anyway so I can show you guys before you see the next clip I'll just let you know the t-shirt is very oversized on me it's like pretty much like a dress but I actually really like the way it sits on the body the t-shirt is a lot more structured the fiber is a lot thicker and more opaque than the target one it seems like a heavy weight cotton so it sits on the body a bit nicer the width of the collar is good and I really like the length of the sleeves even though this is an extra lash I know you can't really tell how it would fit because that's obviously not my size the one thing I have to say though that compared to all the other t-shirts right off the bat you can tell that this t-shirt is not completely white it's sort of like a cool turn blue why if that makes any sense me that makes you look a little bit cheaper because it's not a pure white but if you don't mind that then I think the fit of this is really good if you're after a more boxy oversize fit you might really like this and because I want to see how the medium of knit I got it in this different colorway which is kind of like a grey not quite black kind of color and I actually really really like this one if you're going for the Calabasas caption collection look then maybe you can give this a go it fit me really well it's a nice oversize but not overly oversized the sleeve leg is pretty long so you maybe look out for that if you don't like these that way too long but for me that is ideal it comes down to my elbows and the length of t-shirt is good as well even though it's service iced it doesn't seem like so long that it would be a dress on me so big thumbs up for the H&M one but not in the white one when I think of wardrobe basics the first thing that I think of is Uniqlo because I really really love majority of their things I think their quality is good and they have a really good price point so of course I had to get a t-shirt from them I got the one that was $19.99 but it wasn't sale for $14.99 but again with the color of this t-shirt it is not a true white it's more of a creamy kind of white the cotton is very soft on this one but it is also not very opaque so it's slightly sheared but not as bad as a target one so you will kind of see what's underneath but not really maybe if you look really hot in my neighborhood not that you want to okay because the fabric is a lot softer again it sort of sits on the body differently and it's more drapey in a way the width of the collar is good it's not super thin I don't like really thin collars that's a weak call I don't I don't like a weak collar the length of the sleeve is slightly shorter than the previous two but again not overly short that I wouldn't want to wear it so I think overall the Uniqlo one is good the only thing I don't like about it is the color is not a true white this next teaser I'm going to be talking about is a favorite amongst a lot of the guys I know so this is highly recommend by a few people and it is from AAS color it is the classic T in the heavyweight cotton and it's $24 now I have to agree with the guys I like a lot of aspects of the t-shirt so the fabric is really nice and thick so it's really okay it has a nice thick color the sleeve length is good which is just above your elbow also it is a true white t-shirt so there's no like of white white kind of color is actually a true white it makes you look really clean and really nice but the thing I don't like is that the length is really long compared to all the other t-shirts and also the midsection seems to be a lot slimmer so when I wear is sort of doesn't fit loosely it hugs on to my hips which is not the look I'm going for but if you are someone who tucks into a t-shirt then this shouldn't be an issue it will look very good everywhere else - if you were not to tuck it in or if you are really slim person I don't think what effect you is just I think it's me cuz my trying it awesome I don't like this like midsection area so the kind of this is not overly boxy like the H&M one but it's a lot more structured compared to uni glow and target so overall I think the S color one is it's pretty good so the guys knew what they were talking about and it is something I recommend having said that there I don't know if a skull is just available in Australia but yeah I'll look it up if I can't find a link I'll link it in the description box below last but not least I had to include a Bruschi option and it is from acne studios it is $135 pretty steep for plain white t-shirt first impression wise you can tell the quality is a lot higher than all the other tshis the fabric is a lot more refined and the way it is constructed so in terms of the stitching you can tell it's a better quality is it worth 135 dollars there I don't think sir it does sit on the body quite nicely this t-shirt doesn't have a lot of structure because the fabric is quite soft so it's more like a drapey kind of t-shirt I think this one fits a little bit small because I got mine in a lodge and it like a medium and the rest of the t-shirts or maybe that's something you can think about the length of the sleeve is okay but it is shorter than the ass color one this one has a slightly thinner color and it also doesn't sit too close to your neck so if you like that you might like this t-shirt but I don't think it's something that you need to run out and go buy because it is pretty expensive for what it is the one thing that I think this is good for is that if you do outfit grits you do you guys know what I'll figure to try elect on the Grand Isle picker it's like this then I think it would look cool because you can see the acne Studios label on it but other than that it's a nice t-shirt but I don't think it's something that I would recommend buy unless you feel like splurging on yourself and you want to buy a nice t-shirt then yeah definitely go for it but it's not a necessity in your wardrobe for sure overall I think that thinks I like about each t-shirt what I don't like about them if I had to pick the best out of the five that I reviewed I would say this is really hot I would say that is color if I planned on tucking in my shirt if not I would go for the hmm but again it's not completely white this is so difficult I can't even pick and I'm making this video for you guys it really depends on what you're after if you're after something with a box you're set if you like something that's longer then you go for the S color but yeah I hope this video is helpful for you guys and if you have a favorite white tee please leave it in the comments below and let me know if you enjoyed this video don't forget to give it a big thumbs up and subscribe to my channel if you haven't ready and I'll see you guys really really soon bye last but not least I had to include a bruise eruption from H hmm no heart", "z_WOurQ09do": "what is up guys welcome back to another video right so today we've got a t-shirts video the best fitting t-shirts for you guys in 2020 i've got loads of brands to go through we've got raffle we've got adidas we've got lyla and scott all saints uniqlo asos all the brands so which is the best fitting t-shirt for 2020. it's going to be interesting to find out because so many t-shirts out there that are awful and all these ones are going to be decent it's just going to come down to which one is the best value which one is the best quality and which one is the best psych style you know i mean so let's get straight into the video but before we do don't forget to drop this video a like subscribe to the channel if you've not already and all the t-shirts are going to be linked in the description down below as well so go and have a look down there if you do like any of these t-shirts all right let's start with the first one so the first t-shirt we've got is from uniqlo you can't go wrong with uniqlo you guys it said in my last t-shirts video where's the uniqlo to you as uniqlo like i had to get it involved for this one so this is the supima cotton t 995 very affordable i think it's the second cheapest hair out of all the bunch but very decent fit it's not too tight it's not too loose the material actually does feel quite nice and soft as well if there's one complaint it could be a little bit tighter around the arms like there's quite a little bit of excess material just flopping about there but to be honest for 9.95 you can't fault it at all it's really nice fit and they've got loads of different colors on the website as well they've actually got a v-neck option as well so if you prefer v-necks that could be the one for you but yeah decent start let's move on to the second one the second t-shirt we've got guys is from asos this is the cheapest one of all the t-shirts in this video eight pounds an absolute bargain so this is just like an organic tea i've actually gone for a size extra large in this because you guys know that the sizes do run quite small in asos when it comes to t-shirts and shirts and stuff so really nice but a little bit more boxy than the uniqlo one i'd probably say the uniqlo seat is a better fit than this and the material probably is slightly better but then again if you want something really versatile you've got loads of different colors on the website as well and asos shipping and delivery is by far the best so that is one reason why you could sway to them but still a really nice t-shirt really affordable let's move on to the third one next up guys we've got a t-shirt from all saints so in the comments of my old saints video i've got so much stick saying that it wasn't good quality but i think it just depends what sort of guy you are if you like thinner materials then all saints is really good but i prefer my materials and t-shirts to be a bit thicker so that's why i wasn't a huge fan however i do really like this t-shirt so i've got a size up i'm a size extra large in this t-shirt if you're more of like a skinny guy or you really like a tighter fit like a muscle fit then i definitely recommend all saints so again mid-range i think this is 29 pounds it's t-shirt it's a really nice fit feels really good quality to be honest like the length is spot on and it fits really well definitely a very nice fit if you're more into like the fitted physique look but yeah very decent and the minimal branding just on the left chest there the fourth t-shirt we've got guys is from sulfit clothing and this is actually part of the new releases which have just launched today so we've got this ocean blue t-shirt we've also got it in neo mint but this is one of the essential minimal teas i'm a big fan of this so i've designed the t-shirt to be more or less the perfect fit not too tight not too loose a good enough length through the body and i think it is spot on an absolute bargain as well at only 12 pounds so if you want to grab one of these guys it's going to be linked in the description go and have a look down there we've got loads of different colors as well so go and get involved but perfect on the arms i'm wearing a size large here really good length as well not too long and if you think it is too long like after the first wash it will shrink a little bit but only in the length so that will be perfect that's how i've designed it to shrink a little bit in the wash but we've got the minimal branding just on the left chest here really nice color like i said they've just launched so go and check them out guys but let's move on to the next t-shirt we've got four left and i'll conclude on which one i think is the best fitting t-shirt so you've gone from one of the cheapest to the most expensive i couldn't do this video without featuring ralph lauren so we've got the trademark minimal logo just on the left chest here i do recommend sizing up if you are going to get one of the ralph lauren t-shirts as well because i got a size large and it was just too small for me so this is a size extra large the fit is bang on nice and fitted through the arms and through the chest the shoulders but then again not too tight through the body around here very big fan of this it just depends on if you want to spend a little bit more money so the unique one is 10 pounds this is like 45 it's quite a big difference like 4.5 times the amount but then again it is ralph lauren so you cannot expect that price jumps very nice very ideal so guys before we move on to the next t-shirt i just want to talk about today's video sponsor rose gold on black so the best men's accessories in the game really minimal really simplistic they're going to go with so many different outfits like if you're wearing this t-shirt with a nice pair of jeans some nice trainers a nice denim jacket over the top maybe or a bomber jacket really minimal and simple accessories like this are gonna match really well with it i think this minimal beaded bracelet is probably one of my favorite pieces they've actually got along with the bar necklace because it's so small and so thin i think it just looks really good in it it's not too clunky and it's not too big and in your face so if you want to go and check them out guys there's going to be a link right at the top of the description go and get involved you get 20 off and then if you use my code josh sull you get an extra 10 off on top of that which is a very nice touch ball the best men's accessories in the game and they're not too expensive either and you're gonna pair them with loads of different outfits as well so go and get involved go and give them a try the adidas essential tea 25 pounds so we're kind of in that mid-range budget it's quite nice but you know if you're more into like you're oversized or you want the t-shirt to be a bit thicker then i would definitely recommend this one i'm on a size large but it is quite big on me so it does come past my shoulders a little bit and it is longer in the arms and a little bit baggier so kind of it just kind of ranges from what your style is like if you're more of an all saints guy and you want it to be tighter and definitely go for that one but if you want it to be a bit bigger not as tight on the body a bit loose a bit boxier and this adidas one is very ideal not bad at all just got the minimal branding on the left chest as well which is a nice touch yeah i do quite like this one it's quite long in length so maybe just bear that in mind if you're a shorter guy maybe go for a different t-shirt so guys i've actually never tried on a vans t-shirt before but i thought i'd give it a whirl you know what it's actually quite nice you guys know i absolutely love this color it's like the same color as my new car it's very nice the fit is very similar to the adidas one so it's a little bit looser on the arms you've got a bit more room to play with here which you can kind of understand because it's a bit of a skater brand isn't it and they're not going for like a slim muscle fit but yeah it's quite a nice t-shirt again the length is quite long as well so if you're a shorter guy maybe bear that in mind but overall not a bad t not bad so the final t-shirt we have got guys is from lylan scott this is definitely a lot more of a tighter fit than the previous two it's a lot tighter than the adidas and the vans t-shirt are more fitted like sleeves are shorter a bit tighter as well but i kind of like this fit this is probably the ideal fit for me so it's not too long in the body either it comes just above the pocket which is nice a really nice color isn't it the only thing i'm not a huge fan of is the gold logo i think it does look a little bit tacky just a little bit but i think the fitting the quality of the t-shirt for the price is not bad at all to conclude then guys all of them are pretty nice t-shirts it just depends on what your style is so if you prefer one to be a bit boxy and not as tight then i would definitely recommend going for the adidas or the vans one they're both very similar priced as well both very nice maybe adidas edges it a little bit just for the quality of the material and if you want to be slimmer muscle fit then the all saints one is very ideal very nice quality materials a little bit thinner which is decent for you guys who like like it tighter you know you don't need to be too thick do you but guys overall my top three t-shirts from this video if you are gonna buy one in third place i'd say uniqlo uniqlo is very good value for money 9.95 there's loads of different colors to choose from it's a very nice fit and very minimal and basic you can pair it with loads of different outfits and stuff like that number two the value is not the best but i think for the brand for the quality you're getting it's very ideal it's ralph lauren so there's loads of different colors you can choose from there as well and the quality and the brand itself is um is it it's just a go-to isn't it it's a really nice quality t-shirt with the minimal branding just on here and number one i think you know what i'm gonna say but i have to be true to my word i have to be true to my own colours i'm gonna have to say the sulfate clothing one i've designed it myself it's perfect for any occasion there's loads of different colors you can choose from again it's a nice length it's not too tight but then again it's not too baggy as well it's like the perfect fit so if you want to go and check it out guys it's going to be linked in the description 12 pounds and two new colors i've just gone live today neomin and ocean blue so go and have a look there like i mean i've been i've tried on hundreds of t-shirts over the past years and the whole point of me doing sulfate clothing is to try and improve the fit of other brands and bring the good quality for a good value for you guys as well so if you don't like this stuff return it to me i'll definitely refund

and have a look down there but that is it from me today guys take care see you later catch you on the next one [Music]", "D7FqwkG8I10": "what's up guys Lucia Lumina here and in today's video I am going to be sublimating on three different types of shirts so today I have the Cricut and fusible ink t-shirts that they sell at Michaels and you probably can find these Michaels certain Walmart's Hobby Lobby Joanne's all those type of hobby or craft shops and these guys are 95% polyester and 5% I believe nylon or something like diet or spandex 5% spandex and cricket markets this as its infusible inc brand I'll see the camera can kind of focus on that right there but really they sell like their own patterns and be able to cut it with the Cricut and kind of you know print similar to what this guy has well lucky for us we have an actual sublimation printer that will print whatever we want on this guy so the other two type of shirts I was trying to find a 50/50 poly cotton but I couldn't find one anymore like locally so I ended up grabbing a to Walmart shirts but their one was is for women and one for men and one of them is a time and true brand you can see think that sir the woman brand that they have and this guy is and I'll show you guys here it is a 60% cotton and 40% recycled polyester and you guys can see the tag there so you see it so we're gonna be using this guy we're gonna see how a subliminal print comes out on this and then I also got a George brand I say and and this is actually shirts that I use very often with HCV and and heat transfers I actually like the George Brown how the shirts kind of feel and they're very easy to access at least during the summer and spring times and even fall a winter you kind of see this long-sleeve version of these t-shirts but for the most part they're pretty easy to find and this guy is 65% polyester and 35% cotton you can kind of see so we have three different levels of polyester in the shirt and while I kind of know you know I think the minimum should be 50/50 poly cotton this one probably would work this is just kind of my I guess assumptions or or my theory I don't think this one's gonna do too well but this one for sure should sublimate very very good and I actually found these for sale at Michaels 50% off so if you guys actually follow me on my Instagram at Lumina creative I typically post about cells like this so these guys like I said were 50% off so $10 typically at Michaels they were 5 bucks guys is this cheaper than what I can get them like on some t-shirt websites I can be trying to get a hundred percent polyester so it was a really good deal I picked up a bunch of these because I have a huge order and then like I said follow my Instagram and I always pull stuff like this so yeah guys I am gonna get my designer here real quick I'm not really gonna show that if you want to see the process of doing that you can watch my previous video up here that kind of shows you the introduction of sublimation how I set up a image of that nature but I'm gonna go ahead and set up the image and then I'm gonna go ahead and print it and I'm gonna get the heat press ready I guess for so far the settings on the heat press you're gonna do 400 degrees Fahrenheit so if your machine is in Celsius like mine that's gonna be 200 and 204 degrees I definitely recommend having a little legs are going to kind of check the temperature of your heat press at all times because mine is a little off sometimes and you're gonna set your timer at 45 to 60 seconds try to play with the timer typically black ink if your image has a lot of black ink that takes a little bit longer to sublimate as simply the last color that kind of transfers over and again guys if you guys are only a little more about sublimation of the process check out that video I did a few weeks ago but anyways let me go ahead and get to it I'm gonna print and then we'll switch over to the camera over here on the heat press alright guys so I just ran my test print I always suggest you guys to run with your sublimation printer in case you don't use it on the daily like I do like I said I'm more of a few chunks of plaster so heat transfer user and HCV and so I just kind of ran one real quick it's kinda what the delenn's gonna be similar to the one I do with the Neenah 3G opaque when I did a print and cut except I added my domain at the bottom so we're gonna sublimate this guy this is just a regular eight and a half by eleven sheet guys so I'm gonna go ahead and start running the actual one and let's see how it comes out guys I cannot stress this enough I printed these guys wrong so what sublimation always always always always remember mirror your image I just wasted a bunch of ink on three prints that were supposed to be reversed learn from my mistakes guys I got a reprint them let's go alright guys so we are back so I already kind of pre-press this one right here now you're supposed to put something in here and I don't know where 1/2 will happen to my little board I like a little plastic thing that I put underneath so I'm gonna slide our old of use quick and Matt underneath here and just because I don't have my actual thing that I use but I guess this works too right and what this is guys is with sublimation sometimes the the transfer will go a little bit too far or like the it'll go through so you can do this so that that doesn't happen to you this shirts a v-neck so I'm gonna put it up a little higher so this first shirt is the time ensure I'm so sorry the lighting sucks I'm not this is not I intended to do Hey oh cool so one of the transfers now it is a mirrored rookie mistakes guys I'm not gonna measure I'm not gonna try to get this perfect this is literally just to see if it'll sublimate on to the shirt just want to see if it'll work these are just test prints so we're gonna go ahead and press those guys let's see how this goes I guess we're gonna take this one off I'm not gonna show you how everything looks till the end so ye alrighty guys we're gonna go ahead and put the next shirt in which is the George brand and this one is 6535 so we're gonna go ahead and put this guy on [Music] that we transfer same thing guys same process and you'll put it on here slap this narek there you know we're gonna go to town I think that's pretty close to being Center so yeah sorry guys so same thing lift up don't breathe in remember you're supposed to be doing this in a regulated area alrighty guys so last shirt gonna throw on the and this is the cricket one notice every shirt gets bigger and bigger I start from small medium and now extra-large these old cricket Matt's work just fine for this but they do kind of melt so you got to wait a little bit before you take them out and it'll harden up again and take shape so anyways you're gonna impress these get the wrinkles out and the moisture I'm gonna go ahead and do the last print guys Center that like so [Music] again I'm not doing this 100% accurate I'm just kind of eyeballing to see the quality of these prints not necessarily use these shirts for anything [Music] same think I'm breathe alright guys so I know it looks like anyone from day to night I kind of started this little delayed afternoon where there's a little bit of sunlight it's kind of gone down her those prints took a little while to do especially because I could do it twice because my dumb self decided to do them not mirrored again guys learn from my mistakes and I am not ashamed to show you that I to make these type of mistakes three perfectly good sublimation sheets gone to waste including ink don't be like me just see you see these are the ones I used they are mirrored so to you look straight to me here on the camera whether they have been all used and let's see the final results guys I just don't want you guys to see that not because something shouldn't be done doesn't mean just because some people say it shouldn't be done doesn't mean you can't do it there's a bunch of different ways to do things and and you know what guys every customer is different you might get a customer that wants the least expensive route that wants to just as long as the image is somewhat visible they don't care and you know for those type of customers one of these options are going to be great for the customers I want the higher end stuff one of these options is gonna be good too and so like I tell people that comment on my videos because I do get some people are like I bet you if you watch that nina 3g up a paper is gonna fall right off or I bit because it's not pigment in ink it's gonna fall right off after water too and you know what guys I get it it's hard to believe it when you don't do it yourself but if you follow some of these instructions that I'm giving you step-by-step you're gonna get the same results I do and you know the this is stuff that people say shouldn't work on and so I'm gonna show you guys the three results from three sharps and you tell me what you think and which route would you go through would you go for would you offer all these three to your customers we're joining off for one comment in the section below and tell me what are your thoughts so anyways let me grab these shirts so you can kind of take a look already so we're gonna start with the shirt that I thought just wasn't gonna sublimate and that's the time and true brand from Walmart and the reason why I use these specifically showed you guys is because you can go purchase these at your local stores this is not something you have to order from someone these shirts are not something that you have to go find in the internet it's literally available to anybody and at ridiculous prices so this time and shoe came in and think I had four dollars for a shirt and guys honestly if you don't have an account somewhere or like a wholesale account that's a pretty good fish good price for a shirt especially something you can sublimate on so this is the type of shoe brand guys and I'll see if I can ladies all out at the end and you know comparison like I actually do like a panning of them but this is what that shirt looks like and again this was if I am correct 65% cotton about 60% pima cotton and a forty percent recycled polyester so I mean here I know the camera is a little difficult to see but it's definitely a little a little faded type of look it's not it's not a super super sharp image but it works guys some people might have customers that don't mind this you know and this is why you have a few samples laying around will show your your customers and you know for somebody's gonna get these dirty and they're just you know for advanced or for something that's like a one-off use why not why am i go with the least expensive option so anyways let's switch over to the George brand and I try to do a female and a male brand so that's like yeah yeah you know I can't find it for one the other Bailey's this is the George Brown guys right here and this is 65% polyester 35% cotton a little more vibrant you can definitely see a little more details in the print looks good like I said Walmart Walmart Walmart Walmart Walmart I like most of my shirts that I saw the people at one work I use Gildan Walmart and then I want to go to step up like a little bit better quality I go to next level or Bella canvas which Bella canvas is actually now available at michaels if you don't have a whole slit account alright so last shirt okay and this is the cricut brand and fusible ink and I got these guys on sale I got that for style Michaels and they do go I'm sorry once in a blue moon and these these are typically $10 a piece which is a little more expensive than the order from a website or something typically the polyester 100% of like seven dollars or maybe a little less I know you guys probably some of you guys probably have a better host account than I do but for me it's seven dollars for polyester shirt and I found these guys for five bucks guys so I actually bought almost a whole inventory because I had a very large order fulfill but this is how the Cricut this is 95% polyester and 5% spandex guys it is so vibrant like it is sharp it is clean check that out it is a very nice quality image very little bleeding you can specifically tell in the text very little bleeding very clean image and this might be for those customers that don't mind spending a little bit extra you go with the 95% cotton again you can probably find this stuff cheaper online guys but I'm trying to give you a solution to be able to do this stuff from home and if you get like a random customer that pops up and you need a quote quick and they need something turnaround for next day either way you're gonna charge them a premium this is the cost you gotta pay they gotta pay in store prices if not they can wait like everybody else and you can order and get your discounted rates okay so this is what it looks like after a wash and this is the more cotton one the yeah the tiny children and so she watched this one time already so I'm kind of trying to get a little close a little bit looks a little bit like that worn effect but guys like I said it looks good and I printed well the heat didn't fall off you know obviously I don't know we might give it a few more wash tests and see what they come out like the cricket one looks awesome we washed all three of them together and this is the cricket one pretty much the same nice and vibrant looks great so tell ten guys thank you

see y'all on the next video [Music] you", "YBNjhuVgYFM": "what's up just Ali and as you know I am starting my own t-shirt company line merch whatever you want to call it caught my visual interpretation let's go ahead and get into what type of shirts of that boss so I am going through what's their name TSE apparel so I'm going through a wholesale company called TSE apparel and today I picked up some sample and I can already tell the difference in qual one of them's like a hashey black that's the Gildan and I don't appreciate that I'm gonna have my customers putting a lotion on their shirts I'm about to show y'all in one second we lay about let me lay them out for ya let me lay them out for ya okay so you can see the variations in the and black pusher turn the soft light off that back light you can definitely see the variations you've got Gildan you've got Bella canvas right here Bella canvas and then I also picked up a home brand Toltecs and as of right now just looking down I like these two better already out the gate because you can just tell the quality from looking at the shirts that you know they took their time they took the time this one this one's actually this is definitely going to be or I shouldn't even say a she is just it's just a different black a black that I can't appreciate right now um and what I'm going for with my brand is you know quality products because I can't be giving out no uh no lame stuff but off the camera this one is definitely darker this it goes darker this one and then this one but let me show you how they feel trying all Gildan first so trying on this shirt first I mean it's okay now I have no complaints as of right now it feels it feels fine I feel like maybe it might be a little bit each year but I mean it's not bad whatsoever it's not bad at all it feels good it's not riding up my arms I can it's good like me I mean that's good you thought you got to see some titties psych next is Bella canvas Bella canvas this one feels a little bit better this guilting was a little bit it's not I can't say it's itchy it's just different it's just a little bit different this one you can definitely tell they took their time with it the dyes I mean it just feels good I liked how the hello how come I have my own how the sleeves are it's not it's not tight it's not hugging too tight and by the way all of these are smalls I'm 5 2 and 1/3 ok I'm 5 to 130 so this is what it looks like I mean this is how it looks on me [Music] so this one as of right now between the two that I've already warned this one is definitely tough like I said the color is different the color you can definitely check tell the color colors apart this was deeper this one is like I said this is like an Ashley black this is Gildan Ashley black and right now I have on the belly canvas it's not getting into focus but this is the Toltec okay again this is a small this is a small not too bad I like the fields I like to feel I kind of I when it comes to the actual sleeves I like how Bella canvas and gilt it kind of wraps around and it's tight with this one this one's kind of loose it's not a bad thing it's definitely preference but I don't like I don't I like it to hug me hug me tell me how you really feel so my number one is Bella tall Tex and then the Gildan Gildan is okay I feel like I just feel like the Gildan it's just it's just it's just just this is just I don't know what I got to do to get that feel it like I said you gotta try these things on because it's one thing for somebody to tell you it's another thing for y'all actually feeling it on your skin this feels good like a bread my titties for tuning in this is the start of my visual interpretation support me I love y'all all the realest just a lead", "C42BmGVCeHw": "hey I'm durian joined by my wife in celebrity menswear stylist Ashley P Weston hi so today ash and fellas we are talking about what are the best budget-friendly teachers so where you are doing the budget-friendly ones and I wanted specifically to do like the mall versions of it you know like of the / H & M's and all that that's available both in a mall and online and the kind of the fash fat fast fashion stuff and so but we also wanted to start off with just doing white t-shirts because it is so effing hard to find a good white t-shirt so we decided to just test out all the different brands white t-shirts and see which is the best because then from there the colored ones are super easy [Music] and ash before we really get into it first of all let's talk about inline dimensions so guys you can kind of gauge it and see what's what I'm six-three about 180 185 pounds these days I typically wear a medium across the board and as far as waist size on about a 32 by about 32 to 34 lengths and so guys take that for what it is that's my sizing and then you can kind of gauge where maybe it will be a little different and also these are unwashed we haven't washed them so they will shrink up a little bit in the length maybe how much would you say on the sleeves would it shrink up not too much quarter of an inch so if you got more than that on the sleeves it's never going to be tight but it definitely goes up an inch to about an inch and a half when you want each one the length I would say an inch inch and a half so ash real quick what do you look for in like a good t-shirt like what constitutes a good t-shirt so there's a couple different aspects that you want to make sure are present with whatever t-shirt you end up going with so first is just the thickness of the fabric especially with white there's a lot of thin thin thin white t-shirts and just bend t-shirts in general out there which you want to avoid because it starts to clean to your body it looks really cheap but it could be very unflattering so you actually want a slightly thicker cotton and then I'm in terms of just the fit the neck you want it to not be too loose around your neck you don't want to have a super thick border around the neck either and then the sleeves you want it to like lightly hug your biceps it could be like a little you know loose around your bicep but not too much second to last feature is just the body of the t-shirt you want to make sure that you can pinch no more than I would say like an inch or two a fabric on either side 1/2 inches of fabric on one side of your bellybutton yeah basically length one side of your stomach kind of here-ish yeah and then the last feature is to just make sure that the length your t-shirt hits like just past your belt buckle into like me mid mid fly zone no shorter and no longer than that because then it just throws off the whole proportions of your body and then you start to look like you have either a really long or really short torso compared to your legs so those are the main features you want to look for and we've got a whole article on video dedicated to how your t-shirt should fit and how to style them and up and down as far as dressy versus casual linked in the description below so definitely check it out all right now let's really get into the best budget-friendly t-shirt crew neck t-shirt crew neck t-shirt alright so first up we've got the Uniqlo supima cotton t-shirt and they retail for about 990 about 10 bucks each or if you get to I think you like a beat bucks each I'm a huge fan of their t-shirts actually buy them in bulk but for my clients because the price points great and I love the fit of their t-shirts it's not super billowy it's like the perfect fit and the torso it lightly hugs the bicep and it's actually a good amount of thickness for the material so the white isn't super sheer it's gonna be very difficult to ever find a white t-shirt that is not not sure because white in general in and of itself unless you are literally the color of white will always show a little bit of your skin color it's inevitable I think the best way to tell the difference between a quality or thicker material of a white t-shirt is you look at the caller versus the rest of the shirt what is the contrast between it if it is ridiculously like dark the second the colors like you know that the stitching right past that point here that's gonna be way too thin agreed next up is the j.crew mercantile broken and crew neck t-shirt and it retails for $14.99 okay so this it's really interesting because I actually do like j-cruise t-shirts but I think there are they are definitely made for man who is not on the thin side so who has a regular build or maybe more of a stomach because the cut of their t-shirt is very they're very roomy in the body even in the sleeves the t-shirt sleeves it's it's definitely not hugging your bicep whatsoever so it's actually making you look even thinner than you are so ash who would be what what type what body type would be best for this shirt so if you are a gentleman that has a little bit more weight in the midsection then definitely this t-shirt is for you but if you're a thinner gentleman I would say avoid or if you're a little more muscular I think because it's very roomy I noticed a very roomy in the belly section and if you obviously have a trim waist that's just gonna swim around you and you're gonna have to get it tailored at that point for a $15.00 teacher he's like okay we just you gotta try different brand agreed okay moving on okay ash and up next is the top man when they call an white classic t-shirt retails for 10 bucks or aching it to for 16 so by $8 each so what did we think about this one ash it is way to roomy in the body as well as in the sleeves and it's quite thin and material it's definitely way too large and the crazy thing is is that this is a medium but it's fitting you as if it's a size large so you look so so thin in this t-shirt um so I would not recommend anyone wear these t-shirts on their own and next up is the H&M regular fit cotton t-shirt retails for $6.99 ash what do you think so their t-shirts are definitely on the thinner side which is why I'm not a fan but it's really tight in your armpits except the sleeves are still billowing out quite significant which makes your arms look really thin and then there's again a lot of room in the torso and the t-shirt itself is super long so not a fan at all don't know it's crazy long I think it's just a little bit longer and if you washed it it would shrink up at least an inch or two so it might be okay but that still doesn't get the fact that it is a very thin material and you can see where my pants are versus Wizkid that is a big no-no you absolutely don't want to be able to tell that with any white t-shirt next up is the zara basic slim fit t-shirt and it retails for about 18 bucks ash what do we think number one that is quite an expensive I'm a true believer that you should not spend more than I would say like ten dollars or so somewhere around there on a t-shirt because even even a two to $300 t-shirt is still gonna wear just as quickly as a five to ten dollar t-shirt so definitely t-shirts are not something you should invest in that is my belief I think you should actually just get more budget-friendly t-shirts and just constantly replenish them as they're wearing out now with this t-shirt it is as you can see way too tight on Dorian and it actually so it tapers down where it gets tighter on the midsection so if you have a little bit of stomach and you don't have like a perfect V for me like Formation going down to wide shoulders trim off then this t-shirt is going to be very unflattering and it's really tight in the armpits when I was wearing it - I'm pretty broad in the shoulders and for a medium this was like pretty painted on it was a little ridiculous and then it's that very it's a very weird material it's got like a white grinning or something and I hate to say it but I feel a little like 90s douchebag muscle shirt I think it was just a big fat no across where I put it on I was like oh God alright I'm doing this for you guys but this would not be anything I would ever wear just touching it I was like no I you like how the sleeves are lightly hugging your biceps that's great but that's the only redeeming feature for this t-shirt next up is the Banana Republic supima cotton crewneck and it retails for about 18 bucks an - what do we think so I actually like the way it fits your torso it's not a ton of material billowing around your stomach area but the sleeves are definitely on the long side generous and wide and long yeah so it's it's just fitting funky there I mean it's something that could easily be tailored but why when there are other again other options that will fit you better so I would say if you are a slim to regular build even if you have a little bit of stomach but but you have more muscular arms this t-shirt could be great for you so you're more of an athletic guy but not crazy trim in the stomach area then this would probably be a good option for you and last but not least - is the in all read in office it's quite long Express slim stretch cotton crewneck tee and it retails for about 23 bucks what do you think so the fit isn't terrible I mean I'm Dorian because he carries a little bit of weight in his midsection as men do when they're older so it's definitely hugging that area which is a no-no that's not what you want but if you don't have that problem where you're pretty slim in the stomach area then this t-shirt actually fits really great I like how it's the sleeves are lightly hugging Dorian's biceps the armpits are not digging into his armpits and then the torso itself it's it's not bad at all now I will say this 20 how much is it 23 bucks 23 dollars is quite expensive for a t-shirt that I would never pay 23 dollars for a t-shirt ever for my clients at all so you'd rather get a $10 shirt and spend five dollars on tailoring then spend 23 dollars on a shirt that fits mostly good yes really 1000% okay so unless you want to do what ash is proposing then maybe 22 hours not the worst taste scenario ever if you just don't want to have to deal with anything ash so out of all of the options that you saw what would you say is the best overall all-around winner today hands-down Uniqlo's t-shirts the fit is fantastic doesn't matter what your height is if you're an extra small small medium large extra large I just think that the fit is fantastic now obviously we went through each of these t-shirts and and we went over like the type of man that and depending on your build this t-shirt could be right for you but overall I would definitely go with easy class start with Uniqlo Uniqlo whatever and then try that out if that doesn't work then obviously come back to the video and see what options would fit you a little bit better based on how it how it fits you originally but I agree wearing it now then we're gonna for a little since I got it a couple weeks and I picked up quite a few of them I have to say it is definitely one of the better options for budget-friendly guys links to everything in the description below leave us your comments below if you've got experience with other fast fashion II type of brands we haven't done any online brands yet we'll do that next and we haven't done any luxury brands yet we will do that as well so leave your comments below about which are your favorites and we'll take it from there thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it we'll see in the next one [Music]", "bzUKFDqOIzk": "now whistle guys today I'm going to show you guys out a pretreat and press a white t-shirt what I'm using right now it's a next-level 100% cotton also do the same with Gildan 100% cotton um those are mainly the tool on t-shirt that I use so first things first you get your own t-shirt on your first I'm using the star hotronix 16 by 16 heat bricks and I'm using craft paper you can use parchment paper or Teflon sheet I normally recommend and prefer craft paper on the difference is parchment paper it's a lot more fragile it won't last too long before it starts like ripping apart on the craft paper you could get a lot more usages out of it quite hundreds if not more and the Teflon sheet it's really durable but it leaves a shiny coating on top of your graphic so normally I go with on craft paper and I'll fight for a link in the description all you need to do all right now I'm going to pre-press it to get the moisture out of the shirt so it's going to be you could pre-press it for 10 to 15 seconds I have excel at three hundred and forty degrees it doesn't have to be that high you're just pretty person so so right now my thing will sit at 40 but I'm just going to count it down ten seconds our 15 10 to 15 so that's good so right now it's pretty pressed you could see the steam coming out might be hard to see on the camera now we're going to move over to our pretreat there are leaks to pretreat it on okay and that's our base let me click the camera real quick okay that's good okay so this I made out of particle board for the same size as your BCG platen 11.7 by 16 and a half I recommend using particle board because um with plywood your pretreat will just run off if you have any overspray this one will just soak right into it so all you do is you spread it out put your shirt on there and I normally use firebird on pretreat for both light and dark t-shirts so that's the one that I use and you need one of these it's a Wagner sprayer I see a lot of people use a little spray bottles online that you will get a good pretreat on your t-shirt to be you done I recommend the Wagner sprayer yesterday and it's very important that you look at the way I have it set up found like a Python you guys picture there more details if your - or because you need it but normally I set mine right at the edge of where the yellow knobby so the thing is you'd be screwed all the way in it's going to have too much free cheese when you spray it it might run or my drip my leek and if you spray it all the way out it gets less what you need is just a mix that's all you need is a bit you don't need if you start seeing like water like bubbles or like it's starting to drip then it's too much if you over pretreat your shirt the results won't be too good so we do it you purge it first I'm going to go like a touch spring right here if you guys could see it and you can see each other camera it's just a light coat you know you know you don't need a you know mediator to run you just need a light coat and we're going to do one it needs to be at least 12 inches away from from your shirt you're going to go one this way two three you're going to go up one two three so let's beginning start all the way before the shirt and then you come across you don't need to go too fast or too slow cause if you go too slow then you might start saturating the t-shirt so here we go then you're going to also need a roller you could get me get office feet on home depot or lowes and you just need to just gently roll it all you're doing is basically pressing the pretreat into the material you don't need to press on it a lot just lightly roll it so that's that that aside and now we're going to go back to the heat press maybe you could use a valid line I missed a white tee so it's going to be harder normally I pretreat white t-shirts because it makes the color pop a little bit more but it's not required and depending on the shirt that you're using you don't necessarily need to pretreat a white tee because I've done so without pretreat before I came out good it's not better than the one that I preached it is they're all the things on the graphic that you're printing with the color and the material that you're printing on the type of shirt so like I said it's not really recommend if you're not it's not really necessary for you to appreciate a white shirt put out now we're going to go back to the press try to dry it out and set the camera grab your craft sheet and I'm going to be pressing this at 340 degrees for 40 seconds at medium pressure that's number four on on beyond hotronix so you can see the steam coming out of it and normally you once that's done your craft sheet should just slide off off your t-shirt if it sticks to it like whenever you're pulling it back if you die calm just grab it onto the shirt just purse it again for around ten seconds pull it off just slowly peel it off and then push it again for ten seconds so let me see if it's going to slide off or I'm going to need to do it again okay so there's just a little tiny bit of resistance you always hold it on to that corner so let me just press it back for five to ten seconds okay that should be good and then you can see it just slides right off so that right here is your pretreated white t-shirt another thing I want to throw in there you just put this aside heat gun um this is a laser grip heat gun I'll probably put a link in the description for this but what it does is it has a laser light on the front I'm going to shine it on the wall if you could see it on the wall and check the camera may be hard to see on the camera but it has a laser light and as a temperature when I point it to the heat press you keep that 328 29 it fluctuates because I'm not holding it steady but it's normally accurate or close to the actual temperature on the arm on the heat press reason we need this if you are using a cheaper heat protect one of those ones on eBay I wouldn't recommend them but if that's the one that you have a lot of times your gauge may be staying 340 degrees but your heat plate is probably less than 300 which is that's not good for your your your t-shirt so it's good to get one of these they're cheap it gives you accurate um or close to accurate reading so that I would definitely recommend you guys get one of those so there you go another thing to watch out for some heat presses the Spencer might be a particular degree like right now when I point in the center of mind is showing the same as what we got on there 3:45 at 3:40 sometimes the edges on those cheaper heat presses the heat core on the inside doesn't go all the way to the edges or in there it's cold spot so when you get those cold spots it's not good for a print because then your print some parts of your print might not might not armed they might not seal properly so it might not cure properly I should say so you might find cracking or it just doesn't come out of it but that's good size shirt I want to do another video for black t-shirt I like it", "uXsKypBy0Wg": "what is up you guys hope you are having a good day today we have a little bit more of a casual video but i think it is also a very helpful video at least for me in the past it's been very helpful especially saving a lot of money so if you're like me and you go thrifting a lot you know you can't really obviously always try the clothes on whether you're doing stuff from ebay or poshmark can't you can't try them on so you just take these people's measurements and you just trust them and sometimes they come in absolutely wrong just way off and that is the case with a few items that i have now a lot of the times when things are too small you know you like to return them they just don't fit but there's a way in a very easy and cheap way that you can just stretch them out and they become the perfect size for you so that's what we're going to be doing in this video today so we have this vintage sweat shirt right here and it's just way too small like the sleeves barely even reach my wrist um so these need to be longer it's it's supe it's like skin it's like a i'm wearing like a workout shirt right now it just needs to be bad gear it's too tight in the chest area um it's just too tight all around everything needs to be kind of elongated lengthened this needs it's just we're gonna be stretching this bad boy so that's what we're doing so the things you're gonna need for this are the clothes in question some warm water and some conditioner and that's all you [Music] need [Music] so we're going to let that sit in the sink in the water and the conditioner for about 30 minutes let it marinate let it soak up all of the nice conditioned water what it does is the conditioner kind of acts as like a fiber loosener so all of that cotton or if it's wool or whatever it may be it'll loosen up those fibers so you can stretch it and then when the once you stretch it and it dries it'll stay in that shape in that position to whatever you whatever you stretched it to so this really only works as well as it does with like sweaters and sweatshirts and tops i've never really tried it with pants or anything like that i don't know why you would need to do them on pants but yeah i just use them on my tops really so that's what it does we'll be back in 30 minutes after you've dried it out don't ring it just roll it and squeeze then you can start stretching it wherever you need to [Music] all right i'm outside now it is stretched it is ready to set in place i have it outside letting it dry since it's like 100 degrees outside don't let it dry in the sun just let it air dry and then i will show you the finished results once it is done you can pretty much do this like i said with any type of sweater sweatshirt t-shirt that kind of stuff all right so we're here on day two i have to let it dry outside but uh as you can tell the sleeves actually have some bagginess to them some length same with the body it's not like you know stuck to my chest like a muscle t so i mean this is a success how you you successfully have stretched out your garment with this one i love it it's like you know nice and kind of slim kind of trim and yeah you can pretty much do that with like i mean i haven't done it yet but i'm going to be doing it with this one you can do with t-shirts you can do it with sweaters if you get a sweater that's too tight on you um so you can do a lot of things with just some water and some conditioner it's all you need to do and then you know there you go so i hope you guys enjoyed this was a very quick video i hope you uh learned something you don't have to return it you can just stretch it out a little bit and technically it might fit you better um let me know in the comments what you guys do to make clothes fit you better if you stretch them if you shrink them some diy things that you do so i'll be talking to you guys soon have a good day you", "W4vsvOXJb40": "good advice just before we do get into today's video just jump in here to let you know that by the time Sunday's video comes we would have hit 10,000 subscribers which will just be amazing so for that video I want to do a Q & A so I pretty much just make sure you stay to the end of the video and I'll tell you guys what to do so yeah let's get back into the video q guys standing here welcome back to my channel and in today's video we're going to be looking at the best white t-shirt to purchase all right how are you guys doing today so I hope you guys have been dressing well getting things done and kind of just smashing it all together now before we do get into today's video make sure you do give this video a nice big thumbs up and if you're new to the channel make sure you do click that subscribe button down below also if you guys want to keep up with me on the daily you can go check out my Instagram which is at I'm Daniel Simmons white t-shirts they are like a staple for your wardrobe everyone has them they go with everything it's just a must to have any wardrobe now obviously almost every store and every brand sells a white t-shirt of some sort what's actually the best one to get because guys white t-shirts the price can vary from five pounds all the way up to 500 pounds so with that huge price difference how do we actually know which is the best one to get so that's what I've done is gone out it's just for brand new t-shirts from four different places now the stores that I chose are more tailored to obviously well I would typically kind of shop and like I said before almost every store sells a white t-shirt so it's not like I can you know just go you have the room with pile up t-shirts everywhere now with the four t-shirts the price range vary from 10 pounds all the way up to 150 pounds and what we're going to be doing in the videos guys is breaking these t-shirts down into four categories price quality fit and wearability so with all that being said guys let's get straight into it so the first t-shirt that we are starting off with is the cheapest one that I've picked up and this is coming in at 10 pounds and obviously it's gonna be from ASOS what I've done is I've purchased actual a sauce brain now with all the t-shirts I have gone for a size large now two of them are a bit more on the oversized look and the other two is just a bit more of your standard fitting t-shirt hi guys so here it is that a sauce t-shirt this is classified on their website as an oversized look let's break it down straightaway price ten pounds so already that's off to a good start can't really go wrong with that then we come into the category two which is the quality now for ten pounds for quality isn't two that it is a very very light material even when you wear it it goes a little see-through like you can see my tattoos a little bit the neckline is quite weak now what I mean by when I say weak is that if you put this in the wash quite a few time typically what it will do is it'll start to the collar like the neckline will start to kind of crease and fold a little bit and that is just because of the material you know at the same time it's not actually too bad like it's not like a terrible quality or anything now as far as fit guys as you see here I like the fit like it's an obvious size to it you can't really go wrong there and they did a good job like the length at the bottom of the hem isn't too long so it doesn't make you like shorter it's not a longline fit it's just an oversized but for 10 pounds I'm very happy with the t-shirt you just need to know that if you do wash it quite a few times this shape will start to change a little bit now coming into the wearability now wearability what I mean by this is what can you actually get away wearing this with I would pretty much say just it's only a casual t-shirt even when you wear on body it does just have that casual vibe to it like it is the type of t-shirt that you know if you're going out to you today you guys skating you know if your missus needs to wear it or whatever like you get a stain on it it doesn't matter too much it's kind of the wearability that I'd say of it like I wouldn't wear this out to a nice dinner but I would wear it you know if I'm going out and about throughout the day and I don't mind I get kind of like hot and sweaty or anything innit now this next t-shirt guys is 25 pounds so it's stepping it up a bit and this is from the store cost 25 pounds for a good t-shirt that can last you a long time and wear it a lot and get a lot of use out of it awesome coming into quality you can feel the quality difference between this and the a sauce want straight away it is much heavier it's much studia it's the type that will last in a one shrink in the wash now coming in for the fit guys as you see this is not an oversized but the shoulder lines drop at the normal shoulder height so there is no drop to shoulder the hands and fitted but they're also not that oversize but it's kind of like in between bits so depending on the t-shirt this is a good thing or a bad thing it can be kind of that awkward stage between okay wait you're not an oversized foot but you're not putting my arms properly am I the right one for you my the right size for you so it's kind of like that little vibe going on come into the last bit wearability now you can definitely wear this casually but the great thing about this one is it feels n even looks much better quality so I'd be more than happy to tuck this in you know going out to dinner that is the cost one so far very happy with this one especially with the price and the quality all right guys the third t-shirts from All Saints and it's coming in at 40 pounds this is an oversized further stays on the top still a size large 40 pounds guys so we're getting into the price 20 pounds were Cain getting onto that you know you're starting to drop a bit of money you'd hope this t-shirt with last year quite some time coming into the quality very similar to the a sauce one even on the neckline and everything it's a very similar t-shirt like it feels a little bit better than the a sauce but I still feel for the price this isn't going to last you as long as you'd actually want it to now the fit guys as you see on body this is pretty much the exact same but as the a sauce one yes the omelette there's a little bit longer but overall that actually pretty much looks the same and wearability you guys again coming in I would wear this casually I would wear it you know going out through the days maybe you go for a drink that you know I might wear it with a jacket over it but as far as just a standalone piece if I was going to dinner again still no it doesn't have that feel to it still feels very casual all guys come into the fourth and final t-shirt and this is an acne studio white t-shirt now yes I do know that does have a little bit of detailing which the others don't on the collar but that's just because it is from acting studio now this t-shirt comes in at a whopping 150 pounds so 150 pounds that is a lot of money to drop on a t-shirt so this t-shirt must need to do something crazy for you must need to you know you want this t-shirt to be able to pass down through generations and generations to your kids okay that's how good the material should be in this so price already nut you're paying 150 pounds for the brand here which isn't a bad thing at all so price not unless like I said I can pass this down to my kids and their kids naked coming in at quality now it is the best quality out of water then I can tell you that straight away video nice and heavy you can feel the quality it's so soft as well honestly guys this is this is the type of tissue that will not even change a little bit in the wash which is so good about it coming in about the fit is again you see it's not an oversized foot it is a bit fitted this is actually how the t-shirts meant to me do you feel a little bit of the elastic in it where it's just you know after wash it'll just grow straight back to the fit that it should be now coming on to the wearability it's the type of t-shirt especially kind of cousins a brand behind it that you can just wear all the time you could wear it very very low-key you know just with some shorts and some shoes and the summer time and then you can also really mix it up with the smart pants if you were going out to dinner alright guys so that's the t-shirt we've looked at the more we've broken them down now it's time to order them and actually say which is the best white t-shirt purchase when you look at the price quality fit and wearability so in my opinion the worst out of them is the AllSaints one for forty pounds I just don't think the material or anything holds up to that price point at all especially when the ASOS one is pretty much the same t-shirt and that is 10 pounds now dude okay I have to say the heck nice to do one now great quality it's great great great but the price just you can just never for just a white t-shirt justify the price with it okay so no matter how good quality was it was the best quality all of them and I love the t-shirt but for that price for a white t-shirt no like it's just you can't know now coming in number two a sauce I like a sauce what can I say ten pounds standard t-shirt if you mess it up get a new one it's not going to last you the longest amount of time but it's ten pounds and it's still good but it still looks good and it's pretty much the same that's the wall Saints one that means coming in the number one I've got to give it to cost 25 pounds or a very good quality t-shirt the quality is just under the acne studio one and it is 25 pounds like it feels so good is it's gonna last you a long time and it's not gonna get messed up in the wash so definitely I think the best wet t-shirt that you guys can purchase out of the ones that I reviewed is the close one alright guys and there we have it the best white t-shirt that you guys can purchase what I will do is I'll leave a link in the description box below to all of the t-shirts if you guys want to pick them up what's up guys it's me again I know but just

and what's irrelevance singles and weight are some of the most important factors that you will need to pay attention to when purchasing a shirt I'm about to tell you why next hey guys it's Mel also a shirt space so let's first touch on singles single refers to the diameter of the yard and is calculated by the number of times that that yarn has been twisted think of it like you do sheets the higher the thread count the nicer and the softer the sheets end up be in the apparel industry singles range from 18 to 40 so let's look at three tees within this range the first tee we're gonna look at is from all style the al 1301 is a six ounce 100% cotton tee that has a single count of 18 the 3600 is a 4.3 ounce 100% cotton tee that has a single count of 32 the three four one three si is a three point eight ounce tribe leg that has a single count of 40 so have you started to notice a pattern here the higher the weight the lower the single why is that so let's dive into weight weight is the weight per square yard and is usually listed in ounces so here's the correlation between singles and weight now let me make sure I get this right one pound of one single yarn is 840 yards long while one pound of 10 singles yarn is 8400 yards long aka the higher the single the tighter the yarn the softer and lighter the T is thank you guys so much for stopping by to learn the importance of singles and weight if you guys have any questions or video ideas go ahead and put them in the comments below make sure you subscribe turn on your notifications and have a great rest of your day thank you for sticking around with a video this long I hope you're enjoying our educational videos we have a lot more to come but make sure you subscribe so you don't miss any oh and come check out our Instagram you won't be disappointed", "bRLH928lwNg": "[Music] well guys welcome back to another video right so today what we've got is the perfect or white t-shirt trying to find the perfect white t-shirt we've got loads of different brands to go through I've got nine t-shirts in total we've got brands like Ralph Lauren Tommy Hilfiger Thailand's God and then like low-rent brands like bershka a sauce jammie so I'm gonna link all the t-shirts in the description but I thought it'd be interesting to see what the comparison is like from like a six quid t-shirt to a forty five quid t-shirt so we're gonna go in price order this is the lowest going all the way up to the highest and the roll on a size large as well but if you do enjoy the video guys that don't forget to drop it a like subscribe to the channel if you've not already impressed a little bail notification just to keep up to date on all the videos but yeah I start trying them on to see what they're actually like alright so the first teacher we've got is the cheapest one it's from ASOS it's an organic regular fit t-shirt size large like I said so my measurements for reference are six foot two and about 190 pounds which is about 87 kilos alright guys so six pounds estas design organic tea the only problem I have with ASUS t-shirt is you see this shoulder bit hurt on literally every t-shirt it has this wrinkly Creasy bit it's just every kind of t-shirt no matter if it's like slim fit muscle for normal regular fit they always have it it's very strange you need to sort out the designs but apart from that it's actually a very good teacher by the length is good alright the quality the quality is quite nice it's quite nice and thick done for six quid can't really go wrong this the whole of it is quite high as well so it's quite thick it's a bit like a roll neck but I do quite like it it's pretty nice but alright let's move on to the neck Tron all right I second t-shirts from Bershka this is $7.99 and as you can see it's a lot more of a tighter fit so this is definitely kind of like a muscle foot it's got more of a scoop neck so a lot bigger than that a lot wider you can see like collarbones and upper chest and stuff if you go to the gym and you like tighter t-shirts this one could be for you but I don't want teachers this tight anymore this is I think it's like trying too hard you're not I mean like you don't need to wear t-shirts this tight even if you do go to the gym like you just need one that is a nice fit that it's not too tight because like I said it's just like you're trying too hard not about teacher the quality feels nice nice and stretchy which is good just a bit too tight third t-shirts from sulphate clothing at my own brand this one is 12 pounds size large again this for me is basically the perfect fit so it's a nice heavy cotton it's just cotton there's no stretch in it which I do kind of like it's going to shrink a tiny bit in the wash ball not too much I think it's really nice on the arms and the sleeves good length on not too tight but it is fitted it's quite slim fitted minimal Brandon as well I've designed this one so it is a really nice tissues only 12 quid as well but yeah this is my favorite definitely so far this is why I designed it because I've already tried all these on over the years no I mean I'm trying to perfect the t-shirt so if you do not check anything out from sulfa it's gonna be linked in the description make sure you and have a look like really comfy clothes nice fitting get involved fourth t-shirts from Jack and Jones this is actually like a bit of a different material it's like a piec cotton which is what you'd usually get on like a polo shirt it's like a really nice fit you know like the length is good it's nice on the arms it's not too tight it's got a bit of a roll in the sleeves as well I could maybe size up to an XL and it probably like the perfect to fit definitely in somebody that need to size up to an excel because some sizes do definitely run small which is you only really find out from trying stuff on doing you so I hope this video helps you in that sensible yeah it probably size up it's a nice t-shirt fits well in this one is 15 quit what I'll put it on the screen for you anyway so this one says the perfect tea we'll see about that alright so in the color this one says it's the perfect tea and in my opinion is far from it so it's from selected time I think this one is 18 pounds I'll put on the screen anyway it's just way too Thai guys like you see no it's high in this fit it's not ideal at all the cotton feels nice quality book it's too sure when the body as well as really sure and it's just tie everywhere and there's no unlike the birch the one which just stretching it this one doesn't have any stretch either so it's definitely not the perfect see that's why I've made this video I you can get some that let's think of the perfect tea but they're honestly not so I won't go for this at all guys alright so we get n into more for designer brands now this one is Tommy Hilfiger a little minimal logo this one is 22 pounds size large again like I said I think I'd have to size up for this one because the t-shirts run really small and it's really short on my body don't you can't really properly see but if you over six four it's gonna be short on your body and just a bit tied like around the chest shoulders and arm so if I got an XL it would be fine the quality feels okay Ike doesn't feel the best quality and 20 secret Tommy Hilfiger I do really like the minimal brand in the tiny logo I think it does look pretty sick to be honest guys so quite a nice to see it's just a bit as usual alright so as a seventh t-shirt is from a brand called the Lyle and Scott it's got this really nice gold logo on it here v this one is absolutely banded it's really really nice although that's all for clothing one this probably the best fitting one in here I think the quality is really nice as well tell it's like a really nice high quality blend of cotton feels really nice in length spot-on on the body for me it's nice on the arms nicer on the shoulders and chest this is spot on really nice fit it's not too tiny either alright guys the second-to-last t-shirt is from a brand called original penguin it's got a little penguin logo here this one is 25 pounds again it's very similar to the Lions got one book just a bit of a tighter fit so the quality of the cotton feels very similar nice and have the really good quality but it's definitely a bit tighter like around the arms the chest a little bit shorter as well in the body so the Lions got one is just basically a better version of this one so I'd definitely go for the violence got both 25 quid very similar all right guys last but not least we have got one from Ralph Lauren the most expensive one hair thing is one is 45 quid and to be honest it's probably the worst fit here out of all these is the most expensive in it's the worst fear like look how short it is in the body so short at least after un XL is really spike tight and small around the chest and upper body as well the Asians one is about a foot in it's six quid yeah the quality feels nice the logo is really nice the Brandon's good but just make sure you size up if you're going to get one from Ralph Lauren because the size is run really small alright let's do a recap I'll give you my top three of this bunch so guys to recap on all the t-shirts if I was having to pick three out of the whole bunch I'd probably go for a while and Scott sulfa clothing and Jack and Jones than my top three like if you want one that is a little bit more expensive really high quality really nice heavy cotton with a decent fit go for the island spot one really nice pure white color really good quality it's probably last you quite a while to a five quid so she's not even that bad really if you want one that's a little bit cheaper I'll definitely go for sulphate clothing or Jack and Joe just depends on what sort of material you like this is more of like a polo shirt material and then this is like a normal t-shirt material but again 12 quid 15 quid both really nice t-shirts or just size up in this one but this one is true to size so guys that's gonna wrap up the video I hope you found it a little bit helpful if you're in the market to get a whitey - I'm sure this has helped you out a little bit but it's just mad how like it's been for if I put on a t-shirt like from Ralph Lauren and it'd just be such about fit there's no ideal are towards it so definitely size up if you are going to get from Ralph Lauren especially I think that's a custom slim fit but yeah if you don't see more videos like this guys don't forget to drop it a like subscribe to this channel if you've not already and I'm gonna link all the t-shirts in the description thanks for watching I'll catch you on the next one see you later [Music] you", "Q_Lk0l1ECss": "We're here talking about the Gildan 100%\ncotton long sleeve t-shirt. Now this is our standard 100% cotton\nlong sleeve t-shirt kind of our big group order t-shirt. There's nothing\nI'd say super special about the cotton on this. It is gonna be the standard\nhundred-percent cotton. It is a great price point however. There are softer\nshirts but, they're a lot more expensive. The sleeve length and\neverything is pretty standard. The sleeve kind of, how wide it is, is also pretty standard. But instead of just telling you about it we do have our model here and he's gonna come over and you'll see it in action. The first thing you'll notice is it's a pretty generous cut both in the width here and the sleeves. They're both gonna be more generous. I don't wanna say baggy but\nthey're not gonna be tailored or tapered. So, as you can see here, there's no side\nseam. A lot of the softer shirts actually have a side seam because they're gonna be more tailored, and that tailored side seam on the softer shirts just makes it cut in. This is going to be more of a straight down, kinda more of a generous cut, so great for wide range of body types, I'd say. So, big events this is your go to long sleeve. The sleeve length also everything pretty standard here. We have a great cuff, it does, it's gonna basically hold very good over the course of the shirt. The neckline here, very standard hundred percent nothing special about the neckline to note, it's just a standard neckline. It's not going to stretch very far down and it's always gonna come back, which is key to 100% cotton. It doesn't have a lot of stretch to the fabric either. Now, you might be wondering about care instructions, will it shrink? Things like that. With this garment, don't really worry about shrinkage, but you might want to think about over the course of the lifetime of the shirt, being a year, or two\nyears, if you're washing and drying on high, it could shrink. That's one thing to note about a hundred percent but it is pre-shrunk you get it Very true to size when ordering. So, looks great and a great price point too, so if you're looking for a big group this is the shirt to go with. You look awesome Tyler, Thank you.

to do this [Music] they are design over the top of the HD sweat face down and lay a Teflon sheet on top press for the light to medium pressure we have it set to 190 degrees Celsius and press this for 50 seconds when the pressing time is up the heat press will be let the heat press to remove the Teflon sheet and peel back the sublimation paper as smoothly but as quickly as possible remember that the sublimation inks will still be active when taking the paper off the garment so remove it without smudging the paper against the fabric but this will lead to a ghosting effect that can ruin your

upside down but why does this happen let's get into it [Music] hey guys it's Melissa a shirt space so the shrinkage in the tee can be caused by a couple of things first it could be the way you wash it but the second can be if a shirt is preshrunk or not so let's get into that what does preshrunk actually mean the term preshrunk mostly speaks for itself but there are a few factors to be aware of so I took notes to make sure I get this right preshrunk doesn't necessarily mean that the t-shirt manufacturer washes every single garment instead it refers to the garment being put through a machine that pushes or compacts the fibers tightly together this process condenses the fabric by removing the spaces in between the stitches as a way of replicating the shrinking process in doing this the garment has been pre shrunk and will shrink less when being put through the traditional washing and drying process now let's be real I couldn't have memorized all of that point number two having a pre shrunk shirt doesn't always mean the shirt won't shrink further most fabric will shrink on average three to seven percent so you won't typically notice but there will always be some additional minimal shrinkage to be where bottom line is preshrunk implies that the shirt will no longer string but what is actually the case is it will just reduce the amount of shrinkage thank you guys so much for

the fabric the fit everything about this shirt is great for large groups instead of just telling you though I do have Maia coming over she's gonna show this off first thing you'll notice is great fit first because this side seam here now that means it's going to naturally hug your curves any lady shirt shouldn't be baggy like a unisex style it should naturally hug and this sure does that the next thing you'll notice is the neckline here it's a little lower than the American Apparel 100% ladies neckline the American Apparel is a little tighter this does offer a little more breathability so if you're looking for a hundred percent ring-spun cotton ladies t-shirt this is our go to it also it's a better price point than the American Apparel ladies hundred percent the other thing you're gonna see is just the sleeve length flattering it hits you right at the right part of the arm not too high not too low fits great feels great hundred percent ring-spun means that basically if you're thinking about sizing we do suggest maybe getting one size up so normally Maia would wear maybe like a small but in this we have her in a medium today just because with that cotton and just doesn't stretch as much so that's one thing to note with this if you order familiar drew sometimes err on the side of bigger because it's never fun to get a shirt good with this though we recommend any type of our eggs vintage or standard vintage being the lighter ink coat standard being a normal print a little thicker ink to make it pop but with this also comes in two 100% ring-spun this is a heathered garment and athletic gray meaning at any time we have a heathered means this could be 90 10 90 cotton poly which just means it's gonna have a little more stretch but still offers kind of that more snug fit great shirt overall one of our best selling ladies shirts and you can see why great price point great fit the neckline is awesome everything about it might look awesome in it I'm a co-ed monkey soft scale we rate this t-shirt a - thanks for watching this video please let us know if you have any questions because here at co-ed monkey soft matters and so do our customers", "g5QQLQG4lQI": "hi folks Martin here again we're to give you an update on this transfer paper we used in my last video of the dieter cotton sub lis power the emember net powder and the special transfer paper we've watched it a few times so let's have a little look to see how it's turned out right okay well here's the garment here and it's probably been through to watch four to five times so it's been worn quite a bit now and I'll just show you closely so that you can actually see the the finish on it and it degraded at all I'll show you I've got a new camera by the way so I should be adding some really close images of this so let's have a look at it now well though whether you can actually see that the the color seems to be okay it seems to have held up there and the feel of it as you can probably see is nice and soft and if I stretch it as you can see look we're stretching it there and as you can see it doesn't actually crack or split when you stretch it so I personally think that it's actually it's down a pretty good job so yeah let me try get near the actual ink looks like it's gone into the actual fibers itself look at that look that's pretty close detailed at any now I want to try and let me out because I'm very zoomed in oh not bare with me let's zoom back out there there we go and that's what we were actually looking at so that in my eyes is pretty impressive but I want you to take it one step further now don't forget we use sublimation ink with this so what I'm going to try now just thought about this and I'm going to give it a go I don't know if it's going to work or not because I believe that it might be the polymer powder which is holding the image into a takes it off if it takes the sublimation off of this special paper they give you the sublimation paper and it allows it to bind into there now when we use transfer papers the transfer paper is basically very similar I supposed to this polymer powder and I use dye based inks as you know so what I'm going to actually do is I'm going to print an image out on this transfer paper in dye based ink and then I'm going to put the powder over the top and see if we can transfer a dye based ink image as opposed to a sublimation ink image which is a lot dear a sublimation ink so we'll see how that goes so I'm just going to print an image out now and then we'll put the powder on so bear with me for a second right okay din well I've had to use some standard sublimation paper because this thicker stuff didn't want to go through my printer for some reason so I'm just going to put this now in there this is still a little bit wet there we go and I'm just going to get this sublimation powder just pour it over the top there like that and then just sprinkle it down the ink all over the ink as you can probably see and don't forget this is just standard ink this isn't sublimation ink in here so I don't know whether this is going to work or not couldn't tell you doesn't like it's really stuck to me to be honest with you okay din so we'll just lift out the standard paper which I don't think is going to work but we'll give it a go anyway and just place that facedown there put a little cover sheet on it I don't think this is going to work and give a 30-second blast we're on a kite night not transferred at all here we go so you must use sublimation ink with this as you can see standard ink doesn't work whatsoever so that is definitely an owner that is sublimation paper but that is normal dye based inks so you need to have the sublimation ink with this product to be able to do a peel away on a standard t-shirt so what I'll do I'll quickly just transfer this image now onto the sublimation printer and we'll actually do this image on a standard sublimation paper this time and see what it does with that no I don't think it's stuck to that paper either this is standard transfer paper and it's not actually stuck to that so we're now going to have to try the standard sub b2 cotton transfer paper and give that a go so again we'll put in our reco printer face down like that and print it again alright well I've actually run out of ink I've got a changing table motioning but you can see they're mostly this half of the picture is still looking look mottled and wet so let's put this in there sit this on there that okay here we go I get the image here alright so this is the image now to go onto our t-shirt right okay so place it face down all right here we go and we'll remove the transfer paper don't forget this is out of cotton t-shirt nice and then you go there's another one freshly printed there as you can probably see let's let down on the workshop so yeah there you go there's another one we print it out on the back of this so it appears that you have to have the right paper this with standard sublimation paper now this transfer officers right although I've printed out on this transfer paper which is sublimation paper this will actually transfer onto a polyester garment they're all mouse mat or anything even though it's dry to the touch because this is transfer paper and it's sublimation ink so there you go that appears to be holding up pretty well after about five washes and again we just printed a new one there we've tried it with a few different variations we try doing it with diabase things for that special powder that didn't work and then we went over to the sublimation ink and obviously that worked as well so it needs to be done on the paper that comes with this kit which is the sub litre cotton paper and this time why did I actually raise the temperature to 190 degrees C for 30 seconds that one I did 180 degrees C and it really hasn't really made any difference to be honest with you so hundred and ninety is probably a better one to go because you're going to get more penetration with the the material into the actual garment so anyway I hope that was of some used here that was me follow-up of our subleader cotton product which we tried in our last video ok then thanks very much hope you enjoyed this video and we'll see you again in the next video bye for now you", "RaBffG1zLL8": "today we made it into downtown LA home\nof the fashion district where creative entrepreneurs brands and businesses come\nto shop and sell the latest styles now whether you guys are consumers or\nactually in the fashion industry chances are you've seen rolls of fabric like\nthese which actually go on to become the products that you wear now virtually\nevery brand and business gets their start with a simple t-shirt crew neck\nand hoody and more importantly is a very interesting fact is they don't actually\nmanufacture the products themselves in fact a lot of the times are being\nmanufactured in large facilities so as a consumer you need to know that you have\nthe option and the choice to impact the world at large\nby the businesses that you'll go on to support so in this video I want to peel\nback some layers and actually show you guys how products are created on a mass\nlevel and I thought it'd be really interesting to start with how these\nfabrics are actually made cotton the most popular fabric in the world is\ncreated from the ground up before being made into the fabrics you wear it begins\nin the field where it has grown and picked by industrial equipment and\nshipped to be processed during the processing stage the cotton is cleaned\nup removing impurities and then the soft fluffy cotton you see becomes a strong\nfiber the process here is designed to create combed and ring spun cotton that\nhas a softer feel this type of fabric goes through an innovative spinning\nprocess that's designed to thoroughly soften and straighten each fiber the\nstrands will then tightly knit and woven together to create a raw fabric that is\nnow strong enough to be worn next time you're choosing a shirt take a look at\nthe fine details to see this for yourself\nonce the fabric is completed and then gets transported to a dye house where\nthe fabric is dyed to the color specified by the manufacturer the\nprocess we're showing you here is unique to Bella canvas which is the largest\ncutter and dhyryam apparel in America we take you guys inside of the state of the\nart facility to show you what it takes to make quality apparel for millions of\npeople all over the world as you see once this fabric is dyed it gets\ntransported as these fabric rolls which are then laid out across large\ncutting tables the fabric is stacked up to a hundred and fifty layers before it\nbeing mass cut inside of this factory they cut three million units a week and\nI personally always wanted to see how these machines layout the fabric so\nlet's take it out for a spin what's the worst that can happen so right out of\nthe gate there's this machine here and it has like all of these different\nsettings and I see this little this thing so I could just move this and it\nworks I'm going to reverse though huh let's let's crank this thing up but the whole thing my privado I messed up this fall\nI dig I think I did a bad job that's that's that's bad huh - push the button\nthere that is odd this buddy right here tightens up the rope\nshameless crap okay I'm gonna try it again how much right right\nyou know at first glance these machine seemed to move themselves but what I\nfound out is that it actually requires some skill in order to tighten the\ntension of the fabric as it's being laid out the faster you go the faster that\ntrigger fingers got to be in order to keep up once the fabrics are laid out\nthe cutting machine arrives to cut the fabric in the shape of the required\ndesign this is the cutting machine that essentially takes all the digital\npatterns that are created during the design stage and they input it into the\nsoftware which allows this machine to just automatically cut the panels which\nare then shipped to the facilities where they're going to be sewing right here I\ndon't know if you guys can see the screen but it's literally showing you\nwhere it's going to be cutting next and as it's cutting it's actually vacuuming\nthe entire operation so it vacuums that in order to make sure that the seal and\nthe fabrics lay very flat so there's no differences when it's actually cut these\nrobotic cutting machines ensure every single piece is cut precisely as it\nfollows a designer's blueprint keep in mind not every factory has something\nlike this these machines make it possible to get a consistent fitting\nshirt every single time once the panels are cut they are placed on carts and\nmove to the next part of the process and so just wanted to take you guys behind\nthe scene here as we as we show you guys where this fabric is\ngoing before it's being sewn and it got my boy Brett got the man see\nright over there but guys an interesting thing that we saw here is as you can see\nright here these are actually not moving so it makes you wonder how is that\nmoving right so I wanted to show you guys something really quickly here in\nbetween these lines here there's actually lasers so there's a laser\nguided system that actually brings the fabric as soon as it crosses a path it\nactivates the new beams here so let's check this out\nmoving not moving and moving haha check this out go check this out\nbring the camera a little closer moving not moving and moving yeah this is how\nthe fabrics are transported in masses in order for them to be bundled and finally\ncut so what oh you would have thought these\ntwo crashed right now but they didn't because of the way that everything is\nbeing automated and I feel that automation in the sewing process and in\nthe manufacturing facilities such as this that's based in Los Angeles with\nAmerican workers it's it's the way well it really is the way of the future and\ncompanies like Bella canvas are able to still produce a USA strong while being\nable to sew in different countries and put out a quality product so this is the\nway that things are moving and like this fabric let's get moving over to the\nbundling stage we can show you guys how that works\nso these fabrics back here as you guys can\nis the bundling machine so it's it's making sure that the fabrics are safe as\nthey're being transported to the next facility which actually does the selling\nthem investing into these types of logistics allows them to keep a quality\nproduct from the beginning all the way until it's done the scale of this\noperation is huge guys and as you guys can see from the forklifts to the\ncutters to everybody that's that's a part of this operation it really is\nsomething that requires a huge investment in the production as well as\nthe logistics and the team behind it thousands of people are employed here in\norder to get this to actually work so you could imagine that it's it's easier\nto cut corners than it is to do things right so when a company invests in doing\nthings the right way it really makes a difference in the market and it really\nmakes a difference in the world with rap fabric ready to be transported these\ncontainers play a logistical role in transporting materials needed for\nvarious parts of the production process globally these containers travel and\ncarry mass quantities of gray's goods which come from all over the world\nwhich are then dyed in an eco-friendly way in Los Angeles a fun fact is that\nthe USA China and India produce over 50% of the world's cotton this business\nchooses to die unprocessed fabric in Los Angeles in order to reduce the\nenvironmental impact commonly associated with Daiya fabrics in other parts of the\nworld once they are cut and dyed the majority the production is transported\nto Central America where they are sewn up and shipped back to the US a\nfulfillment center since we know how fabric is being dyed and transported for\nproduction we are wondering how they ensure the sewing factors are taking\ncare of their people and environment we spoke with Xavier to get the details you\nknow Bella canvas is making sure that every factory that is part of our supply\nchain is 100% certified by ara which is a certification that is granted to\ncompanies that are fully in compliance with labor laws and regulations in the\ndifferent countries where we operate the efforts that we made to make sure that\nyou know the workers that are part of our supply chain are being treated\nfairly not only in terms of other compensation also but you know all the\nsocial benefits that they receive recently we were approve also to become\na participating company with the Fair Labor Association which is like at the\ngold standard for our industry we are in the process of certifying the entire\nsupply chain is a it's a lengthy process and it will take some time but\neventually the company will be fully activated with the VFL a North America\nis made up of multiple Latin American countries and although sewing also\noccurs outside of the USA Bella canvas promotes a USA strong initiative which\nemploys thousands of workers in the USA while also producing a line of apparel\nthat is made here in the Los Angeles facility so as you guys to see right\nhere in this sewing factory they have literally over a hundred and fifty\nemployees skilled employees actually sewing the t-shirts in right here as you\nguys can see on this stack these are the cup panels we were showing you guys\nearlier more importantly I just wanted to share with you guys some of my\nthoughts in and some of the things that happen in the factories such as this the\nskill that's required to actually do a job like this so this is my man Felix\nright here and I won't I won't disturb his work that much but as you guys can\nsee it requires very skilled thought so with that being said a lot of workers\nactually only do one part of every garment which then goes on to the next\nperson to complete it and funny enough to show you guys like how difficult it\nmight be my brother actually over here my brother actually knows how to sew and\nwe were discussing like hey are you okay so you're already making excuses do you\nthink you can do it or not alright so Felix get a mpirica ladder\ncomo la so this machine is like it's this is a Pegasus w6\nand it's very beefy so they have two needles so right out of the gate we see\nthat there's there's a reason why workers are actually focusing on one\ntask so there's a lot of little pieces to the garment and if you were to try to\nsew everything yourself you'd probably screw up the entire shirt or a won't be\nas efficient so my brother Caesar here is is skilled in this if I were to try I\nwould have probably lost my finger but look at this guy he's actually doing it what's going on here guys you're holding\nup my line we got it good thank you guys for bringing us behind the scenes here\nand our that my brother slowed down the production line now you have to get can\nyeah but but overall you guys seem to be running a really tight ship how many\nunits do you think about the canvas is producing on on any given day so about a\nweek we're showing about three million units three million t-shirts so the\naverage of about 600,000 teachers per day oh yeah that's crazy\nbut what would you say is like is one of the things that the workers here need to\nhave in order to be successful in this career how many years have they been\nsewing for so some of these people have been working with us from the beginning\nso about you know 10 15 years they've been here it's people that I come here\nevery day they're being they're been here ever since at the beginning you\nknow what type of fulfillment do you think\nthey find in the sewing do you think they need to have a passion to work in a\nfactory like this you definitely have to you definitely have to enjoy it\nbut as you can see everybody comes in here and everybody's pretty happy you\nknow not sad faces yeah yeah it's definitely something that it's part of\nour culture now you know we're a big family\nwhat's the products are sown they undergo a quality control process that\nensures every t-shirt meets their test it's pretty crazy to see that there are\nreal people working on every single t-shirt that you wear so this is one\nthat passed the test right here yeah this is one that can go out to a\ncustomer yeah definitely ready to go and I think that's the beauty of like what a\nlot of people don't get to see is the fact that even though things are being\nmass-produced there's real people are like handling\nyou're populating it and there's real love that goes into it or a real passion\nyou got to have a passion for sewing and you got to have a passion for this\nindustry in order to stay in it with what 15 years yeah so it's a lot of time\nand energy that goes into one garment and it's a lot of people that handle\nthat one garment yeah it's about from the beginning to\nthe end there's about 13 13 people that but you know the teacher goes through\ninto it's completed not counting people into distributions in there yeah\nliterally hundreds of hands are going into the making of your product that you\nget at home and I think a lot of time we do miss the fact that there is a\npersonal touch to every single garment you guys whether it's mass-produced or\nwhether it's this is could be considered handmade I mean it really is because\nsomebody's making it with their hands so with that being said I wanted to leave a\nlittle note here you think I can leave a note in this box yeah there's like made\nwith love regardless of whether the finished garments come from their\nCentral American manufacturing facilities or in LA they ultimately\narrive at the fulfillment center where they are responsible for organizing and\nshipping to distributors and brands all over the world many entrepreneurs and\nsmall businesses rely on Bella canvas and suppliers like them to stock t-shirt\nblanks that can use to sell their designs now this company doesn't stay in\nbusiness by simply selling random designs and a bigger challenge that they\nalso have is the fact that they're selling to customers of all shapes and\nsizes so design wise they have to cater to a very large market so\nwant to go ahead and actually show you guys the behind the scenes of what it\nactually takes to design for a mass markets for millions of customers all\naround the world and we're actually going to see how they choose the colors\nthat are guaranteed to sell through to a large audience let's check that out man\nright out of the gate so this is where you guys do fittings yeah this is our\nfit room we spend a few hours a week in here with models and styles and we just\nmake sure that the styles fit on our base size models the best the best we\ncan interesting what is so like as I walked\nthrough here I felt like my equilibrium was almost off because it obviously\nthere's a sound panel but we'll the purpose for a sound panel enjoy cool\nwell no this is actually the Ellsworth Kelly from 1956 it's a sound barrier\nyeah he's a California abstract painter it's actually the exactly just absorb\nsound like so we're not bouncing around the room and little easier to tolerate\neach other I thought I had like a real like I thought it was a real pain I mean\nI don't think I'd be behind a glass door if that were the case of a real pretty\ncool so this is where you guys fit your models because you guys designed for\nmillions of people different body types all right we did we tried right you try\nwe're trying our very best so so how can you walk us through how how you are able\nto do that we want to fit on multitude of body shapes and sizes we'll start\nwith a base size size medium men's for instance for a unisex t-shirt 3001 we'll\nstart with our men's medium he's our basic block and so we start\nfitting on him when we have it tuned up the way we like the way it fits the\ndrape performance will go on to the next size so we'll fit eventually a full size\nrun so if there's a small all the way to like 4 XL let's say we'll fit every\nsingle size yeah so we're trying to take those silhouettes into consideration so\nyou mentioned earlier that you like to work directly with the manufacturing\nteam so as a design director how does working with the manufacturing arm make\nsure that what you guys are creating is going to be something beneficial for the\nworld at large working on the ground level just getting to the factory we\nhave a communication line that help is build product the delicate design\nprograms that we have we try to make sure that there's no pieces in between\nour sewing and our brains or the to the design vision and the sellers are kind\nof on the same page we develop fabrics and samples we send them back and forth\nuntil we alekhya them exactly the way we see them fit in a production setting and\nthat's important to us so that's part of the reason we have that connectivity\ntissue between sewing and the design vision is that we close the gap on all\nthe pieces that would go wrong by seeing each other in person by working together\nas a team so far as that this is super detailed process they are very\nmeticulous about what they do and the whole team is here to make adjustments\nin case there's anything to be done so this isn't the first sample set that\nthey had to actually fit this is actually a rendition so what they're\ndoing is essentially making sure that it all goes to spec before it hits the mass\nproduction okay so we're just gonna run through the specs again really quick and\nlike for instance the shirt I'm wearing this is actually one of you guys is more\nlater styles so this is something that you and your team came up with yeah so\nwhat what what inspires you for new designs and how do those like how do you\nguys kind of maybe make sure that they stay in the market for a while versus it\njust being a trend yeah this might be a trend you know it's a raw edge\ntranscends like I can't say this will be in the word forever is very scary\nfashion forever don't really jive certainly so what we'll try to do is\nwhat I like to see is like make the very best styrofoam cup that you can see at\nevery single coffee station forever without it leaking it's keeping its heat\nall those other components that the Styrofoam cup would have but ours is a\nbasic t-shirt we can dress it in skin it in different ways that speak to\ndifferent trends like raw edge seam work or pockets out to the side or however we\nwant to address it the core block that you see is our crewneck sweatshirt which\nwe feel very comfortable selling to a large community people can buy them\nprint on them embellish them in that market but in this case they can buy the\nnormal crew of pullover with raw edges everywhere it's\nmay get slightly more trend forward or fashion forward it's not enough to have\na great designer fit today as consumers we need to ensure that our purchasing\ndecisions do not support things that are unethical and oppressing others\nthat's where businesses such as these are raising the standards by not only\ngiving people an amazing product but by being transparent and doing things\ndifferently from how they treat their workers to the green initiatives in\nplace that are minimizing the environmental footprint on the other\nhand there are real problems happening around the world with apparel\nmanufacturing the constant drive to compete on price in order to sell\ngarments for pennies on the dollar as a resulted in producing in unsafe\nenvironments where buildings are failing and chemicals are being spilled into the\nenvironment the way your favorite products are being made today will\ndrastically affect the way our world looks like tomorrow now as we wrap up\nthis video I hope you enjoyed the process that we shared and how to shirts\nare made in America as you guys can see this operation is huge and the brands of\nbusinesses that you support also go through a process like this now the ones\nthat are just getting started the ones in your community that friends and\nfamily are be are actually creating are able to leverage resources such as bela\ncanvases infrastructure to actually make their brands and businesses without\nhaving to spend the millions of dollars that is required to do something like\nthis but more importantly as a consumer you have the power to choose the way\nthat the products are being created you see where you spend your money is what\nultimately is gonna dictate what the market and businesses such as these\ncreate so next time you go shopping or next time you're about to consider a\nbrand keep that in mind and more importantly if you guys enjoyed this\ntype of video I highly encourage that you guys hit that subscribe button right\ndown below and turn on post notifications for the newest episodes\ncoming to this

we're ready to print so forth the sublimation transfers of sublimation final as I should call it the sublimation file this one you need to pre-heat your press to three-fifty and my purse my camp is a little high I met 369 one state between and I know that sounds long but it's not so we're going to do 350 for 60 seconds when you print your final sublimation transfers your promo vinyl it's going to look like this okay so it's gonna give a dull look but once you press it this is what it's going to look like now this one is faster so once you press it gonna line up and these are the colors that you're done please so you see it's a big big difference okay and here's one that we actually be it on a t-shirt so we're going to go ahead and we're going to get started with this particular type of printable vinyl you do it comes with a clear backing and you see those sublimation inks they go all the way to the back so you do have to take this apart and remove it now because this is a pretty easy design it's all in one piece I can just remove it with my hands if maybe I was doing another video where I'm doing some tag sorts of things that are separated and I'll show you how to print how to pull those up early in the morning my mouth is very dry so that's just how you do it and you're gonna lay it face down and you always want to have some type of paper and you can use just regular regular old coffee paper this is my subs I'm sorry my screen credit transfer but I'm going to use this today while I'm waiting on my feet French to PETA is I just take my t-shirt and I fooled my t-shirt in half like this and I lay it on the fridge and I'm gonna move this camera over here some so I lay it on the crest I can lay multiple [Music] we are pressing under the stairs so all I'm doing is I'm giving a 17 and I can do five or six of these at one time if I need to [Music] so this give me a knife I already know whatever Spencer thirty and I know exactly what I'm told so that's fine everybody so I'm just going to take my transfer and because I've gotten to a point here I'm gonna [Music] without one and can't touch them done so you can't really go from scene from well I'll just pull that turnout sorry folks I'm gonna pop that down now because I'm doing sublimation vinyl transfers i'm not going to pre-press and I just had quit Princeton anyway so close this down and count off about 30 seconds go right to that [Music] and I'm going to lift my transfer straight up I don't want to leave it there and move it around okay because they'll get the wrong thing on it so I've got one down [Music] [Music] and normally don't use a ruler but [Music] now sublimation transfer they start to roll I'm gonna put something over that collar right there because it looks like a scientist I don't want that so just gonna do another one [Music] now let's remember that I am paying myself for the time that I print so always remember to calculate in your crisis the time that it takes you to print those garments [Music] good thing I didn't put that there [Music] [Music] the colors of nice and vibrant I'm continued with these [Music] [Music] but I'm always using just a regular heat transfer paper uses a regular not heat transfer for regular copy paper you'll save a lot my heat breath was not flattering [Music] probably [Music] [Music] I noticed that I've got just a little bit of that white outline showing someone go back over this with my favorite friend and that's the ability continue to go on - sure you [Music] it's a good idea to invest in a lint roller and lint roll that area I don't have a lot of [Music] so I'm just going to continue to do this and show you guys the picture to kind of give you guys an idea as you get to get to going on this fresh thing you know once I pretty much know where the print goes and I don't really use the metric package well one thing you have to realize is you see how that curling up is that when you're pressing you gotta watch out for that that makes sure that you don't get curls now I'm going to reuse this paper but the reason that I'm reusing if I am doing a black shirt I've gotta make sure that it doesn't you are my sublimation I've got to make sure that my paper does so that's one of the things that you need to watch out for when you're pressing shirt another thing is if you start to get press lines on your on your charts these are polyester shirts if you start to get press lines then you want to rip your paper that's on top of it so like for example here I don't know if you can see but there is a little press line pretty much come out [Music] a really high temperature but if you were hundreds of we'll do those press live let me get a fresh taste of fresh so they're going to do is just rip the edges of it and should they ever do that in the smooth the edges I exam you will avoid those principles so this is the last shirt I'm going to a manual inspection of each and every last one of these shirts now and since idea to this cut by hand I'm going to go in with a fabric marker and make sure that I don't have any white spots it's all about so just when it's hot put this on my pray grab a marker I just gotta [Music] [Music] fabric [Music] that [Music] like [Music] so [Music] here we have it in Canton and scale [Music] and I'm doing this very I'm just looking for I want my [Music] it's about right about 9 o'clock and I'm here all alone this morning my Bulldog to the bit [Music] my birthday lunch is my birthday month close it up stop one thing that I love about the business [Music] right time to start holiday things like that stuff like that [Music] working [Music] walk back looking at my sale [Music] updating website all of that type of stuff so in your downtime the last one we saw [Music] you know what for long term now for and [Music] 1987 was when I graduated oh I love this song [Music] my all of that stuff is so really what we're gonna do is we're about to start doing the home invasion start [Music] I'm gonna go back over and do a final pricks but again [Music] one day Oh only done one press and I didn't do this one free because I want to show people that it be explored out of the white shirt and I didn't press the back so guys that [Music] that one here that's almost [Music] now to really take your time even with with your conscience [Music] my shirt yeah Oh [Music] [Music] and the follow this order get it ready box up for the customer and get on to the next thing that I have to do state custom the appeared to be the day I make sure you got let you guys see me

and she said every time she tries the heat press some vinyl onto a t-shirt when she lifts the press up she notices that it's all gunky and gluey and sticky and the designs not smashed into the t-shirt it's pretty much sliding around and it's just a big mess from the pictures that she's shown me I asked her what kind of vinyl was she using and she replied with she was just using the vinyl that came with her vinyl cutter I think she has a cricket or cameo not exactly sure but I think she bought one of those like budget bundle deals where she buys the cutter and it comes with like a few you know twelve by twelve pieces of vinyl to practice on and test out so I think she had one of those but she thought she had heat transfer vinyl but the vinyl that was supplied was regular decal vinyl now you're asking yourself what's the difference between heat transfer vinyl and decal vinyl basically heat transfer vinyl is made to be heat transfer it onto a garment onto a t-shirt onto a hat onto whatever type of material you bought the vinyl for now let me stop right there and just say that when you're buying heat transfer vinyl you have to buy the vinyl made for the material that you're gonna be pressing on meaning if you're gonna be pressing on polyester make sure that the vinyl you buy can adhere to polyester a lot of times we'll buy some vinyl because it'll be on sale or we might not be looking at the label and it might be made for like nylon and then we go and try to press it onto a cotton t-shirt and it doesn't adhere right the settings are all backwards and messed up and we don't understand what's going on the problem is each vinyl is made for certain materials so you might get some heat transfer vinyl that's made for cotton for polyester and cotton poly blends so that's just saying that heat transfer vinyl will work on 100% cotton 100% polyester and a blend in between the two now why is this important because it's not going to adhere correctly to whatever material you're using if have a heat transfer vinyl that's made for like I said nylon and you're trying to put it onto cotton or vice versa so you have some heat transfer vinyl that's made for cotton now you're trying to put it onto some nylon bags and nylon jackets and you're melting your bags and jackets and you don't understand what's going on you have to buy the vinyl made for the materi you're gonna press on with that being said decal vinyl is the vinyl that you make stickers and car decals and like that for hydro flash car windows I mean you can stick them on anywhere but that's the regular basic decal vinyl that's not made to be heat press and it's not made for t-shirts now if you are buying vinyl by the rule on the shelf this might look normal and like oh yeah let me just get that put that on t-shirt but no this is actually decal I know it's a little bit more glossy you'll notice that there's some holes right there let's see if we get this in focus so there's holes on the side usually that tells you that this is decal vinyl you could tell by the feel it's pretty glossy most of the time heat transfer vinyls a little bit more matted and dull in color this is usually on a really big role when I go to mclogan right here in LA this is on a really big roll and I tell them let me get you know 5 yards of this 3 yards of this and they pull it out cut it and give it to me this is a 15 inch roll this is probably maybe two yards of orange this right here looks the same it's rolled up vinyl but this is actually heat transfer mine on the shelf it probably doesn't look just like this it comes in a C it'll come in like a bag similar to this there'll be some heating instructions a piece of paper in here it'll say you know what material it's made for the brand name how to apply it the instructions all of that will be on a piece of paper inside this plastic tube this is your standard 5 yard if 10 inch roll and this is heat transfer vine this right here made to put on two garments so these are made for cotton and poly blends there's no holes on the side like the other one that I just showed you color is a little bit more magic because this is the side that's gonna get stuck on to the t-shirt they look very similar like if you're buying them on Amazon you wouldn't know the difference most of the time heat transfer vinyl comes with application instructions the regular decal vinyl sometimes does sometimes doesn't but yeah that's pretty much it so hopefully if you were having that same issue and you watch my video and you see me cut some vinyl out and press it on a t-shirt you notice that the decal vinyl is not sticking on the shirt and it's kind of gumming the shirt up and you see the glue getting everywhere and like that it's a big mess that's because you're using the wrong final possibly you might be using decal vinyl when you should be using heat transfer vinyl HT v heat transfer vinyl it's usually referred to both of these on - when you see it if you wanted to buy some make sure you check the links below in my description box about a help you guys out it'll help out my channel and it's just all-around good to work with heat press nation alright catch you guys on the next one if you have any questions make sure you send it to me on Twitter at big brand Oh exactly how it's spelled out no spaces it's easier for me to just scroll through and get through to all the questions and 144 characters or whatever and I will answer them back in video form for you guys I catch you guys on next one yeah [Music]", "9Ra1fswSqJE": "hey there in today's video I'm gonna show you how I use my Sawgrass creative studio software I'm going to grab an old file that I do need to press print and press on 100% cotton shirt and most of you already know that sublimation you cannot print on 100% cotton shirts but there are several ways to accomplish that my favorite one is a powder process which I'm going to show you today so I'm gonna go ahead and log on to my Sawgrass software and it's called okay I'm gonna launch it and right now it's gonna it's gonna ask me what blank design I want and I'm just gonna click Next and I'm looking for I'm gonna do a letter size US letter ate nap by 11 next it's always gonna be white sublimation there is no white so you can start with just a blank canvas and I'm gonna be printing a vertical I mean there's that on the vertical image map 11 so I'm going to start my designer I'm gonna go to my designs and I'm gonna pull an old image there's a lot of stuff I've done since I've had this sucker software for three years I guess anyway so it's perfect if I would have added too much white that would have literally see that cut into that so you don't ever want to save an image with too much white up here you know it's not gonna print but still if you covered that that's exactly what's gonna print it's gonna cut that ringside off so I'm not so I don't want it don't know what the gloves too big because it's gonna this is gonna be a crossing chest so I want it maybe maybe five inches right here it tells you it's five by I'm sorry seven by seven right now I want it maybe five inches so that it doesn't look too too big there's a shrink this too much so let's just say about five inches okay so it's five inches squared actually this is gonna be on an excel shirt let's say for next so this is an eight nap I live in print maybe we can be seven inches just go back to other seven inches let's do six and a half up here on the left corner to telling me like what the image size is okay so here's where you see the white those are called bleed lines you don't want to go over or put you don't want your image in there and it's gonna cut off you're literally gonna cut off your image it's kind of a guideline not to go over so let's do that but this is close to the top as possible do you see the bleed lines right here you don't want your image or wording in there and I want to make this as white as possible I'm staying away from the big line if you look up here hopefully you can see it so this is gonna go on an excel shirt just solid white I kind of want to make this bigger but I want this to be across the chest I thought about doing I thought about doing this making this um heat transfer vinyl so that I can make it bigger which I probably should but it's two different processes and for a freebie you don't want to spend too much time on on this process I can make it wider to make it more pronounced again I'm trying to get avoid the bleed lines if you want please comment down below your thoughts I'm just playing around with the I think that would look okay I already have one printed it was my very first one I think I don't remember what happened but somewhere along the line the I mean I didn't place the the image correctly and when you're using powder for your pressing your print on your press you have to be really careful once you place it because once you put it down because it's powder that it's soaking up the ink once you put it down that's it you have to leave it down or it's gonna mess up your humor process I think I want to leave it like that I think that looks looks okay maybe shrink it just a little bit maybe let's make it six inches I'm just trying to imagine what it will look like on an XL shirt normally I would put it that close but again we're working with a freebie right now just for the guys just gonna be using it for boxing boxing shirt okay so let's say we want to Center it I'm gonna highlight both click on object and align Center right so it's a line now so okay now so now what I'm going to do is I've been imprinted on sublimation I'm sorry the powder comes with its own toilet tone paper from SEPs and I'm gonna show you that process now I'm getting ready to print that first I want to show you I put my process my powder in this in this container it's uh it's a one and a half gallon Rubbermaid container and we're gonna have it this big is because I want to be able to fit my paper like at 1111 an 11 inch by 17 inch is the longest either way I want to I want enough room to put the paper in there and I'll show you what I'm going to do they look they did their paper just so that people know which side to print on this one had a little wine on it probably cut that out I'm gonna go ahead and use this I'll just cut that out if I don't need it and I'll show you what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go ahead and stick this in mind this is my soccer X it's 200 try to face down let me stick them on print the image you do have to select which paper and because it does not give you an option for four steps in a virtuosic creative studio I've been choosing the option of I still select you know sub products and for the paper I just pick a key plot no idea what that is to be honest but it works and I keep it on high quality waiting for it to print I don't need that much powder this is gonna be plenty usually there comes a little baggie like that I don't put it back I just close the seal the literally tightly and I just leave it there until the next time I use it because ink is what if you touch it you're ruined the print so do not touch the ink just be careful and just hang on to it just just grab the edges and avoid touch them to eat I learned the hard way okay so what I'm gonna do you can still wet now grab to eat the paper and just slowly just move the the powder in there grab the ends and I'm just gonna kind of sway back and forth so there's one one time and then I did one last time and that's it I just tap it just like that I also have this little comb brush that I bought just to get any excess powder because you will have to put it under the your heat press for about 30 seconds to secure it so I'm gonna do that process now okay for the temperature settings they have to be 375 Fahrenheit 30 seconds since it's fresh off the press and still wet when you use a piece of parchment paper because there is gonna be powder in the back and that's what the brush silicone brush was for but I went ahead and use my hands just to get any excess out and I'm just gonna set it down I'm waiting for the temperature to get to three seventy-five once that's once I've reached that temperature I mean just let it hover over the image and just let it cure for 30 seconds and then from there I'm going to show you the the pressing process I didn't mention you have to use moderate pressure and it is for 30 seconds once you've done that you have to it's a cold pill so you have to wait about 40 seconds before you remove the transfer so I wanted to add that really quick before I forget this shirt appears a medium-sized shirt this was the very first shirt I print a while back I mean it's then it has been a good maybe a couple years and I can't see it and I want to take this shirt off but I have this as my sample for evening for showing people the sublimation to cutting process which is this powder process I somehow didn't place it correctly and it's it's kind of off in some areas but here didn't pick up the ink and that's why I decided to just keep this I used a sharpie pick just for so looking for display I don't know if you can see about you'll be able to see once I show you now use a sharpie see the black mark I just did that because I wanted to keep it for Show and Tell for sublimation to patent that's why I still have this plus it looks good I mean it's good to have shirts for your process for show-and-tell not what people can see the different processes that you know I would turn the camera but I don't want to have to I'm using the octopus one and I won't have to readjust it but eventually I'll show you all the shirts that I have them hanging on the walls that I use a show and tell the pressure is already at 6:56 362 which that's hot enough so for now I'm just gonna go ahead and cure my in so again it has to hover for about 30 seconds to let it cure and all it's doing is just keeping the moisture it's removing moisture and it's also curing the ink with the powder and you can feel it you can't feel it it really just feels like heat transfer vinyl okay that's about 30 seconds I didn't really count maybe about five more seconds okay so it's out don't touch it I wish I had a handle to do this I'll bring it in close I don't know if you can see it but it's kind of got a like a velvety kind of look to it I would say feel but you can't feel it but he's got a velvety look to it and if you remember a little while ago I mentioned that it had a little smudge or something on I'm gonna go to cut that out I don't want that to end up on my shirt so I'm just gonna cut it out and I'm fixing to I'm fixing to go ahead and take the moisture out of my t-shirt these are white of course this I'm gonna go into these my lint roller you still have to be careful not to touch touch the the image same thing [Music] try not to be camera I'm using a Hanes t-shirt turn it to the camera too much it's gonna move the moisture out of the t-shirt my my my tripod broke my big one my 50 inch tripod it broke got the pressure too hard I'm gonna go ahead and find my center line I'm gonna fold it in half vertically just suck and create my center line my image and I do have this and one of my videos how to find your center line has a kink in there and trying to get out I don't want that I want to get him as far as possible like I did something wrong sorry I know I'm off-camera just trying to find my centerline doesn't let me take this long and also when I look at when I'm you trying to find my centerline the caller when we slowed it in half you can feel the caller I always put the collar off of the edge of the heat press only because I don't want the I don't want the collar imprinted on the on the [Music] on the other side of the shirt if that makes any sense okay that's good for now just going to apply the pressure line to close it just to avoid the camera being so shaky okay now on you can't you can't find the you can't bend it like you normally would he transfer vinyl there you know you pinch the top and the bottom but you can't do it on these because you know you don't want to ruin the the image because it's powdered so what I've been doing there's my centerline look you can see it there you go there's my centerline and again this is an XL shirt I'm gonna do four inches I'm just gonna put a little indention with my nail and I'm gonna get the color off the press or the Putney so what I do because this is I know this is eight at eight and a half by eleven I just find the four and a half inch mark with my ruler or my tape measure normally what I do and I do this way before time I just get it like an exact don't know if you can't use a pen or marker of course you don't want that on his shirt I just he's a either an exacto knife or I'll just mark it with the scissors I know it seems like a lot of different steps but for me it's worth it I'm just gonna make a little make a little mark with my scissors again the wrong reason I'm doing that is because I don't want to touch it and I'm just gonna make little Mark's and just to show you my markers right there my scissor mark so four and a half inches plus another one of inches actually I'm more fiction is I don't wanna to off okay so right there right there right doesn't have to be perfect but that's just me okay and the reason you want to do this is because it's powder once you put it down that's it there's no turning back but regardless I still love this process because I'm able to print on one or any cotton-blend shirt okay so I've got my mark I'm gonna line these up with the center line that I created okay so once they're fine cinnamon I just drop it very carefully and I do use um parchment paper for this for sublimation you do not want to use Teflon sheets because it will pick up any of the ink and I will you will transfer that to your next substrate so I always use parchment paper when I'm working with sublimation okay so we're gonna do 30 seconds and then we have to wait 40 seconds before we can remove the transfer to the transfer paper so we have about seven seconds left if you want to share what process you use for sublimation please drop that below so we can share information maybe I can give you some tips that you have any questions please feel free to drop your questions down below you have to wait 40 seconds I'm not gonna need this because that's the cup steps instructions I'm gonna wait about 40 seconds turn it's been 40 seconds and it is Coquille I hope you can see this I want to call the image when I press it one more time just so I can remove these lines this is a civil mission - cotton okay I hope this video was helpful feel free to ask questions and I look forward to producing more videos for you thank you for watching until the next time", "bdZ9A9WLwZg": "So I came down to this conclusion in my life\nand I said to myself, you know what? I need a good t-shirt for an everyday fit\nme before active wear or maybe just for like an undershirt type of purpose, depending on\nwhat I'm wearing. That day is a various collections of shirts\nthat you guys need to know about, so it's going to be a little different than anything\nyou've ever seen. The first thing you wouldn't be talking about\nis. Fit, texture, wear ability, and then we're\ntalking about a wrinkle test. Let's go. What's going on guys? Welcome back to arc away a new direction of\na modern man. My name is mr Lou and today we're looking\nat the best white t-shirts. First thing we'll be talking about is fit,\ntexture, wear ability, and then we've talked about a wrinkle test. I'm going to get into this video for you guys. I'm going to basically wear the shirt. I'm telling you guys how it fuels and when\nyou go down for the list, marking them off the board for sure they have off the rack\nis from Simon's. This is Amelia. It is tight around the arms. I got to say that off the bat. So around my biceps here, it's snugly like\nI barely have room to even breathe. It just feels like Alaska guys just wrapped\naround my arms. That's what it feels like around the chest\nis a little tight around here. The pet Torres. But when they come in down to my torso is\na little looser along the frame here. It's a little constructed around my armpits\nhere, and I don't like that feeling. I like the feeling of it being a little bit\nlooser. I can feel a lot of the material right under\nmy armpits. So for this, the type of work bility I wear\nfor this tee shirt will typically be probably like under a bomber or. Or under like a long sleeve shirt. Like this is type of shirt. I'll probably wear something over top of it\ncause I don't really feel like this is something I would typically wear a loosey goosey, just\nlike rigid pair of jeans. Um, typically for me, if it's a little tighter\naround my body, then I'll typically wear something over it. Most wrinkles on this does stay in the same\nposition, isn't really get away from like being recalled free. Or maybe you come across shirts or say iron\nfree. This one's . Still has numerous refills. Next should I have right here is from top\nman and taught man has a nice quality of shirts. This one ranges for $15 in the white shirt,\nso I'm a fro this on and see what this feels like. The fit of this shirt is very comfortable. It actually has a lot more room to grieve. To me, this is like the best shirts so far. The fit of this actually gives me a lot more\nroom. It's a lot more comfortable. It's a lot more of my style. So this is the type of shirt I'll definitely\nwear it for a pair of jeans or wear some shorts. Maybe we go to the beach even where they swoop\na blazer over top. And this is something I feel a lot more comfortable\nand it's a lot more breathable all around. It didn't state that it was organic or, no,\nit was taught men. It's just, this is called the in, um, the\nfit of it is quite closer to ganache, but fuels. Quite nice on a skin around the arms and shoulders\nis not constraining like before the wearability of this, like it just mentioned where for\nblazer, where, where were some shorts to the beach. This is the good basic white shirt. This is something I'll keep in my Central's\nin a closet in rotation. So this is something you guys should acquire. And now I want to do the wrinkle test with\nthis. So misses, scrunch it up just like before\nand you're going to get some wrinkles, but some of it doesn't carry on until it's like\nundone completely. All around. This is a good shirt. This is a decent shirt, in my opinion. This is a shirt from Totman. So this ranges for $15 so next shirt is from\nGuruji. So this one right here, it was two for 15\nbucks. So that's a good deal on the price Mark. But let's check all the quality of this Moogy\nshirt. This is actually a large, all around the fit\nis very similar to talk men, which I had on before, but all in all, it's not, it doesn't\nsuffocate me on the arms. So that is good. They, I can't see, I can't feel any difference,\nto be honest with you. This is States that it's 20, 20% polyester\nand an 80% cotton. Um, I can honestly feel difference between\nboth of them, but me, if I switch over to Totman or fuels. Slight, but it doesn't bother me at this point\nin time. Um, I completely am fine with this wearability\nof this. This is something I would consider for me\nmore or less an undershirt. So when it comes down to the wrinkle test\nfor this, I noticed when I did put it on it, it did have this weird clump around there. And I noticed maybe it was just, maybe it's\njust based on like licensed stain or something. But let me just see something. Let me just scrunch it up. It's not as bad as I'm sure she seen before. But, and notice he does have this gritty clumping\naround these shirts and you know, it has like these clumps of like these waves of clumps\nin your shirt. That's what it actually is kind of showing\nright now. And it's kind of weird, but, but Hey, and\nso it's all right for what it is. It's from Uniclo. This goes for $9. Let's call it $10 he just goes for $10 and\nit kind of feels like the first shirt ever. I put it on. So it kinda is like this, honestly the same. What did, what was this one? Simon's? Yeah. It's kinda like, it's kinda like that. It's actually tight around the arms again,\nyou got, again, this is typically would be worn as like an undershirt, but the, the. The fit is snug. It's a little looser around the torso. Actually the pet Taurus is a little looser\nhere, but yet again the arms, something about a T shirt tucks around my arm. It really bothers me. I don't know. Sure why, but it just, I just don't like that\nfeeling. I like to have a feeling I'm feeling a little\nbit loose. It States that it's caught in a, I do believe\nthere's little last thing in here cause I can just tell by the pull of it sometimes,\nbut it's not too bad. I like it the textile wise. So rentability of this. So when it comes down to this wrinkle test,\nI'm gonna switch this up a little bit. Boom, us and us, they wrinkles actually fade\nout pretty well with this shirt, which is quite surprising because a lot of these shirts\nI did test before, Ashley's a lot more wrinkles than before. If you're looking for and shared that she\nhas very smooth look to it and then you want to stress about your game wrinkled so much,\nit would go for this type of shirt. It might work for you. And this would keep in mind with any shirts\nthat I do demo here cause different purposes. Super different shirts. So don't assume that this one shirt is best\nfor any type of purpose. Like going to the gym, maybe under shirt,\na tee shirt for a wedding, or you just maybe go, no for lunch. The girlfriend, it doesn't matter. But that's the end of the day. Every shirt has their own purpose. So I won't carry a guy's this as an all around\nbest shirt, but they're all meant for different things. So the next year I had right here is from\nbanana Republic. It is a size medium. Some are photos on. This actually feels more in between where\nit was loose, but at the same time it has a balance of being tight. So it was a good combination where you find\nthis t-shirt right here, banana Republic in a happy medium. Uh, for me around the shoulders, it's a little\nlooser than before. So you guys know before, like I don't like\ntightness on the shirts. And this one actually provides a little bit\nmore loose fuel to it around the torso. It comes off, it's like a slim fit. And look, this is 100% cotton. This is in a medium. So banana Republic, I put this at a high regard\nregarding pie, the second best t-shirt that I like. Oh, does this collection, this type of wear\nBilly for the shirt would be, you'd probably be for any type of occasion, to be honest\nwith you, like this is something that I'll keep as mind Central's nature to have is each\nnumber long fit shirt. So it does have a little bit of . Oop. Here at the bottom. Did she show you guys? She saw you guys. That scoop screw is the Jersey basic shirt\nand it goes for 1299 this year. Right here it has this scoop like I just showed\nyou guys before. So this is type of shirt that actually fits\npretty well. If you're more of an active type, if you're\nmore of a lifestyle outdoors type of person, where you want to kick it in with a little\nbit of style. If you're not on the trendy side of things\nand you just want something that maybe a little different than the rest. Cause it is a scoop and that had a fad. But who knows. It could be coming back within that eight\nyear cycle screw. But for the shirt all around the fit of it\nis quite nice. I don't mind it at all. Actually. A good mixing between slim fit and fitted,\nand this actually is nice. We're on a torso, torso. I can't complain. It's a nice narrow cut. It's kind of a little bit tailor fitted in\na sense, but this is all around a nice lifestyle tab. The tee shirt with a modern twist to it. Scoop. And, um, yeah, I like this. I identity that. If it's not a bad shirt, I like it. Okay. So this year I have, one is from H, and. M. it is the premium car insurance. This actually goes for 1999. The Fisher off the bat is tight. Like it's super tight. Like, I don't know. Like, I shouldn't have got this small, but\nI did get a small, but I can see where it could like go from here. So if I emulated from what I had before, the\nmedium is not going to fit too much in it is the medium is not gonna fit. Not much different than this based on how\nthis fuels already. So the fit of this is quite tight. All around. It's suffocating me. This is something that I probably won't even\nwear, to be honest, cause it's just so uncomfortable around the arms. But if you do like your shirts tight, then\nboom. Get yourself a premium cotton shirt from H\nand M for 1999 and if that's not your budgeting and going into something a little more different\nfrom the selection I provided the guys with. But also when it comes down to texture, texture\nis par. This is probably the best texture I had of\nall the shirts so far. So that's the plus side. So for the price point of this shirt is 19\n1999 so based on quality of the shirt is premium quality. Kai in so. You're going to get the best texture of all\nthese shirts combined. So this wise, it does feel amazing. I can't lie about that. But if this is when it comes down to fit is\nreally tight, but keep in mind, I am wearing a small, so if I emulate that and I go into\nthe other shirts, if this was a medium or. Possibly a larger, what actually worked for\nme. But if there's the medium, it still might\nbe a little too tight for me. So in that regards, I have to dismiss this\nfrom the collection. Even though I do love the texture of this,\nI won't justify this for buying for 1999 but for someone who does like these quality type\nof shirts, all means go for it. So here is the regulatory. Fit shirt from H. and. M. we're going for seven 99 the fit of this\nis amazing. I don't feel constraint around my arms. The Torisel is loose enough, but it same time\nas breathable and go all around, feel it. This does not hurt the pocket price wise and\nit does not hurt my body in a sense of being suffocated. So when it comes down to this shirt, I think\nthis is one of my, probably my fourth best shirt on his list here. Um, I'm not talking just about the price when\nI'm talking about the quality of the shirt altogether based on what I've put on and how\nI feel about it. So, so first thing for us to fit of it is\ngood. Why just cover it? The texture wise, it is. Quite soft. It is 100% cotton. I don't see much difference. I don't see much difference beyond the premium\nquality cotton of the other previous H&M shirt for 1999 that did feel like a crazy difference\nin, so this strain is close, close to the bar. Um, the next thing I'll get into is the word\nyou. This is, this is the everyday shirt off the\nbat. Where anywhere you go. If you need white shirt, this proton, it's\nthere for you. You're going to go test watch. I'm going to do and demonstrate here something\nto wrinkle up a little bit. Uh, the wrinkle test isn't too bad on this\nshirt. I do enjoy what it looks like and how it fuels. Um, it doesn't have a lot of crazy lines into\nit. Like it did happen with a few of these, especially\nwith the wave patterns. So this is the, probably one of the best shirts. Oh, of the bunch eyes. Just to wrap it all up, I must tell you guys\nthe best t-shirts that I feel fit for my liking. The first one I'll go for is a top man isn't\na large, and that goes for $15 the second one I recommend is the banana Republic. I got on sell for $10 retail is about 30 and\nthen the third will be the H and M long shirt. That's. That is going forward. 1299 and then the fourth one would be the\nbasic standard shirt, which I have on right now from H and M go for seven 99 so those\nare actually my top four favorite white teas of the whole collection here. They've got so much for watching this video. I appreciate the love and support. Almost forgot the question today, guys, is\nwhat type of white shirt have you owned in the past and what type of way shirt do you\nguys recommend. I want to know what you guys thought.

We'll check you soon at CoedMonkey.com. You're going to love this thing, feel the\ndifference today.", "BiSYoeqb_VY": "Consider the classic white t-shirt. Annually, we sell and buy\ntwo billion t-shirts globally, making it one of the most common\ngarments in the world. But how and where is the average\nt-shirt made, and what's its environmental impact? Clothing items can vary a lot, but a typical t-shirt begins its life\non a farm in America, China, or India where cotton seeds are sown, irrigated and\ngrown for the fluffy bolls they produce. Self-driving machines carefully harvest\nthese puffs, an industrial cotton gin mechanically\nseparates the fluffy bolls from the seeds, and the cotton lint is pressed \ninto 225-kilogram bales. The cotton plants require a huge quantity\nof water and pesticides. 2,700 liters of water are needed to produce\nthe average t-shirt, enough to fill more than 30 bathtubs. Meanwhile, cotton uses more insecticides\nand pesticides than any other crop in the world. These pollutants can be carcinogenic, harm the health of field workers, and damage surrounding ecosystems. Some t-shirts are made of organic cotton\ngrown without pesticides and insecticides, but organic cotton makes up less than 1% of the 22.7 million metric tons \nof cotton produced worldwide. Once the cotton bales leave the farm, textile mills ship them\nto a spinning facility, usually in China or India, where high-tech machines blend, card, comb, pull, stretch, and, finally, twist the cotton into\nsnowy ropes of yarn called slivers. Then, yarns are sent to the mill, where huge circular knitting machines weave them into sheets \nof rough grayish fabric treated with heat and chemicals\nuntil they turn soft and white. Here, the fabric is dipped into\ncommercial bleaches and azo dyes, which make up the vivid coloring\nin about 70% of textiles. Unfortunately, some of these contain\ncancer-causing cadmium, lead, chromium, and mercury. Other harmful compounds and chemicals\ncan cause widespread contamination when released as toxic waste water\nin rivers and oceans. Technologies are now so advanced\nin some countries that the entire process of growing\nand producing fabric barely touches a human hand. But only up until this point. After the finished cloth \ntravels to factories, often in Bangladesh, China, India,\nor Turkey, human labor is still required \nto stitch them up into t-shirts, intricate work that \nmachines just can't do. This process has its own problems. Bangladesh, for example, which has surpassed China as the world's\nbiggest exporter of cotton t-shirts, employs 4.5 million people\nin the t-shirt industry, but they typically face poor conditions\nand low wages. After manufacture, all those t-shirts\ntravel by ship, train, and truck to be sold in high-income countries, a process that gives cotton \nan enormous carbon footprint. Some countries produce \ntheir own clothing domestically, which cuts out this polluting stage, but generally, apparel production accounts\nfor 10% of global carbon emissions. And it's escalating. Cheaper garments and the public's\nwillingness to buy boosted global production \nfrom 1994 to 2014 by 400% to around 80 billion garments each year. Finally, in a consumer's home, the t-shirt goes through one of the most\nresource-intensive phases of its lifetime. In America, for instance, the average household does nearly\n400 loads of laundry per year each using about 40 gallons of water. Washing machines and dryers \nboth use energy, with dryers requiring five to six times\nmore than washers. This dramatic shift in clothing \nconsumption over the last 20 years, driven by large corporations\nand the trend of fast fashion has cost the environment, the health of farmers, and driven questionable \nhuman labor practices. It's also turned fashion into the second\nlargest polluter in the world after oil. But there are things we can do. Consider shopping secondhand. Try to look for textiles made from\nrecycled or organic fabrics. Wash clothes less and line dry\nto save resources. Instead of throwing them away\nat the end of their life, donate, recycle, or reuse them\nas cleaning rags. And, finally, you might ask yourself, how many t-shirts and articles of clothing\nwill you consume over your lifetime, and what will be their combined \nimpact on the world?", "OGDhx9fpP88": "hey guys it's becky with design bundles and today i'm going to talk to you about bleached t-shirts now this is not necessarily a new craze but these always flare up around the fall and you know why that is because they make nice distressed designs okay distressed fall they really go hand in hand so now is the time if you have not done so already grab your bleach grab your t-shirt and let's go ahead and get started okay so here i am on designbundles.net and i scored myself this really awesome leopard or cheetah print uh pumpkin okay and of course i i'm really loving let me show you guys this up close i'm really loving this um cheetah leopard print and the hearts so of course i had to grab it too so i have my pattern and i have my pumpkin and i'm going to go ahead and purchase these so that we can get started okay now once i'm in silhouette studio now you can do this in any designing software it's completely up to you but i'm going to set these up to be sublimation prints so i'm going to go to file and merge because i already have a window open so i can merge instead of i'm going to open like normal and i've already unzipped these you guys saw me do that so i'm going to i like to use the png formats and i want to use is that the pink one i'm going to use this orange one here now they usually import pretty large so if it takes a minute don't be alarmed all right so this one is not bad at all i am going to shrink it down just a little bit and i also want to merge in my pumpkin let's see jpeg and png i do like to use the png those usually have a transparent background it doesn't matter for this in particular but it could matter in the future now i know probably what you're thinking the pattern and the pumpkin don't match up very well that's okay because it's not going to be that big of a deal once we get to the actual project so what i like to do is this is going on an adult large shirt so i'm going to size it and i also need to change my page setup because i will be printing on a large format as a matter of fact let me set the custom okay can i go 13 inches wide i'm going to change my machine to none there we go 13 by 19. okay this is the size that i'm going to print and i want my pumpkin to be let's say let's do 9 inches now i do want to say this is going to be a little bit smaller than 9 inches because it's measuring the outside borders here so what i can do if that concerns me is i can draw a box that is nine inches line that up with my pumpkin and then i can size my pumpkin manually so that it's closer to the nine inch mark so my clipboard is actually nine point eight four seven that's okay that's not a big deal just something to know when you're using clip art and i am going to go ahead and flip it horizontally okay so with that in place what i'm going to do is i am going to make this pattern a little bit larger and i'm also going to duplicate it now the only reason i'm doing that is because i do want to have longer pieces and i want to use up the rest of my space down here now silhouette studio will only print what is on the page so just something to keep in mind make sure everything is on there and i'm literally going to fill up the rest of the area with this awesome cheetah pattern i keep saying cheetah is it cheetah or is it leopard all right so i'm going to print now i do have to select my sublimation printer see there we go i'm going to go to preferences and every time that i print after restarting my software i need to re-choose my super b 13 by 9 and 13 by 19 i mean and then premium presentation paper matte i'm going to choose okay hit apply and then i can hit print that's going to send over to my printer and of course we will reconvene and i'm going to show you not only pressing this on the shirt but then applying the bleaching process okay so what i have here is my sublimation print now this is the shirt that i'm going to use this is a style that i really like especially this orange it is a gildan soft style and it is 65 polyester and that leaves 35 cotton now there are reasons why you want to use a blended shirt like this first of all you need the cotton or to be able to bleach it second of all you need the polyester in order to be able to sublimate it but do remember that because you're not subbing on 100 polyester your print is not going to be as bright now for a bleach shirt that's fine and that's why we're doing the bleach so that you can see the design a little bit better but just be prepared for that now i'm going to trim all the way around all right now that is because sometimes and i find this a lot with sublimation printers you can get a little bit of ink around the outside of your paper and i would rather not have that happen so i just trimmed around each side and we will sublimate this part first and of course i have some butcher paper over here so what you're seeing down here on the bottom is just a heat safe mat that i have i'm going to grab my cricut easy press it is already heated up to 400 degrees for 60 seconds i'm going to fold my shirt in half it's kind of my thing i mean not my thing it's a thing okay that way i can get a crease before i sublimate my design on there so here we go i'm just going to pre-press that section and it doesn't have to be for the full time you just want to press it get some of the moisture out of there and give yourself that nice pressing line and just works out really good it's a good habit to have okay with that taken care of i will smooth this out and i'm going to go ahead and sublimate first yes you heard that correctly i'm going to sublimate my design first now i'm going to take my design now this is a design that i printed sometimes you can get them pre-printed from certain areas okay if you want you can use an adhesive to keep it here i'm not moving this shirt so this will be fine for me i'm going to cover it with butcher paper and then heat press my design now sublimation does not take a lot of pressure but you do need consistent pressure another good thing about these bleach shirts is that if this is one of your first time sublimating then it doesn't have to come out perfect because bleach shirts are supposed to look distressed so it just works out really good as a beginner project okay now be careful when opening your heat press or removing your ez press because since we did not use any type of adhesive or heat safe tape we do not want this design to shift okay so on this part we are a done deal now you cannot reuse this butcher paper you see you have the ink on there that transferred and that's okay just know that that's a thing all right there is our beautiful pumpkin now what we want to do and i'm going to start small just to show you guys i'm actually going to tear around this design okay because i do not want it to look like um just a rectangle obviously i actually prefer these to look like stripes all right so there's one we can use this one for another one and it just gives it a rough edge instead of just a bland okay and of course i have this entire sheet over here that i can do the same thing to i can make these a little larger and i probably don't even need all of these i tear them into little triangles and i'm not going to use the ones with the blunt edges like that okay so i can use as many of these or as few of these as i want to i'm just going to go around the shirt and press these on now let me also say if i was using a different shirt especially a white shirt or a light gray shirt you do want to use butcher paper or a different type of blowout paper in between your shirt layers i don't have to do that with this one i've worked with this one before and it is not going to bleed through to the back but just something to keep in mind and i like to do that kind of test anytime [Music] i'm working with a new shirt you do want to make sure you get some along the bottom now my shirt just my shirts seem to bunch so i'm just going to put some off to the side over here now our sublimating is done all right this is our our final effect we got a couple stripes up here and a couple stripes down here all right now don't worry if they look a little staged after the bleaching process they will blend in a little bit more and i promise this shirt is going to turn out great so i'm going to go ahead and prep the bleaching area and then i'll show you guys the setup that i use okay so the basics are you need it to be sunny outside obviously you don't want to be raining you need good weather conditions you also need a bleach safe environment now on top of just this piece of hardboard that i have you'll notice that i'm inserting a piece of cardboard into my shirt that's just going to act as a barrier so that whenever i spray especially the main middle pumpkin there it's not going to saturate through my shirt all the way to the back in addition to that make sure you're wearing bleach safe clothes in my video there was a little bit of wind blowing and i didn't have any blow back but that is a real possibility that you could blow the bleach that you spray back on the clothes you're wearing i also try to give my shirt a little bit of character so you'll notice i have done the pinch and twist on three of the areas and that's just going to give some areas where the bleach cannot reach and it just gives it a little bit of texture now i'm using straight bleach this is also cheap bleach i have heard that the high-powered bleach is more potent so definitely keep that in mind and i'm spraying all the areas that i have sublimated on including i'm trying to carefully go around my pumpkin and make sure i get that area really really well but you're going to notice that i give it a pretty good overall spray down i don't really well it's not that i don't like them i personally am not a fan of creating the shirts that just have the block of bleach right there in the middle and nothing else so i just really think that adding more bleach gives it some character you see i do a little bit of misting here now if you want some true misting you'll want to make sure to choose a spray bottle that has a really fine mist i'm going to come back and do that in just a minute i like to do my bleaching in stages so i'm doing one overall bleach right now and then i will actually come back and add a little bit more bleach in just a minute wow did you notice the change there so i had set it up on a time lapse but the gradual change wasn't quite as impactful so um it did occur now that probably took about five minutes what i'm doing is i'm going back and i'm re-saturating the areas where i've sublimated and this is with a a smaller bottle so i have more control over where i'm spraying and i'm going to let this sit for just a minute but another important thing to remember is when you take this inside you do want to at a minimum rinse it with cold water and then some people talk about also adding peroxide to neutralize the bleach i haven't had to do that but it's just something to keep in mind if you are in the mood to experiment but also as you're carrying it inside make sure that you do not dislodge the cardboard piece inside because your shirt will still be wet and also make sure that you don't brush the shirt up against your clothing because obviously it's covered in bleach so overall just try to keep an eye on your shirt and after you see a little bit of the transformation you can also straighten it out flatten it out and you know take a look i like to do that because it gives me a better idea of how the bleach process is going because i can compare my bleached area against the unexposed areas and see how much change there really was now here we are on the inside i have already rinsed this with cold water i feel like i got pretty good results on my bleach shirt you can see i got a pretty good bleach around the design okay and i don't like it when it's just a plain circle right in the middle of your t-shirt i do like these lighter colors i think they bleach really well and it's not a stark contrast so i'm very happy with how this turned out and i'm going to throw it through the washer and dryer and then we will take another look so uh do you like it i mean i i'm not gonna lie not everybody is with the bleach shirt craze all right that's okay there's no judgment in this zone this is the safe zone okay now if you like it you kind of get addicted to it pretty fast and if you live in florida like me then you know having all the sunshiny days to sweat your ear off bleaching shirts i mean it just depends on how you feel about that so all right well i really appreciate you watching today if you have any questions or comments make sure you leave them below and i will come back in and check with you guys but also make sure you subscribe to the channel because we have a lot of really fun tutorials for you right around the corner thanks again we'll see you next time you",

of that stuff I recommend for you to subscribe so on that note today we are switching it up just a little bit and I have some comparisons that I've been wanting to do so I've waited about a week and a half to do this to make this video and what this is all about is oversized t-shirt I've recently kind of got back into oversized t-shirts which kind of just look like baggy shirts from back in the day except the cut is just a little bit different but today we're gonna be comparing minimal to all style okay and more specifically it is the 1301 style for all style and it is the drop tee or oversized tee for minimal it I'm pretty sure it's called drop tee but there's so many names for this like oversized t-shirt but I'm pretty sure to drop to you right on their website as we speak now if you're interested in the old style right off the bat all styles are always available there on Amazon their own eBay they're on all different types of blank websites as far as minimal girls I don't my guess is that this is something that they have all year round but it can also not be something that they have all year round unfortunately enough I have a size large and an extra large and a 13:01 and for the minimal I have a white enlarge and then I have a size medium in the black and the reason why I have black color is because they ran out of size medium and white so I have to compromise okay and how we're gonna format this video is that I'm just going to try them on give you my raw opinion of it and then afterwards I'm gonna give you some measurements and then kind of answer some questions at the very end and then wrap up the video the first one I'm gonna try on is the size large in the white from minimal before I even try this on I'm gonna be honest with you this thing looks huge this thing looks massive but let's give it a shot are really huge but ii thought too thick not too thin but this is wow this is huge dude Oh Dawg Dawg I'm swimming dude oh my god big man this is too big this is way too big to size large and most t-shirts but like this's I understand it's a drop tea but God can't see my elbows man without being said let's try on the medium for minimal perhaps the same material all right so this is doable and doable size medium of the minimal drop tea though I recommend I already recommend buy a size down from the minimal drop teas or an oversized t-shirt this is exactly what I'd be looking for I think that how to buy like a regular sized t-shirt that is not a drop teat it would just be too long on the bottom if it's oversized so it's nice that it kind of it kind of stops a little early compared to most just regular t-shirts I guess let's go ahead and try on the old style so this is a size large which isn't bad this kind of just fits exactly like because it's 1601 or just a regular adult team it's not bad I do wish that the sleeves came down a little bit longer since that being said let's try on the extra large with a extra large is just way too big I was saying earlier with regular size t-shirts this is kind of like a regular size t-shirt got this specific style recommended to me from another youtuber which I'll try to link up in description if I find it again he said 1301 is a good for oversized t-shirt but right now I'm gonna say that this is a no like this is huge oh mighty like this is a very big shirt alrighty and I got some pretty skinny sweats on right now I just I look like I'm stuck back in 2003 [Music] like this is not this is not it man this is really big I mean if he came up just a little bit more they'd be cut off like right here area it probably would have worked but this is just it's too big man I don't ok so just very quick on paracin that we have here so we got the minimal here obviously they do a lot more brand heavy stuff for their garments so you got your minimal tag here which is pretty cool and then they give you this tag as well the minimal one I paid about 20 bucks you also want to get about 10 dollars but this material is a lot better I think the black one that I'm wearing right now that I was just showing you guys that one I don't know why but it feels better than this white one that they made but again the material this one's a lot better now their white is a little see-through I know it's hard to tell because though my white light right now is shining directly on top of it but in real life put this on and then you have a pair of pants on or something like that or something more reviewing on the inside it's gonna show something dark it's gonna show which is a little unfortunate but as far as all foul that won't happen to you because their garments are pretty thick as it is but that's kind of arguably where all style kind of is a little disappointing sometimes is because sometimes I wear all style and it's like really cold outside and it works because it's kind of thick but then sometimes it's really hot outside and I don't want to wear an all style t-shirt because it's just too it's too much it just it doesn't feel as comfortable as something like this that's like a little bit thinner I don't know if I want to say better quality but it's it's softer and a thinner and air runs through it a little bit better air doesn't always run through an all style t-shirt as well as it should but I'm a little disappointed in this all style I thought it was going to come and gonna kind of fit like a drop tee but it didn't end up fitting like a drum - you just ended up fitting like a regular adult all style t-shirt which I don't personally like I don't and I'm not that fond of that the caller's are very very different - with the minimal you got this like collar that is a lot softer obviously from an all style all style collars tend to be a little bit rough sometimes this is a lot softer but the drawback with these type of like minimal collars is that if you wash it too many times they get a little crinkly and and it just it feels funky man just to be very honest it feels kind of weird after a while and it feels very used either right now it's good obviously cuz it's brand new now these cup of college they'll last you a long time but they're not always the most comfortable colors in the world they're very thick and like I meant it in the summertime it could be a little too thick now to my understanding I believe all style is made here in the US if I'm not mistaken it could also be made in China and then imported here and you know however they do that but my guess from the materials that I see on the minimal I haven't even looked yet but they're my guest of the materials on the minimal it's got to be from Pakistan maybe China but probably Pakistan or somewhere in the Middle East quick let me see if they have tag on the inside here as I suspected made in India now I don't know what it is about this specific material and also these type of collars I've ordered a lot of blanks myself with my own clothing brand name and like looking into different manufacturers that make it different types of collars and materials and I don't know why but this material just it just speaks either China or India or Pakistan to me and I was kind of like dead-on right on the money with that I mean you should be either determinant of which one kind of fits you best okay so you're gonna do some very quick measurement wean all style here and minimal these are both a size large got the height thirty inches and for the minimal 29 to 30 inches now if we take the width of this t-shirt about 21 inches and be minimal is coming in about 25 significant difference the minimal is almost two and a half to three inches wider than your all style if we take the measurement of caller to the sleeve you have about 16 inches here and collar to the sleeve there's about 19 inches cut on this is obviously a lot better to achieve the oversized look and the all style isn't doing so hot I remember that these are both size large and also remember that all style you know they didn't purposely make this t-shirt to be an oversized t-shirt or oversized fit but remember minimal they are meant to be an oversized fit I recommend whatever your true to size is go one size down in this and if you really want the whole style then go one size up and then maybe you can tailor it later to fit yourself you know better but this one is pretty off to the actual look that we're trying to achieve today I don't know okay closing the video out I will say that minimal had blown this one out of the water but I mean it almost came to no surprise that minimal was better than the all styles because you know all styles the purpose of the all style was is not supposed to be an oversized t-shirt I mean you could buy one size up depending on your body type or whatever if I was a little bit taller then yeah the XL would have worked for me but the the large just felt like a regular ol style t-shirt large like an adult t-shirt large which I don't like that sizing of that right now and then the extra large just felt huge you just felt massive no different than the size large in the minimal that one also felt massive but the medium that I have on is a perfect size I like how much it kind of covers the elbows a little bit but to achieve that oversized look and 20 bucks for the t-shirt it does feel like a lot of money to buy one shirt for a blank shirt for twenty dollars but minimal does a pretty decent job at there are some other brand names that do do it too but this was the only one that was kind of more accessible towards me towards online so I happen to buy the minimal and I thought I'd do the comparison today so hopefully this video was helpful don't say I want to say this now all style is not a cheaper alternative as of what I think about the 13:01 if somebody knows a another style number that is a good comparable style words fit or cut to an oversized t-shirt better than 1301 now please message me I would love to know which one that one is or another brand I would love to do another comparison so anyways closing this out make sure you guys keep it lock right here for all your latest information for music fashion to culture it is your boy

done it before the video hits about fifty five thousand eight so it's quite successful looks like a lot of you would like to know how to do it so there is another method is a couple more steps involved but it is quite good I like it so I'm keep watching so hurry up as I said to you I'm going to show you another way of printing on the cotton t-shirts is with the sublimation inks as well as the last minute I show you with that with the powder but this one involved a couple steps mark you're going to decide if you like it out now basically what we do is printing on on a sublimation printer with sublimation ink in my case I was a reco printer just simply print them to design in mirror on the sublimation paper and we're gonna print some polo shirt is 100% cotton as you can see I don't know if you can see it properly yes J hey let's crack on and see how it's done oh by the way before we start I show you what's going on basically what it is you need to put like a special pretreatment on the t-shirt there's lots of pretreatment is like a powder as I show you in one of my videos which hits about 35,000 of your song thanks very much um this one is in basically what it is is just a fits in a 3-4 months you can buy in the hundreds it's like a poly eight polyester sheets you can go wrong because the one side is a glossy is the one you apply on here and the other one as a logo printed on it so there's only one way to apply so it's quite easy so let me show you what steps are involved in it so so here we are this is a transport sublimation transfers smoke enlargement and this is a sublet cotton so what we need to do now we to trim to the size of a transfer so let me just grab that Jesus and let's see what sizes we need so need some kind of half of the ring very right always twist a little bit bigger than the transfer so that what is ready and we can use this crap for the smaller one okay as you can see slightly bit slightly larger are we going to apply this piece of polyester really because that's where it is it's called simply cotton I got it from Spain from company called blender oh I can really remember Philly so Spanish name anyway um please look in the description below the wind fellow the video so I will place the link when you can have it so if you want to test you can I wished folder a few sheets or whole pack it wasn't that expensive so okay so let's apply to the way to the polo shirt though so the press heat up to the correct temperature is 2000 total solid 210 centigrade for the 20 seconds and we need to apply there we need to apply the sob cotton is quite hot for the cotton so what you probably will do you probably will go yellow puff we have to say okay so here is the big transfer this is the big transfer so we put in transfer on the side and applying just the silicon so we'll place somewhere here so 210 centigrade for 20 seconds quite lots of steam moving this temperature I will wait just a couple seconds no more than freefall and try to remove there so become okay you're probably wondering how will you find the place when you put the sublet item you probably won't say it but you try to zoom in now you probably want to say but there there is a quite rough area now when all the fibers goes up so that's how I see when to when to apply there when to apply the transfer okay now we do the front I don't have a jig or nothing for the front so I just put it on the side to do the quick quickly so I do it this way here we go just make it flap and now we put the smaller table cut huh and again 20 seconds again quite a lot of steam and times up few more seconds let us do goes away and we peel in it straight away so now is when the fun should start begin I get to lower the temperature down for from 210 to down to 200 only where I'm going to rise the time from 20 seconds to 35 this is recommended by their by the seller so so I'm gonna do it as they want me to do just wait till the temperature drop and I'm going to bring their chest first okay temperature dropped so now we need to find the spot as I said these more rough area same pretty much same shape as this one is here roughly I hope I'm gonna hit the spot if not it's going to be embarrassing it doesn't really matter okay now I'll put some teflon sheet on it 200 degrees for 35 seconds times nearly up it's 200 centigrade so is really really hard nope oh I don't think I am heat this bot correctly no I keep this pod I don't think I have enough brusha because the color looks bit more beat door not too bad not too wet for the one of the first atoms you know this is the front and let's try the back again okay semester that's the bat let's find that the rough place yeah I can see a straight awake on the big one yes okay so definitely sheets again off we go yeah it's much better much much better but you remember when I mentioned the rough the rough fabric so all you can do you can just put some different sheets over again the clear price you know let's review that result so I'm back on my chair now with the Palo in my hand and as I said it's not as vivid as I wanted here we go this is the result this is the front and this is the back this is the back I looked closely closely into it is very acceptable results by the way is nice but I never done the pollo again with this method just a tight wave cotton cotton t-shirts and I was looking really nice the problem with the companies and sorrow with will the Cottenham Paulo is their wave it was a tiny little house like this I don't know what would you call it but you stop perfectly smooth so that's where the ink didn't go to so that's why either you look big fate it's not actually fine he didn't the ink didn't fill out all those little house so is more testing so more testing needs to be done on those maybe maybe writer writes the time or temperature or something but in the one thing that I don't really like that matter for this method is is the temperature used temperature used for this method was like oh well over 200 degrees so but if you ever printed a cotton above one 170 or maybe 175 180 you will now that if you live in for a little bit too long just go yellow this one is not too bad I'm sure that yellow goes away with first wash by again you don't want to show that to the test of so so in general the method is great is cheap so cheap cheap cotton t-shirts cheap subway Cottenham polyester sheets and you can have a nice nice dish it's done because it is quite a few steps involved I'm not sure if this is for everyone and this is for the mass production but if you want to just one or two loves no problem so as I said we need to do more testing so see you soon", "5KGs87rIux8": "if you're looking for a sublimation printer kit that can create clear vibrant and long-lasting transfers for cotton items sawgrass has got you covered hi everyone it's jared with heat press nation and i'll be taking a look into the sawgrass chroma blast printer kit that's bundled with the sg500 and sg-1000 printers both sg printers will offer the same great results shown in this video [Music] sawgrass chroma blast printer kits are designed to bring the lasting and rich colors of sublimation directly onto light-colored cotton items using specialized inks and media the transfers created with the chromoblast kit are similar to those of inkjet printers with light heat transfer paper which means that they'll rely on the white or bright shades of a cotton item but are as soft as the fabric when applied if you already own a sawgrass printer for your sublimation blanks having another for chroma blast can be a great way to expand your decoration and customization projects with the chroma blast printer kit completely set up to your computer and powered on simply find the image you'd like to print through sawgrass print manager be sure that your printer's ink has been set to chromoblast on the manage printers menu first then you'll be able to print with an optimized profile you can either print an image within a simple shape to trim by hand or prepare one to print and cut with your vinyl cutter by printing and cutting however you'll need to mirror your image in your cutting software rather than leaving the mirror option checked on sawgrass print manager with the image printed trim it to your preference and then it's ready to be applied on a light colored cotton item to apply chromoblast media your machine will need to be set to 30 seconds at 375 degrees fahrenheit with firm pressure once it reaches temperature go ahead and place your cotton item on the lower platen then place and center your transfer facing down towards it cover the transfer with parchment paper and then press when the timer reaches zero open your machine and peel the chromoblast transfer while it's hot your cotton item has now been applied with a beautiful and soft chromoblast transfer to learn more about chromoblast sawgrass and other

hey guys it's Melissa with shirt space and today I'm bringing up the hot talk okay enough of the cheesiness so let's jump right in to pick the best shirt for heat transfer vinyl the shirt has to meet a certain criteria it will not only need to be a great T to wear but it will also need to be a tea that works well with your heat transfers heat transfer vinyl works well with many fabrics but we think these two type of fabrics stand out above the rest the first is a hundred percent polyester polyester is less likely to shrink than any other fabrics but what does this have to do with heat transfer vinyl once your design has been added to the tea it's crucial that it does not shrink this could wrinkle pull or even ruin the vinyl with 100% polyester you know your shrinkage will be minimal and we like minimal shrinkage especially when it comes to HTV but I'm not just gonna stop there what if we could take it to another level well there's no what-ifs about it we can with three simple words cotton poly blend cotton poly blends are the best of both worlds you have the durability and minimal shrinkage from the polyester and the softness and wearability of the cotton the blending of these two fabrics will create an overall makeup that you will love since this is our number one candidate what's the top tea we recommend in this category drumroll please it's the bell of canvas 3001 CVC made up a 52% heirloom combed and ring spun cotton which is the best cotton out there and 48 percent polyester weighing in at 4.2 ounces this is a lightweight tea that you will love to

going to show you how to use a hundred percent cotton t-shirt to make a mask without sewing it of course you're gonna want a long-sleeve shirt you'll take and cut the shirt right about the armpit again this doesn't take any sewing go along the side make sure you keep the seam in your cut area I'm gonna lay this flat so it's a little better to work with and you'll have a theme on one side this is an old t-shirt so it's an Allegro flat I've washed it many times I'm not when I wear anymore you want to cut down about six inches on each side just enough to make it tie and then you're gonna cut up from the wrist up again about six inches maybe a little less the spine it depends on how long your t-shirt is but you want to leave here about I'd say six to eight inches in the middle then the next thing you're gonna do is take your shirt your sleeve and tuck in these extra pieces this is going to give you a four actually a six layer cotton cotton shirt that you can turn into a mask so you'll have six layers of a hundred percent cotton now when I'm sewing masks I put two layers on the outside and a hundred percent cotton batting the inside so this will kind of simulate that inside cotton batting so once you tuck all those in just want to lay them flat make sure they're comfortable then you're going to end up with a mess like this you can tie the sides and then this goes around the ears you can cut these extra pieces off let's make sure you fit it to your face then you have a very simple cotton mask that you can put over that's four or six panels thick of 100% cotton", "O6cI0vGuskk": "hello just gonna do some illustrations of printing that can be done at home or wherever you like using two software programs and examples of two t-shirts the first one is a round neck t-shirt quite simple white simple design as you can see it it's got a it's got a round neck at the front very light very airy and the second one is this one's a sports t-shirt with my own jokey design on it as you can see it's quite simple it's got black lining around the edges and also it's a v-neck and basically what we're going to do is use two software programs to print out and print on these t-shirts the two software programs I enjoy using are this is the first one this is called coral draw it's basically a vector based program very similar to Adobe Illustrator but you get so much sharpness on it using vector and the second one is Photoshop another nice is the industry standard for actually printing and stuff or for designing and those are two preferable programs I use for do my designs alright so what we're gonna do now is we're going to take that design and print it onto the printer let's just set the printing up make sure everything's there we go there's a print preview mirror the image that's fine check the color which is everything's fine let's go for a print or fly it first as in merit as you can see on the panel there it's long mirrors let's go for a print and as you see it's pooling at the moment and any second now it should be sending the information down the printer there it goes any second now with a print should come out you never look at it now comes now this is the heat press you pick them up reasonably cheap on eBay simple - it's basically a flat iron really I think see I've loaded the t-shirt onto that ready I'm gonna put my picture there and we'll do it now in fact right line it up make sure it's upside right there we go fine then what I use is this it's basically safety pallet parchment very cheap you can use a Teflon sheet if you like but I'm quite happy to use it it worked me developed at times about this basic question of switching the actual heat press on and printing a mic and this is the baking parchment that I use you picked that up from anywhere as the Morrisons Tesco it's just bacon is basically non-stick baking paper other people use Teflon sheets which again you can buy off eBay but as far as I'm concerned I've been using that for many many t-shirts and seems to be working fine what we've done is we've pressed the plate down using this handle I've set my temperature for 200 degrees which 100 just about that area and you should count me down now that was set to 60 seconds and any second now we should lift the presser and see the final results of the actual t-shirt and hopefully you'll come up fine alarm sounds swing that away move forward take that off gently and now we have it perfect t-shirt hopefully you see that perfect print every time I list it it's washable what resistor or fade or have you it's stuck on there permanently you", "IGuraSPahVU": "hi I'm Rachel you too sis and I'm gonna show you how to shrink a shirt for whatever reason you want to shrink a shirt the temperature of the water is gonna determine how small your shirt gets I've had a shirt come out of the dryer looking like a Barbie shirt before and I never got to wear it again it also depends on the material of the shirt if it's something that's a really like you know like a sweater material it's gonna shrink a lot faster if you just have cotton it's gonna take a little more to shrink it so boil some water on your stove after it's been boiling you want to bring it over and dump it into a bowl or a pan whichever shirt you want to shrink drop it in that hot water let it sit in there until the water goes cold really let it sit in that hot water after you do that if you wash the shirt on the hottest possible setting in your washing machine it'll shrink it even more and if you dry it for a long time in the dryer on a hot setting you should come out with the shirts it's about two three sizes smaller at least I'm Rachel you choose this and that is how you should make a shirt", "P9_qwDHlpTY": "hi guys welcome back to testing basics thank you so much for watching this is the long-awaited white t-shirt testing basics thank you so much for your patience with me when filming this one I've done 10 t-shirts in this it's taking quite a long time to get through them all and now yeah they're all playing white t-shirt they're all crew net they're all short sleepe they're all in a size small or equivalent of so I can UK eight or European 36 or whatever all a size small the price margin if this is relatively narrow now the reason for that is that most brands t-shirt price comes at a similar point although they're all around the 10 to 20 pound mark and then what's gonna do really expensive on an ordered a really expensive one this one from James purse which I ordered of Selfridges which was an whopping seventy five pounds I don't know if you can see that that and and I'm sending this back I'm not reviewing this one I'll tell you about it now but I'm not reviewing it because it is see-through and frankly feels like the worst of them all sheiva 20 Hannah's 399 and this feels cheap as a touch so I don't want to wear it and wash it and then not be able to return it when I know this is just not worth that much money so I wanted to mention it in this capacity and just say do not go and spend 75 pounds on this t-shirt and then just also show you that I had bought an expensive one but the reasoning behind is not having a really huge price roads I can normally would so the most expensive one is now going to be 35 pounds instead so everything in this video is really affordable and basically yeah I don't recommend Jones purse t-shirts or going to spend 75 pounds on something hoping you can see there's just like thin cheap see-through just not nothing special and I'm sure it'll just be a hundred percent cotton 100% supima cotton nearly all of them are hundred percent cotton that we have here so that's that now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to try them all on now with them on just tell you the sizing the fabric material the brand and the price the first impression segment it's gonna come as I've been wearing them all I want to try and make this video as short as possible so to avoid any repetition I'm not talking about my first impressions now also been wearing them already so it wouldn't be first impressions and and instead we'll go and as I'm wearing as a warn each of them are giving you my face impressions throughout the past two weeks I've been filming this and then as always I'm gonna watch them all together all in an identical wash and then we shall come together at the end and see which one we think is the winner but yeah what 10 t-shirts here so this is gonna be quite fast snappy informative for this section okay but this time I'm gonna show you them all untucked because I've been waiting topped in throughout the week so that you seem different and I'm not gonna wear a bra throughout this video because I never wore a bra anyway and that's how I would wear them going forward in real life but also and it's going to be a complete level playing field and how they look and how they feel can we just not make any comments about the fact I'm not wearing a bra this is an informative video and the fact that sometimes you can see my nipples for video does no way negate change or influence and information anyway so I just wanted to acknowledge it in terms of how we're making this and even review and leave it that so first up it H&M this is their 399 t-shirts this is a size small this is 95% cotton and 5% a last day from the divided range and this one was requested quite a lot for me to review because it's 399 and H never sort known for having a lot of t-shirts at that price point and so yes H net three pound 99 in a size small 95% cotton 5% last day moving up one is a sauce this was six pounds it's 100% cotton and I have this in a UK sized eight excuse it's very very very boxy posing I literally feel like I look like an emoji or sim waiting to be dressed or picked or something and but yeah a sauce size eight six pounds 100% cotton is our next one do a quick spin spin spin and next we're one up again one week day now at eight pounds also hundred percent cotton in a size small where possible if the t-shirt obviously the specific ones will be linked in the description box some of them have specific names to them this one has a name I can't remember it right now but why most of all I will link the names mention the names in the description box or on the screen now as well so that you if you're going in store you know which ones to ask for is opposed to shopping online so yet weekday eight pounds size small and next up on to you look close from the Uniqlo you range it was nine pound 90 and it is a size small and it's also a hundred percent cotton Uniqlo you if definitely available on store I can lie in store and online so yeah Uniqlo nine pound 90 hundred percent cotton size small okay but the halfway point here this is Topshop this was 10 pounds is in a size small and is so no this is they call this a size extra small small so they do them this t-shirt of bracket so then it was medium to large I think the small medium X this is extra small to small and is a hundred percent cotton Topshop 10 pounds well they're all going to be covered in makeup now after this as well this one is very oversized as we can see I'm a bit closer as well yeah top this top shop that's number five next is this selected firm this was highly requested as a brand this was 15 pounds size small also 100% costume it's a brand that I think is completely new to me I don't think I've had anything from them before but this specific t-shirt came up a lot that selected fab I just don't know why I'm doing this impose I'm really sorry I'm trying to make it as box it was unflattering as possible for them also you can like really see the shape before you see them styled up throughout the rest of it but I'm sort of walking like a robot to do it and selected Pham 15 pounds 100% cotton size small okay coming in at the exact same price point we have cause here this is also in a size small also 15 pounds also 100% cotton and let's just go quickly go back to the symposium they are and how difficult this is going to be to differentiate from them all so that was course 15 pounds so small and they way they're sizing never says small what they're sizing easily correctly on the screen now this might actually say size 36 as opposed to a small so listen to Watson written on the screen here but the cause 100% cotton 15 pounds okay we've got Evelyn here now this isn't dollar so it was 16 dollars so put it in the price in this price bracket for what I paid for it but it would convert to a bit less in pounds but then the shipping is more because it's coming from America so I'm kind of confident that it needs to be in position number 8 price-wise even though a little for currency but yeah this is Evelyn this is also size small and 100% cotton and everything is obviously a sustainable and ethical brand the others are not so yeah every Lane 16 dollars and we'll write the conversion on the screen now but do bear in mind shipping if you uk-based if you're America based I'm not sure well there should be like sixteen dollars size small 100% cotton right second from the top price wise minute and other stories this is 23 pounds I have a size 36 which is the size I always go for and then and it's also 100% cotton surprise surprise it's only been there and H&M one which isn't on there was that cost her I think from me trying order through the face of it you can see the difference the elastic makes it is kind of a t-shirt that's meant to be a bit different I would say because of that anyway yeah this was under the story's 23 pounds size thirty-six hundred percent cotton last one now and our final most expensive one is our kept this was 35 pounds and I have this I forgot chef size on the label it's the size small equivalent again it will be written oh yeah it is a size small European small and it is put their labels were complicated very aesthetically pleasing but not helping you right now this is all 96% cotton 4% elastane this is 35 pounds now arquette do do a cheaper t-shirt haven't always gone for what the cheapest t-shirt is available and they do a more basic one and which I can't under the price of it but just to make that clear I really want us to test this one out and I'd be interested to know you can tell at this point already which ones you guys think look and feel similar I can tell but I don't know if that's because it's on my skin but this is very similar to one of the ones we've tried on earlier in terms of how it feels and so yeah this was our kept 35 pounds 96% cotton 4% the last day so similar composition to the cheapest one interesting mm-hmm and and yes that's all of them were now just going to go straight to the next segment of me wearing them throughout the past couple of weeks before we do fine all use day and night and for the evening I've had on my system denim jeans churches robes the Uniqlo white t-shirt and our cat silk shirt and historic blazer now let me delay us so we can discuss the t-shirt so as I said at the beginning of this had got them all on the sides more for ease of comparison which doesn't necessarily mean it's the perfect size that makes sense so I come a recommendation for this you've got big boobs size up just because it's really tight not comfortably - I have not been noticing it when it is tight and tight and I like aesthetically I'd say through the season under the armpits that's because it pulls at my boobs so if you've what changes true to size bigger boobs hundred-percent size up now I like these enough to say that I would go and purchase it again in it's good enough to work spending the money twice I think that it's really nice thick cotton and look good roots neckline of it and it's a thick cotton without being stiff in the center it's got a texture to it this is just the best way that I can describe it in nipples wouldn't rub on this t-shirt that's like something that Linda's message me about t-shirts of the day and it's such a good way to think of a certain t-shirt and sometimes with the really stiff cotton ones are aesthetically white a lot that can sometimes be a bit uncomfortable if you're not bra wear like I am and also as I said I'm not gonna work brass throughout this video just again that would comparison purposes we can and so yeah I think it's got a great structure to it it's really nice and soft while being really thick and love the collar on it and wish the sleeves were a bit bigger and just a bit longer but I think going size up would do that purpose for me and if you were flat chested you would feel like I just have more space here than I do anyway so that's my advice on this move a little bit t-shirt it's all coming down thickness in the fabric the field that makes this one so good so definitely recommend and would purchase in the medium hey hey hey guys I am just going to raise you up a bit higher I've had on today the selected famine 1000 that I picked one last night actually I'm sort of was just many areas to expound Church Road sweet deck jeans and this ocean under the story's leather bar and then the selected fan t-shirt now to compare this closer to the unit level because that's um you know size-wise the smaller this fits me better than the Uniqlo it definitely has more space into the armpit you think you've got big boobs you could silver for small increases more because the cotton is definitely thinner in the end and then they do declare one I haven't been on any of the it definitely has more creasing in it and it is it feels slightly soft and I think that's just again because it's a slightly thinner cotton but the text from it's almost identical just thinner and then the Apple is rose well my guess it doesn't have that starchiness to it or anything like that but still manages to be thick and the color on this is also really nice but the the Uniqlo I keep saying the wrong word the Uniqlo one that we compared it to is a slightly thicker on the neckline and this is I don't know if that's gonna make much sense but they've both got a nice ribbed neckline but the Unicoi one was just a bit chunkier and felt like more of a feature with it and all of this is a really great t-shirt overall I would say it's come here and it fits slightly more oversized and Uniqlo definitely longer through the body as well so probably a better sizing me because of having big boobs if I have to say which one I prefer think Uniqlo one just do the thickness of the cotton feels a bit nicer but that was down to my personal preference of why I like a t-shirt this I think is a really good fit to it and it's really soft and everything to been around spinning around and kind of Topshop on stage Fashion Week white it's weekday and cardigan from the mayor and the Topshop t-shirt this one is a lot bigger than the rest just speaker means better in some cases potentially but maybe not in a white t-shirt and it is very very boxy which already like it's been very comfortable and feel wise this it is and like a similar thickness to the Uniqlo one I'd say but it's not got the same smoothness to it has a slightly one off the texture but I think because the oversize nity is still very very very comfy and I almost feel like I have important that such similar as either to that war because the bagginess makes me heart it makes it hard for me to compress it in the same way and because it's meant to go up size basically but I really like it in great chopped into jeans because of the shape and as I said really move comfortable and the neckline it's nice and stuff again the Uniqlo one sort of has better detailing on it for things like this but I think this is a really really really good white t-shirt and I think one you know just to wear like this in spring/summer with white jeans on normal denim jeans the bagginess of it and the site details of what the pinned sleeves while this mainly gives it an unfair advantage because it's not identical to the others it's something which i think is a nice little added extra styling wise is the Massimo Dutti I'm Jackee a jumper from jigsaw and stories like trousers Gucci loafers belt big out I've no next time fooling with comparing everything in this video that's so how do we see the light and it's like the price is also similar it's it's so fast to know what detail so this one feels the most delicious let them walk so far today do you know more that's pumping out the stick it's really different to the rest top shop on HSN today and Uniqlo molitor's and its thickness and the feel of it and this is a really lush crouch down familiar a much lighter weight fabric than the Uniqlo wore like I said it's probably actually this one probably feels a finish so far from honest and we're off again sorry about that so yes and this will probably feel that it's finished out of all the ones I've tried so far and probably the least expensive basically it feels like because this do excuse how tight I look right now but yeah it's a great t-shirt but I wouldn't say and you know everything obviously always gets burning point of a budget sustainable but this especially compares the quality of smoothies I've got anything out there in spectacular whatsoever and yeah not no one fastness when I would say it would definitely directly recommend the \u00fanico one more for sure and this one still feels differently actually a long as the H no one is so much tight and have more stretch in it but it just just doesn't feel particularly arduous in any way I would say which is the most expensive one and I just have been out all day with various outfits like this morning back in the Gucci loafers you know me when I something I like I really just stick with it for a while hence these being on so constantly weekday sea otter jeans it my sleeveless ravely you how much make cardigan now this is the most similar now this is the most similar to the unit plan warning terms how it feels the texture is almost identical and say it feels the task think I just feel bit once that's it I don't know if it warrants the reminding is it 20-pound high stiffness that we've got which is a huge sum of money but within this video says you know our price range is so tight and so yeah texture wise it's definitely the most similar to the Uniqlo one it's got a really similar neckline to it and the sleeves are much better than much longer sleeve it's not got the same tightness over the boobs and everything like the Uniqlo one did and so the fate of it is better and yes I would gladly spend thirty five pounds this t-shirt basically I think if you are flat-chested or if I got a medium in the Uniqlo one I'll go for that one over it but that's not said I don't think this one feels like it's worth the money and but it is incredibly more special but I think it is just as smooth simple tasty softball structure without being rough and which is a really nice texture basically and the long sleeves on this thinkin's summer means I'm going to wear it more like I said I can go what a medium or a large going at the man's walk the purpose of this video comparing it to the ones I've got either sack small I think of an intended whale is going forward however because they're so similar you know gets the recommendation of war because it's different enough to warrant what is making this the most expensive one in this video but it doesn't mean that with this for I've passed it that's such a conflict in review I really hope that makes some sense basically I think it's a great t-shirt yes I think it's worth those five pallets of a get up against a tough competition and I think you could save twenty pounds still have a similar styling and t-shirt experience but yeah obviously recommend the Gucci loafers as well these are coming out the most recommended thing in this bloody video [Music] t-shirt wearing it with you can plan cosmetic cardigans sneaky layer taupe traveling and jacket Jesus or trousers and there's broke a belt on frankly just got very much [Music] disheartened saying it but every day I'm like no say about them this one feels different to the are cat and handled stories sorry that are can you declare one it's thinner than the Topshop one it's nicer than H number one one actually it has a nice smooth texture to it to me quite smooth texture to it it's a very classic fit I mean the small fits really well we're going to each size and I actually think this is a very nice like basic fitting t-shirt I want to say neckline nice and thick but not as like chunky feeling is the Uniqlo in arquette but it's kind of in keeping with the thickness of the rest of the t-shirt it's very soft it's not to see through more seasons the others and yeah I really like it I really like it and I recommend this want to help this is so difficult so I think every person rationalize and try one of these on so I'm hoping that once I get basically what I'm going to do is edit this section video before I film I can fill my final thoughts to refresh my memory of them all and then hopefully this final section this is giving a bit more concise but these are also similar so this way I'm just going to recommend to not eh no one but the water from that in terms of whichever surface that's like who I've seen is going because they're all so similar so what's the points that he found more up any more than you need to apart from a computer or iPad hey guys excuse me but to look like very well today I'm just having one of those rough days and I hope on the Animus tour today just with an anniversary is currently at my to ten genes handsome man slip ons earlier just barefoot round house and now I very much like t-shirt like all the others producing refresh my memory the prices come all of this is the second most expensive one and I think it's actually far too similar to the cause one the weekday one they're all part of the same group is all these are partly H&M group and for it to warrant the price difference between there and do you think comparing this to that are kept on the I can't one does feel a lot more expensive so that I price of that just feel more justified then this one compared to all of good ones and I do immensely playing things have got a nice oversized fit to it even though this is a size eight and it's a really soft and lovely t-shirt but it just feel quite similar to like I said because one and maybe less so we don't feel a little bit more structured but like the selected famine 1 which in number 15 powers and so ya know basically this one I don't really see why this is 23 pounds compared to those are the ones so you know under the story's not getting the most shining review which is absolutely you know so not especially from the stories you guys got like the biggest photo that rant and but yeah II just don't see why this one needs to be twelve pounds more no that was wrong maths fifteen eight pounds more and we're talking you know we've small amounts of money here but I need to be this picky with it oft white eight pounds model Soviet ones but still a booty show this morning in read jeans Gucci loafers and to the stories jumper at H&M t-shirt this one is very different to the race it is a much stretches skinnier material now aesthetically that makes me like a less like I've said it several times throughout this video by that and do you prefer a looser fitting kind of style of t-shirt and that's not to said there is no place for this sort is showing in the wardrobe it's a really good layering piece if you've got boobs it is gonna stretch over your boobs like a bit as you can see I'm not gonna brown on us always but this would be hard t-shirt to wear a bra anyway you're either going to see you nipples if you don't you good to see ya I don't promise you have a really good t-shirt bra and so yeah this is much probably my least favorite this is also the cheapest well this was three ninety-nine and because of the tightness of it makes me feel like that looks the cheapest but I do also think hmmm how I think this admission is when they do in this one was specifically requested me to review and but maybe it might have like a size large in this it would make me not feel like it looks as cheap it is literally just the tightness in my and perception of a t-shirt when it which isn't necessarily what you guys would think as well and yeah like I said I think it's a good piece to have any water for a layering piece I think that I wish the neckline was a bit tighter and closer because then I would get a lot more worried about it as a layering top so to put under like crewneck jumpers and things the next bit - Scooby to show up over a jumper and so yeah while it would be the load is against again I have my list here 399 or a source we not worn that one yet but six pounds of the 204 it's of interesting to see whether the tick the box for me and the fabric is really nice it's just got a lot more stretch in it than either one and but you can feel that way if it wasn't so try as well hey guys on the weekday t-shirt today sorry the blazer is from I kinda just got no cashmere hoodie I saw a jeans weekday through some churches my belts a vintage Chanel one and then we did t-shirt which one studies in the will with this because it's so similar to the cause one similar to the end of the stories walk back think I prefer the neckline of this one so similar to the Cosmo not going to recommend this one over it because it's cheaper a sauce nice that it's nice and eh no more knots think it's the uniform of the arc at one very similar to the selectmen ones so again I recommend this more because it's cheaper and so yeah I think this one the Utica and I've had kind of catch mm some ways she probably tell you throughout this video in terms of all the others which she was raised in my life so far I'd say this one's a winner fits really well this leaves our nice length and that clients lovely and it's cheaper than all the others it's the tubing at 15 pounds nice there the other way one yeah it's really hard to do today but this one really like it feels like the right thing it's bit cheaper and and it does have the nice ribs neckline that we keep talking about how oh god I fell over that we mean it's just wait did you see that jiggle yeah the yellow it's just a nice thick and everything tick-tock boxes basically so we get we don't come into it I'm very much into these jeans at the Seattle ones by the way okay guys rusty shirt with a salon which does have toothpaste our neck so that's nice but yes similarly to and we have attained for BuzzFeed a this is a nice teacher it feels like we don't know the stories wanna feel that depend on that whole get to feel all incredibly similar so I'm just gonna stop repeating myself now put them in the wash in sauce that's hope to god but warnings drastically so I have some clearer I do into this video as to what I want to say and not I'm not to go anything about it because this is such as there are certain is so difficult to differentiate or more and when yeah this in the end engineers and judge roads and and that is the last t-shirt I never see a white t-shirt again over too soon okay guys we are now at the end I have washed every single t-shirt unfortunately none of them fell apart in the washer so unfortunately because it would have given me a really clear distinction between some of them which is what I'm struggling with at the moment there's been the hardest testing basis ever done for this reason it has been such a level playing field the price range has been quite narrow the fact is a white t-shirt there's not much disparity between them all anyway it has been so so so hard and even going through them now I am struggling and I just rewashed the whole thing what I've edited up to this point trying to look at like how they fit how and they're so similar like some are slightly more oversized the top shot one's got a bit more going on with it but then kind of gives it an unfair advantage some of the sleeves look a bit nicer but that's such a personal preference and deciding that it's so difficult and they all basically styling wise will do the same thing and the H&M one is the only one that is a little bit different and like I said during the video I feel like it's meant to be a bit different I am gonna review it in line with all the others if that makes sense um so yeah I've done my best to order them but my general thing is that if there's a brand that you've seen in this you feel like you have a particular brand loyalty to whatever reason like either you find that a little stories always pitching you your body type great or I am ever laying always fits your body type great or you come to the shopping sustained delay or something then going with whatever one your brand loyalty lies with because they're all great there's been nothing wrong with any of them really and they were washed fine they would all I think last while and yeah there's none that I'm like apart from the generous person which we've talked about at the beginning and so yeah I have put them in order but that is my general view if there's a brand loyalty and and then I'm gonna go straight against that cuz I've actually thought the end of the store is one in last place and you guys know how much I absolutely adore under the stories of the brand it's my favorite high street brand comes down this jumpers and all the stories actually and and they were all of the time and just absolutely adore it and and there's nothing wrong with this t-shirt whatsoever the fit of it is great it's really nice and soft and texture-wise I'm like feeling them all at once now there's not there's not one that stands out it's incredibly soft I mean normally if it wouldn't be because it's not my kind of a t-shirt it would make it kind of a lot looser and have a bit less structure to it and I think previously I've done t-shirts where I can barely use American Vintage warm oh it's almost like a sloped t-shirt which isn't my edit like that they do all feel really similar and they're all soft and comfortable how does this one the fit is great I like the kind of bigger sleeves it's boxy and everything it's a really great t-shirt it was just up against ones which are also really great that were eight pounds I'm not 23 pounds now and of the stories is marketed obviously as a higher price brand they're like weekday even though they're part of the same group and H&M and things and but yeah for this one I sort of thought I don't know why you'd want just feel like you have to go and spend and eight pounds more than other than on some of the others so I think for the first time ever under the stores is coming in last place and but yeah I still love you one of the stories and I just don't think you need to go spend 23 pounds on the t-shirt seconds last place is going to be HTM 1 and these are 399 t-shirts and I also want to make it clear I'm not getting rid of any of these t-shirts believe me I'm aware of the XS and the fact I've got so many but in the summer a high a white t-shirt is higher rotation for me and I will wear them all equally so that even though I've just put that under the surf on in last place you will see me wear it again it will be tacked on my Instagram and YouTube videos I'm gonna wear them all again which is why I do recommend them all if this makes sense and including this H&M one which I'm going to use more as a layering piece between now and when it gets a little bit warmer because it's got that elastane in it and it makes it a lot tighter and if you like a tight look or like maybe slightly more flat chested so it looks a little bit less stretched over your boobs then stick for a small but I would think I should go for a size up personally but the skinniness of it it just makes it a really good layering piece but because of how it looks it's not piece I necessarily wanna wear on its own which is how I feel about all of the other ones because they just have a nice they're on my body type and and yeah it's got this stretch in it which the others just don't have in the same way so yeah hmm in that in that place for that reason but for $3.99 I think it's a really really really brilliant t-shirt and and you just buy those some of that wear them to bed because even though it's quite tight it's still soft and comfy and so you could wear them around the house and for $3.99 that's I think that's like just such a good piece to go bulk-buy who needed to and get them in different colors but aesthetically it was not my favorite one like I said I was wearing it and in next place I just realised that no this was gifted to me I didn't tell you the ones which were gifted at the beginning I'll write it in description box was really clear this was gifted those - I thought the arquette one was gifted and unfortunately it's coming in seventh place and again similar to the end of the stories one it was 35 pounds I just think there's other ones that were really great which were a lot less than that and equally it does feel more expensive than the rest it feels thicker the texture of it I'm just gonna hold it up and really close to you with this is and all the stories one this is the arquette one and I think you can see the smooth texture of the are kept on quite nicely so that just that just feel like a step up in quality with it and so it's kind of like I don't I understand why it costs more but ultimately from doing this video I don't think you need to go and spend more on a white t-shirt to get what you need out of a white t-shirt basically and so and it's also very similar to the Uniqlo one and how the texture is and how it feels which we're gonna come to that more later and if there hadn't been the Uniqlo in this this would have definitely gotten bumped a lot higher because like I said it just feel a lot more expensive but I don't know that I would repurchase 35-pound t-shirt from marquette or I didn't buy as myself but I don't know if I would now knowing how many different ones there are in their place gonna be the other Lane one which I'm kind of upset about because I'm in love ever Lane as a brand I've got quite a few things from them and I do really really like them and a great brand or less sustainable all that good stuff and this one just kind of looked especially when I was watching it back the fit of it was not as snacks I've been so picky because it was just basic because it sure through the body so when I was watching ours that kind of kind of look as nice as some of the other ones but when I was wearing it on the day it still felt like it looked completely fine and but it does have a slaw I need to scratch your texture to the rest ever ever ever so slightly and so yeah ever lanes gonna come in that place I hope you guys can see how difficult this is because the reasons that I'm having to rank everything or like miniscule reasons and in that sixth place in fifth place have put a sauce it's just six pounds over that two pounds more than the HTM one and and it has a different look to it to the hmm 1/2 pounds less than the weekday one and the similarities between these it's just ridiculous if the weekday one's a tiny bit softer that we do when I've just got here yet but tiny bit softer it's a different texture to the H number one because of the last name I could discuss and things like the neckline on this one aren't quite as nice as on some of the others and I was talking about that quite a lot at the beginning of me wearing them and and then that the discussion of detail sort of waned as I was waning throughout this video and but yeah the neckline on it's kind of not as nice and chunky as some of the others with the crew necks and this leaves a little bit more like a cap sleeve and a nice big sleeve like I was talking about on the end of the stories one which f place lower down than this and now I'm like this doesn't make any sense um well yeah I'm just gonna stick with this a sawsan in fifth place for no particular reason it seems I put Topshop in fourth place I do kind of feel that this one wasn't really fair to compare but I've got this in store bought this in store and and when I went in the shop this was live like in their basic salary this was the basic white t-shirt but then it doesn't feel as basic as all of the other brands basic white t-shirt and I think I'm gonna wear this a lot in the summer I'm learning like the boxing nurse and really like how emphasized it is really nice thick cotton to it as well like they all are and but feels a slight a slightly more like structured starchy cotton I suppose and I just haven't kind of have a different look for it for that and all that maybe you should lose some points with the fact it's got bracketed sizing like extra small to small that's not great is it I prefer to have it like a specific size so maybe actually I should have pushed this down a few pegs for that because the rest of them have been like quite good size and wise and nowadays is there any need for bracketed sizing it's like brandy melville the fact they do one size Emily driving me mental and so in third and fourth no fourth and third place I've put cause and selected FEM they are just a nearly bloody identical I thought that I'd put selected firm up one because it made a statement beginning the video that was incorrect that said that ever Lane was the only sustainable Brandon this obviously Arquette is making big steps for sustainability and they're quite open with their supply chain and and I got an email yesterday about selected them and now I can't what the percentage was it something like fifty percent sustainable on their range that they have and they're pushing that more and more so they're also brand that's going in the right direction with it so the statement that I made beginning say overlay was the only round who was sustainable that's incorrect and but even they're identical because this selected firms a sustainable brand you're going in the direction off I thought that give that a higher ranking than the cause one and but they are both incredibly similar and actually I think if you handed me them and I close my eyes I wouldn't be able to tell any difference and try to look for detailing that they're finishing on the course at the stitches maybe look a bit nicer but the sleeves the same and the cost sleeves are a tiny bit longer can you see that they're teeny tiny bit longer but like spit the fit wise is pretty much the same so yeah and I would say I'm gonna put if I'm above it for the reasons I just stated but they're both really good t-shirts I think fifteen pounds they boast really good for fifteen pounds I would recommend them both and so that was called and selected fair and and yeah I the selected friend was sent to me as well that was the only other one that was sent to me everything else I bought and I think it's online it and they've got shop so if you liked the look of these one but you need to go in and try it on and go for the class one instead because I'm not sure if they have any physical shops noise in the second place that leaves you with the Uniqlo one this was a put your frontrunner threw you out but I've not given it the first place because I figure out the sidings a bit off and the sizing on the rest is really consistent I think he decides up when this is you've got big boobs especially in the fact that it made it kind of tight under my armpits wasn't ideal I should have bought this lower for that because this is the only one that's been in anyway it wasn't uncomfortable but it didn't have that nice oversized sleeve look to it so I'm up size up but I think the main thing is that the fact is I have 10 t-shirts here white identical t-shirt and yet I look this one enough that I would go and get it in a medium so that I had the perfect fit I'm gonna hold this one up to the next to the arquette one and then hopefully you can kind of just see how incredibly similar the textures are almost identical and like the neckline on this the chunkiness it's just a thick really really really great white t-shirt and like I said I would 100% go get it in a medium said it's the perfect fit for me despite having enough white t-shirts to set up a white t-shirt shop and it leaves me in first place with weekday and don't really have a strong reason for putting it here it was 8 pounds I thought gosh that's sober that's under 10 pounds at surgical price and it does feel a bit softer and a bit nicer than the Asus one which was closest to in price it's more classic than the Topshop one which a sauce and the Topshop have two pounds in the side of this and yet felt more nice than the Topshop one is more consistent and sizing than the Topshop one like we just suggested the fit of it is gray it's still got a really like nice neckline to it that's a bit thicker and a bit more and ripped and just feels nicer than the I saw Swan so it does feel nicer than the a sauce 1/2 and it very very very very similar to the Cosmodrome one but yet is a little bit more expensive a little bit cheaper and also very similar to the under the stories one this cos selected foam and other stories one's the ever lame one has a slightly different feel to it those for a sauce as well that's so incredibly similar so this is what I mean like go with where your brand loyalty lies I've opted room for a weekday first place and somewhat helpful I have this awful feeling it hasn't a bit and they basically it seems like runs at just smashing the white t-shirt sector and so they should how can you get it wrong it's just an essential piece in any wardrobe so I I won't part way so sorry the camera doctor just died so I cut Morales was I just had a cup to you on that recharge and i recharged but I just wanted to end this on reiterating at that and you will see all of these t-shirts on me again I now obviously have a lot of white t-shirts I'm confident I can keep running more throughout the summer and but there's none that I'm like oh I really don't recommend it's been really hard to stack of it and I hope this is helpful in some way if there's one that you felt looked nicer in anyway then you guys go for that one linked for everything in the description box as I said that Arquette and selected pheromones are sent to me everything else I bought and that's kind of covering everything I don't think I'm going to be notion to do the testing basics with 10 items anytime soon more than anything around time you get to the 10th I'm like I can't remember what I said about the first one no it's just so long anyway and I really really hope you enjoyed it thank you so so much for watching I'll see the next one", "KYJfLETGIj8": "Hey its Tory with BELLA+CANVAS there's a\ntime and place for a nice new t-shirt but we also know it's sometimes hard to\nbeat the feeling of a good old worn in team but what if you could create that\nlook right away without spending all those years wearing it in well today\nwe're a deluxe screen printing to map out the basic steps you need for\ncreating vintage tees so there are a few different types of\nt-shirts and fabrics that work well when going for a vintage vibe poly cotton\nblends and tri blends in particular are great because the yarns take the ink\ndifferently giving it that worn in look today we're going to use our vintage\nslub a fabric with a great tonal texture thanks to the uneven knit to showcase\nthis another great option is to go for a shirt that is pre distressed like our\n3009 from the fast fashion collection this tee is made up of super soft 100%\nairlume combed and ring-spun fabric but features holes throughout for that worn\nin look so the next step is to pair that tee with the right design we've\nconsulted an expert designer Charley Pangus Pangus to showcase how to do just that\nwhat's up guys so for this artwork we wanted to apply a nice vintage look and\nin order to achieve that I needed to find some really heavy textures online\nfor the first texture we use rust and when you apply that above the artwork on\ntop we use the white ink so It blended it right into the artwork it gives it a\nnice broken feel which we love with the vintage look for the second texture\nI like to use an oil splatter and I put that below the artwork which gives it a\neven more broken up look it's also important to note that I applied these\ntextures very very heavy on purpose so when we actually print it and you don't\nlose a lot of detail and then when you actually print it you get this nice\nvintage design that we were looking for and last but not least you're going to\nneed to choose a printing technique that complements both the shirt and the\ndesign so there are two different types of inks that you can use for a vintage\nprint there's either plastisol without a base or water base with plastisol\nwithout a base you typically would like to print on a dark fabric that way your\nbright colors are going to get less bright and they're gonna darken up and\nit's gonna lay right on top of that fabric and you're gonna have a little\nbit of a natural distressed look the other way would be to use water base\nwhich is gonna lay into the fabric and it's gonna have a really soft feel to it\nas if you wash that tee a million times there are two different types of\nwater-based inks there's water base that you're gonna print on white or pastel\ncolors when you're printing on darker colors like blacks reds blues you want\nto go to what's called discharge printing that has a discharge base to it\nwhich actually bleaches out the dye in the fabric with that one it's great for\na distressed looked as well depending on the fabric you're using if you're using\na poly blend it's going to discharge the cotton part of it so that's gonna help\nwith that a little bit of that vintage look\nthank you for going bright it's gonna darken up so be aware with that you\nmight want to do some pre-testing on that because your colors will change now\non 100% cotton that color should be true again you'll want to do some testing on\nthat the two tees that we printed today the distressed tee and the slub tee\nare great options when printing that vintage look let us know what you\nthought of the vintage teens we created in this video in the comment section be\nsure to check out how Charlie completed his design in his video linked below you\ncan also check out the products we featured below as well don't forget to\nsubscribe to our channel for more content like this we'll see you next\ntime Be Different.", "fFfBTWFJx_U": "I also guys today I'm going to show you guys out a pretreat and press dark t-shirt I'm using a next-level 100% cotton t-shirt also move the same for 100% Gildan 100% cotton Gildan t-shirt so let's get right to it I'm using the saw hot sonic 16 by 16 heat press and the first thing you're going to do to prick your shirt for our pretreat you're going to press it for 10 seconds I have it get currently still at 340 degrees which is okay you don't need that high to pre-first it but that's what I'm going to need afterwards some to dry out the pretreatment so it says 3:40 I'm going to first it at medium pressure which is number 4 on the hotronix keepers and I'm going to press it for 10 to 15 seconds you also need a craft paper um you can use parchment paper if you don't have access to this or Teflon sheet I normally go with the craft paper because down the parchment paper is really soft and it'll rip apart really easily it doesn't last long the Teflon sheet it's good if you want your graphics to have a sign layer so it leaves like a block you look on it with beyond Teflon sheet whenever you use a craft paper you get more of a flat looking design so position your craft paper and I'm going to press it for 10 seconds I would set at 40 but I'll just count down the 10 seconds 10 to 15 and what is this does is it gets the moisture out of the t-shirt [Music] 10 to 50 okay so you see the paper slide right off now we're going to move over to our pretreat setup okay so I have this little jig that I that I made check the camera it's good made off particle would I would recommend particle with reason being if you use plywood if there's any overspray or anything anywhere it'll just run off this is so soaked it up with the particle is that wood so I found out that therefore it's pretty good pretty good for you now used in beyond particle wood though the main change is same as your t-shirt platen on the vtg it's eleven point seven by 16 and a half you just bring that over it I want to recommend you guys do it inside your home try to do it outside because the chemicals in the pretreat okay you got it all position now let me show you what I'll let you leave I used Firebird pretreat for both light and dark garments I found that this works pretty good never had any issues with it and I've done thousands of shirts usually not you're going to need a roller from loads or own people it's a foam roller all right show you what what I use this for afterwards most importantly you're going to need a Wagner sprayer and one of the most important things about this is to have the settings correct if you have a screwed all the way in what's going to happen is you're going to have too much pretreat it's going to start flooding and it's going to start dripping and running all you need to get all you need is a mix I don't know if you guys can see on where I have it set but I have that the edge of this gray part you see the camera is set in line with that yellow with the end of the yellow part so all you do is I have that set right there and then try to get it as light a lighter of a mist as possible so I'm just going to do a lot to encourage as you can see it's just a light mix you're not really keying like the white from the pretreat if you're seeing up and your is too much so now we're going to do one time across that way and then that way so we're going to go that way that way and then up and then pop down and you need to be at least 12 inches away from the teacher so and then you don't have to go too fast or too slow but if you do go to school you're going to start flooding on your t-shirt it's going to over exaggerate it so here we go that's the first layer and this is where your foam roller comes in you just lightly roll it and this is just a purse but pretreat into the material so that's all you need is just a little minute okay so that's that if you can see it you can probably see the outline of a pretreat then now we're going to go like avoid writing fur-lined it up grab your parchment paper put it on there now I'm going to press it at 300 F 40 degrees for 40 seconds medium pressure and that's number 4 on the hotronix okay right now okay step 4 okay and once this is done your paper your craft paper should just slide right off off your your shirt if it sticks to it like you're feeling as if it's pulling up the fibers off the t-shirt so we've pressed it again for like 10 to 15 seconds see how this goes all right you see the slide right off depending on the heat press that you're using sometimes it may not slide right off you might stick to it a little bit and just press it back 10 to 15 seconds get rid of the excess moisture and that's it slide right off now you have a shirt ready ready to the print with your etg machine so that's it for dark t-shirt also need to add on another little arm device here I want to show you guys it's good to get one of these it's a laser grip it's a heat gun it picks up the heat as a laser light and as a heat sensor this is good because if you are using a different press well no matter what pressure you again you want to make sure that your heat temperature that's on your meter is accurate with the actual heat pad if you notice when I shine the laser on the arm on the heat pad you'll see how much degrees it is so let me get it right here and now it's saying 320 tools so it's fluctuated if I hold it steady I'll get the exact heat that's on the UM just on the UM on the meter so let me get it here and then different heat person sometimes it depends because a lot of the cheaper ones the core isn't it doesn't have beyond the heat the core isn't isn't fully um doesn't have to hold the same temperature so you'll find out that a lot of times you do a press sometimes half of your graphic might not come out properly because there's cold spots on your heating pad so with this thing it's accurate so it's good to use it and check different sections of your heat pad to make sure that I'm you have the correct temperature and that your heat person is showing the right temperature so if I put a link in the description for that go down that's it the dark t-shirt and all you need me to do", "f2E25CDxoRA": "[Applause] cool guys welcome back to another video I'm Daniel and I hope that you fellas are having a good day dressing well and of course getting stuff done alright guys so it's gonna be a nice and quick one today I'm gonna be going through my top ten favorite go-to t-shirts that I personally find myself wearing all the time a lot of you guys always comment in each video what t-shirt I'm wearing so I'm going to be going through all of these showing you guys which are my favorite where I got them from in the price that I paid for them alright guys we are standing straight into it this is a very nice fitted white t-shirt from cause and I paid 25 pounds for this there's two kind of unique features through this t-shirt one is the high neckline which is the main reason I really mess with that I do just love a nice tight high neckline the second is that it's a very light almost see-through material I don't know if you look close enough but you can probably see my mic so it's a very nice breathable one perfect for coming into spring and summer alright guys so staying on the white trend this is my most expensive teacher that I do have this is the acne studio one again similar to the COS high neckline has that printed acne studio a very nice fitting t-shirt absolutely love this this is a lot more of a heavyweight material but it is also quite stretchy so the size every time I wash it it always just comes back to its natural size and I absolutely love it coming on to the third one guys and this is kind of like my most oversized t-shirt that I do have it is very oversized but this is definitely a lot more of a summer vibe t-shirt now the material of this one the reason I like it so much is it is that towel material I got this from All Saints it was on sale when I got it absolutely love it and yet for me this is my kind of more out there t-shirt because I do really like my t-shirts to be simple and played down but with the stripes going across and their texture to this t-shirt it just adds that little bit of detail that I absolutely love so guys coming on down we are entering a round of Col bloody Buxton this dude is just breaking the bank on me because they keep putting out good pieces I have three t-shirts from them the next this one and the next two are all called Buxton but let's get into this one first I paid forty pounds for this is the Col Buxton week a t-shirt is a lot more of a softer material really just sits on the body great for kind of like every day absolutely love this season my favorite black t-shirt completely it is that oversize fit you guys would be the common theme in pretty much the rest of this is just oversized it's just what I like love tucking it in I love having a little bit of that bagginess it's kind of just my style and personality that I really mess with but yeah very simple cannot go wrong with a nice black shirt especially when you tuck this in to some black smack-heads add some Doc Martens perfect you're good to go again guys called Buxton this is their warm-up t-shirt you guys know I did a full review on this there's the first stop I bought from them 60 pounds still love it to this day I love this is the slate colorway it is a great fit is and like kind of a boxy fit the material is a lot more of that heavy weight and license duty I love how simple this one is yet but because of the way they designed their t-shirt gives it that nice kind of vintage feel so it's a great way to add a little bit of texture to a very simple outfit and yeah it's a good colorway the last of the call back someone same warm up t-shirt this isn't happening the colorway but I call it the concrete one if that's how eyes up do it exact same use the other t-shirt nice heavy weight and yeah just honestly guys the Cole bucks and stuff like I'm not just like saying it for the sake of it like I messed with their stuff and anytime they drop a new t-shirt I'm most likely gonna cop it because this is the type of stuff that's always gonna be in my wardrobe as long as my style stays this way I'll always mess with their stuff so this next one is by Val Christopher I think that was a hundred pounds that is quite pricey but it is so unique and there's a lot that goes into it obviously it's quite a bit more tout oversized bit to it man I've actually been thinking about just doing a full video based on this t-shirt because in this little snippet that I've got it's not enough time but what I do really love about this t-shirt is it's the type of one that I will wear when I want to just make a bit more of a statement when I want a little bit more of a unique standout t-shirt but the reason why this is my top ten is because it's still a very subtle t-shirt yet it has its own amazing uniqueness to it obviously there's the so much going on I kinda just want to do a whole video on this but yeah I love it so for a lot of you oh geez you will remember this t-shirt it is definitely one of my go-to yet because we've been in winter I just don't go out for brighter colors but coming into spring and summer you're gonna see this one a lot more this is my small supreme box logo t-shirt this is what I want to just you know what I want is just be a little bit of a height beast for today I want to just be a supreme head you know I just want to be in that game very subtle very still minimal definitely my style definitely great balance between minimal and you're still in that kind of like Street way scene all right guys on to the second to last one and this is my burnt orange t-shirt again oversized boxy and you may have seen some expensive t-shirts my first t-shirt was 10 pounds from Zara I absolutely love it love the fit of it look the colorway of it perfect when you come into order and perfect when you're in spring summer winter whenever I love it guy size large fits really nicely colors great it's just a really nice way to add color to your outfit but without being too bold all right guys last but certainly not least we started with a fitting t-shirt so we're gonna end with a fitting t-shirt as well it's not always about the oversize fits this is the day's march one you guys would have seen this recently again when I add color to my outfits I like it to be in a more desaturated way love the fit of it I love the cotton love the heavyweight material of this and it's just a really good vibe for about three pounds and there we have it guys those are my top 10 favorite go-to t-shirts that I just always find myself going to let me know in the comment section down below guys what is your favorite go-to t-shirt and where is it from other than that guys I will try link all of

Bob Dole the t-shirt against itself I usually mainly focus on the pits [Music] because of course that's what perspiration happens very good and they'll rub it in and I do that for both mine arms now we're just going to let that soak for a little bit let me get little more water in there as I mentioned cold water dry like this so as you can see the water looks a little bit murky because of course is shirt was dirty and I'm going to check on the other shirts as I mentioned this water is hot we're just gonna do the same thing which allows for this to soak it now again I would not recommend using hot water to do these that of course what this all is about we're gonna test and see which method works best and then Jenny all right so a couple hours have passed since this has been soaking these items are completely done they've actually sat in here a little bit longer they should've I had to tend to some other stuff so I'm hoping these didn't drink at all it looks good that one looks good that one looks good so what we're gonna do with these items is hang dry them [Music] so I dressed in all the gray shirts out of the washer and then hung them on this drying rack that I got from Amazon this is a stainless steel drying rack I'm not sure exactly how much I paid for it but what I'll do is go ahead and drop a link down below so if you're wanting something like this you can find it now we have to dry out this so it's kind of hard to get a good angle on it but when I was doing I would grab a piece twist it fold it twist it fold it twist it and that's usually enough to wring out enough of the water I'm just going to put this on the rack as well and then let it dry overnight so now we're done washing all the gray t-shirts we're gonna go ahead and tackle the black t-shirts and I mentioned earlier I'll have two black t-shirts one of them is a keeping New York everywhere split tee another one is my champion logo black team I originally planned to hand wash one and machine wash the other but it actually got really late I got kind of doing something else and it's like almost 11 o'clock and I don't want to be up all night doing this video so I'm gonna go ahead and toss both of these in the washer before I do that I'm gonna do the same exact thing I did with the great tee and I'm gonna measure to keeping New York everywhere black tee as you can see keeping New York everywhere size large turn it inside out and let's take it to be measured before toss it in the washer don't need a one-handed I know two t-shirts and a washer by yourself is just a waste of water but it's kind of what I got to do I'm just like before one pod and we're gonna keep all this settings the same small delicate tap cold so now that we got the black t-shirts inside to watch her I'm going to go ahead and just hand wash this white t-shirt this is the last one has to be washed this is a white t-shirt from Urban Outfitters so let's do it [Music] alright so now we got the washer going and we got this white tee soaked in so now we're gonna wait for this cycle to be done and about that time I'll go ahead and take the shirt out of the sink alright so now we're gonna hang dry these hang drying is the most essential part of this process alright so lastly we're gonna tackle the white t-shirt and the same no I do have a setting that's going to be a drain and spin setting on my washer so for this one I'm going to utilize that if you don't have a drain and spin setting we're gonna utilize the first method I showed you which is the twist and ring [Music] [Music] as you saw I gave it a little bit of a twist in the sink as you can see it's still pretty wet so we're gonna head and drop this into washer so just gonna toss that in there we're gonna go ahead and twist this to the drain and spin and then see what happens here we go so now it's gonna drain and spin itself and then we can hang that up so it's been about maybe five minutes and I just heard to wash your stop which means this should be fully drain now all right so far so good it's pretty drain and nice and damp and ready to be hung drive the rack is pretty full got one two three four starts here the middle bar has another shirt another shirt oh boom there we go utilize this bar right here alright so all of these shirts are washed they're all drying right behind me I'm gonna get back at you guys tomorrow and then we're going to check it see how they turned out the next day it is officially the next day and the t-shirts have been drying for precisely 21 hours something like that I just got off of work and it's about eight o'clock and if you remember I think I put them to dry maybe a like nine or ten yes about almost 24 hours they are officially dry so let's check them out and Dan we're going to measure same exact t-shirts again to see if they lost any size or quality so let's do it so this was the hand wash t-shirt so he make sure he keep this separate just to remember that was hand washed the rest of these gray shirts were machine wash so I'm just going to compare these two in size because I took measurements of these so machine washed and washed and then we're gonna compare size to the black t as well was it this one yep this one hand washed cold water so a measuring from the top like before so see there all the way down and it is at 30 just a tad bit under so hmm I measured these a mouth will last my little notes here but you see the great teacher we've had at length 30 so let's see if the chest still not 23 and a half so we got the chest starting here 23 and a half so I get to save the state I really didn't lose much size with hand washing and again his home was hand washed in cold water and then hung to dry and now we're gonna test the other gray shirt that was machine wash and then hung dry so the second one just measured out for 29 and a half in a chest both these are the same exact size it looks like we might have lost a half an inch in the length and again this was the one I would machine wash so it's safe to say that the hot water that it did in a wash cycle may have shrunk just a little bit but let's check the chest so the chest is still twenty three and a half inches now to be fair I only measured one of these great t-shirts because since they're the same size I assumed that the dimensions would have been the same but that's false they probably weren't exactly the same so I should have measured both so if we were gonna lose size of the t-shirt we would have lost size from both the chest and length so at this point I don't think that the machine washing affected anything but the true testament will be the black shirt because again that went inside the machine and I did get measurements of that before going in so let's check that [Music] twenty-nine and a half like shirt merchants out at 29 they have and it appears that the black shirt didn't lose any size at all and that was in a machine wash on the dry so in conclusion I would say that it doesn't really matter which method used whether it's gonna be hand washing or machine washes make sure you use cold water and use the delicates settings for your washing machines if you have a washing machine that allows for you to control the temperature through the whole wash make sure you use cold but if it doesn't as you see minded and have those settings and for the most part I didn't lose any quality or size of my T's if you enjoyed this video make sure to leave a thumbs up comment down below and if you're new to the channel make sure you hit the subscribe button and click the

method\nand sublimation printing and what are some key considerations\nto keep in mind so that you can make the right choice for your business although i know there are a lot more\napparel decoration methods that involve printing out there i wanted to\nspecifically cover these two types of printing methods\nbecause both of these methods can be done on the ricoma r550\nwhite toner transfer printer okay so before we jump right in if you're here\nfor the first time or you're new to this channel\nmake sure to smash that subscribe button to keep up to date with the latest\nvideos that come out we post every single week\nalso make sure to give a quick thumbs up to this video if you like content just\nlike this so as i said before i'm going to break\ndown the key differences and considerations for these two types of\nprinting methods but before we get into that i want to\nfirst give a quick intro on what heat transfer printing actually\nis now when we talk about heat transfer printing\nwe're talking specifically about a two-step method so what do those two\nsteps actually involve so step number one in this two-step heat transfer\nprinting method is actually printing a design onto a\ntransparent sheet of transfer paper then in step two\nyou actually transfer that design that was printed on\nthat transfer paper onto an adhesive paper using a heat\npress finally you peel away the adhesive sheet from the transfer\nsheet and then you press the design onto the substrate such as a piece of\ngarment using a heat press after pressing the garment you then peel\naway the actual paper and you're left with a design that's\ntransferred onto the garment itself the ricoma r550 white toner transfer printer\nuses this very two-step heat transfer method\nto apply designs onto various light and dark color garments even onto\nhard surfaces such as wood aluminum or even metal if\nyou're interested to learn more about white toner transfer printing and\nspecifically about the ricoma r550 white toner transfer printer packages\ngo ahead and click the link in the description below and check them out\nthere so now that we cover what is a two-step\nheat transfer printing system let's cover what is sublimation printing\nso sublimation printing involves a similar process where you're\nprinting the design onto regular copy paper or specialty\nsublimation paper and then using heat via a heat press to\ntransfer that printed design onto a substrate such as a piece of\ngarment the key difference lies in how sublimation works and the science behind\nit during sublimation when the actual\nprinted design is heated via a heat press\nthe toner on the transfer paper itself actually turns from\na solid state into a gas state and then it embeds itself\ninto the fabric when it cools it actually goes back to being installed\nand then becomes a permanent part of the fabric that means\nunlike a two-step heat transfer printing method sublimation actually adds no\nadditional layer of paper on top of the fabric and you\ncan't feel the difference of the printed image and the rest of the\nfabric okay now that we've covered what these two methods actually are\nlet's go into some key differences and considerations between these two methods\nthe first topic that we're going to cover between these two methods is\ndurability and feel as i briefly mentioned before sublimation does not\nadd an extra layer on top of your fabric versus a two-step heat transfer printing\nmethod actually leaves a thin layer on top of your fabric\nso the feel is going to be much different so right off the bat you will\nfeel a difference between the printed design using these two\nmethods now in terms of durability with a heat transfer printed design\nit can last about 30 to 40 washes depending on how large your design is\nand how it's actually being washed now on the other hand with sublimation\nbecause the ink or the toner is actually infused inside the fabric and becomes a\npart of the fabric it is a much more permanent design onto\nthe fabric and it can withstand a lot more washes\nin fact most sublimated designs will last just as\nlong as the actual fabric itself because\nyou're not leaving an extra layer of transfer on top of the fabric\nyou're not going to see any cracking after washes and the image is much\nless likely to fade with sublimation so in this category of durability and feel\nit is pretty clear that sublimation wins out in this category because\nit can last a lot longer and you don't feel the actual transfer\nimage on top of the garment alright the second item to consider\nbetween sublimation printing and heat transfer printing\nis the variety of substrates that you can transfer images onto\nwith sublimation printing you are much more limited in\nthe variety of substrates that you can transfer images onto this is because\nsublimation can only adhere to polyester coated materials\neven if you use something that is 60 polyester\nand 40 cotton which is really about the minimum amount of polyester\nthat you need in order to make sublimation work in that 60 40\npoly cotton blend you're not going to get as much vibrancy\nin your transfer design versus 100 polyester\nwith sublimation you also have to use only\nwhite colored substrates or very light colored substrates that means you can't\nuse sublimation on a black t-shirt or a dark mug\nbecause the actual design won't show on the other hand\nwith white toner heat transfer printing you can actually print on light\nand dark colored garments and you're not limited to anything with polyester only\nin fact with heat transfer printing you can heat transfer onto\ncotton onto polyester even ceramic and other hard surfaces like wood and\nmetal and therefore in this category of variety of substrates you can\ntransfer onto heat transfer definitely wins out in\nthis one because of the variety of things that you can do finally let's\ngo into the category of the quality of the colors you can print\nusing these two methods first off sublimation allows you to print full\ncolors and this can be super helpful when\ntrying to sublimate a photo for example or doing a particular job for a customer\nthat requires a very specific color such as one for a company logo you can\nalso achieve sharp vibrant designs using heat\ntransfer paper if you're printing your design\nusing a white toner transfer system such as the ricoma r550 so it really is a\nvirtual tie in this category between sublimation and\nheat transfer printing because you can achieve\nfull color vibrant designs with either method the real difference lies\nin the durability and the feel of either method\nalso the variety of substrates that you can transfer onto but fortunately you\ncan achieve the best of both worlds using a white toner transfer printing\nsystem such as the one that we have here at ricoma the ricoma r550\ni kind of alluded to this briefly in the beginning of the episode\nin that you can achieve sublimation and heat transfer using heat transfer paper\nwith the ricoma r550 and that's because you can actually swap out\none of the toner cartridges in the r550 with a specialty sublimation\ntoner cartridge so in conclusion guys both printing methods\ninvolve a similar process but yield very different results\nhowever in sublimation printing the ink or toner actually permeates\nthroughout the fabric and becomes part of the fabric itself in\ntwo-step heat transfer printing on the other hand the image simply becomes\nanother layer on top of the substrate thankfully the\nricoma r550 white toner transfer printing system\ncan achieve either method simply by swapping out\nthe toner cartridge so make sure you keep these considerations in mind\nwhen deciding which method to use to fulfill the needs of your customers\nat the end of the day it really depends on what your customer is looking for the\ntype of material they're looking to get printed on and that will drive your\ndecision on what is best for your customers\nlike i mentioned before if you're looking to get started in the heat\ntransfer printing business or you're looking to add on

you", "o7vSoC2w_A0": "hey guys we're going to switch gears a bit and we're going to talk about actually sublimation transfers i've been wanting to do a video on how to actually apply the sublimation transfers to a shirt and so i figured this is as good a time as any right okay so few things to know about sublimation okay sublimation is uh dye sublimation is basically just that you're dying fabric um with these uh sublimation transfers okay so one thing to be aware is sublimation does not print white so if you like you see this white right here that's going to be whatever color your shirt is okay so the other thing is you can't dye dark objects lighter you can only dye things darker so that's why it's important for sublimation to use a white or a very light colored shirt because if you put black on a black shirt you're not going to see it if you have pink on a black shirt you're not going to see it so you have to use light or or white as best but white or very light colored shirts as far as um a little bit darker colored shirts if you wanted to do like maybe a like a blue jean color or something like that you can do that but it's best to do that with an all black sublimation transfer black's one of the only colors that you can kind of still see on a darker shirt as long as it's not darker than the black so hopefully that answers some questions about that that's one of the biggest questions we get is why can't you do sublimation on dark shirts it's just because you can't see it so even if the the dye is transferring to it you won't see it on a dark shirt but you will see it on a white or a very light colored shirt the other thing to be aware of for sublimation is sublimation dyes only adhere to polyester fibers so what happens is when the dyes get heated up heat it up it actually infuses into the polyester so the more polyester content that you have in your shirt or um whatever you're pressing the brighter and bolder the colors are so if you have like a 50 polyester shirt with 50 cotton it's not gonna stick to the cotton but it will stick to the polyester so it'll be like a faded look so that's another thing to keep in mind the higher the polyester count in your fabric the brighter and bolder the colors will be another thing about sublimation is before you press it the colors are going to look really muted especially like blues and mints turquoise those colors will look completely different after you press it's weird so don't freak out whenever you print out your sublimation if you're doing it at home or even if you order one and it looks completely different it changes once it's heated it gets a lot more bolder brighter vivid and the blues and greens those change a lot so hopefully that answers a few questions okay oh another thing for sublimation you want to use a heat press or you can use the easy press 2 because you need 400 degrees fahrenheit and iron will not work unless you're doing like a little bitty tiny thing because you don't want to move it around at all when you press it you want to keep it like and not move it like it's got to stay still so easy press 2 will work because it does get hot enough or heat press is definitely definitely recommended iron and sublimation just do not mix okay so here are some other tips and tricks okay sublimation will go through your shirt okay so you always want to put something in between your shirt or you want to actually thread your shirt onto your press rather than just putting this on here like this pressing it because you're going to see this mama bear transfer all the way through to the back especially for thin shirts so anytime you're using sublimation you always want to protect your press with protective paper and then you always want to protect the inside of your shirt if you're not threading it through so for this one when i say threading it through i just mean opening the shirt and putting it on your press where only one layer of the shirt is on there that's always the ideal way to press if you can because then you don't have any seams messing you up or anything like that so this would be considered a threaded shirt all right so we're going to go ahead and put our shirt on here i'm going to move it to where the collar is not actually on the press anytime you're pressing it's always good to not have the collars or the seams on the press because anything like that can make it where your shirt isn't getting full pressure okay this is a bella canvas let me see this is a bella canvas shirt and it is i want to say 50 polyester 65 actually 65 polyester you want to have at least 50 but like i said the higher the polyester count the bolder and brighter these colors will be all right so we got our shirt on there we have our protective paper right now i'm just going to use this teflon sheet just to do a quick pre-press to get any moisture out of it all right remove that now here's another thing to be aware of for sublimation you'll notice that it's on this square okay now lighter colored shirts usually won't happen but if you're using like a more colored shirt a lot of times if you just put this down and you press it like that you're going to see that square so a good habit to always be in is anytime you're pressing sublimation just loosely cut around your image it just will soften that edge and just make it look a lot nicer another thing is if you're printing your own sublimations or ordering them sometimes whenever it's going through the printer you'll get little bitty dots of ink on the edge if you don't cut those edges off there's a chance that you won't see it and you'll miss it and you'll have like these weird little black lines okay and this does not have to be perfect this is just loosely cutting around so that you can really see where your image is and that you won't have that box around your sublimation okay um let me get one more thing one second okay okay another thing you always want to do before you're pressing a sublimation is use a lint roller and just get any loose fibers or anything like that off your shirt because sometimes if you have some loose fibers or anything like that you'll see these weird little blue and red marks after you press it because we're pressing for a for a full minute for sublimation so any of those little things getting pressed at 400 degrees for a minute can actually change colors and permanently affect your shirt and your outcome okay so we have our shirt ready we have it pre-pressed we have it lint rolled we have our transfer cut out our shirt is at least 50 polyester is 65 so we're gonna put the transfer face down okay so the ink side will be on the shirt now from here you don't want to put a teflon sheet straight on your transfer because what happens is once the ink um gets heated up and turns into a gas and any extra will kind of dissipate so if you use a teflon sheet that extra ink will just kind of sit on your teflon sheet and you'll need to clean your teflon sheet if not you won't notice it until you go to press something else and that ink will actually transfer onto something else so always use some protective paper you can even use um regular like copy paper is totally fine to just put on top okay so we're just gonna put a couple sheets of copy paper on there we're gonna take our teflon sheet and we're gonna cover it all with that okay and we're going to be pressing for 60 seconds at 400 degrees okay and y'all just be careful once this is done it will be hot so just be prepared for that okay once this is done you just want to remove your transfer immediately not let it move and then sit somewhere else or you get like a ghosting all right remove that and that is it so here is our sublimated shirt mama bear this particular design is available on the website as a digital download and it also is available as a ready to press transfer so that is sublimation is super easy it's not just for fabrics you can use it for any polyester coated item so there's tons like there's tumbler cups there's a whole bunch of stuff that you can use um sublimation for as far as washing this is permanent you can wash it and dry it like normal no issues and it will last a long time the other question i get a lot of times too is can you reuse the transfers they're not really made to be reused but sometimes like a darker transfer like this if you're okay with a much lighter version you can put it on there and press it again it won't be as bold and vibrant as the first one but you will still get some ink transfer but just be aware you know if you don't like it you can't take it off so definitely sublimation is permanent the amazing thing is sublimation it has no feel to it so all it does is it actually changes the color of the fabric so i hope this was helpful you guys we get so many questions about sublimation on the website you can order custom sublimations if you have an image that you want printed or if you have questions on how to print your own you're welcome to message us we can give you some recommendations of some good printers and good machines if you all have any questions please comment down below i will try to answer them as as best as i can to as best of my ability as i can but i hope this video was helpful i appreciate you guys watching don't forget to like and

we're going to talk about the different printing techniques and discuss which fabrics are best with which techniques we're going to cover pasta solving water based discharge sublimation DTG and heat press and talk about which of those techniques work on each of our different fabrics stay tuned so let's start with a hundred percent cotton islander percent cotton is pretty much the easiest fabric to work with industry printing world and it works with pretty much every single technique except sublimation pauses all ink is typically the easiest type of seam to use in the screen printing world and it works great on a huge range of fabrications including a hundred percent cotton so with class assault me you're gonna have a hand to me name the ink lays on top of the garment it works great with hundred-percent Compton along with all that that works interacts with the cotton you're not gonna have to worry about dye migration dye migration is something that happens with polyester and I'll touch on that later but because of that it's gonna work great with it too before cotton white classes all aim this thing's great because it's got a lighter hand to it than some of the inks with poly darkness another technique we love for a hundred percent cotton is water-based so all of our cotton is 100% combed in ring-spun meaning that's got a super soft hand and what water-based is if that is absorbed into the actual fibers at the cotton you're not going to feel it like you will it pass us all in this field the exact same as a regular shirt we feel with no print on it so water base is great for any light-colored Cotton's or any darker colors as long as you're using a shade darker you can't use a leg water basing on its dark fabric for that effect you're gonna want to use a discharge discharge ink is kind of like the complement to water based ink but it's used on dark fabrics so in the sense that you don't feel a water-based print in terms of the hand same goes for discharge with discharge it's gonna work best on 100% cotton compared to you know your tribe lines or your heather's but something you will want to be careful with the test for is on different colors each color is going to take that discharge agent differently so make sure to do a wide range of testing before moving forward with like a big full quarter of a specific discharge print another thing to keep in mind is discharge doesn't work on that garments there's not enough contrast so with a light garment you're gonna want to use water base with a dark garment you're gonna want to use the district this is another discharge print that we did with actual colors so with this one the discharge agent removes all of the pigment from the gray fabric and replaced it with these colors like for the whites and the reds that you see in this print here so let's move on to DG ECG stands for a direct to garment printing we've done a few videos about this in the past and it works best with 100% cotton t-shirt 100% cotton is pretty much the DTG printers ideal garment with these TG is really important more so than the spring hunting to have a really really smooth surface you want to make sure you use a comb to ring-spun garment so a bell on campus is a favorite for GDQ printers as well here's another DTG print with a dart garment you're gonna want to lay down a face and like Kermit you can just go ahead and print the ink directly on the shirt with you to do so he transfers the next process we're going to talk about it also is super easy with 100% cotton heat transfer is if you place the vine olive oil a little variety of different types of heat transfer effects but basically with this you're going to just die when I heat press it for about 15 seconds for a 320 degrees which is pretty standard and the heat press cool lastly we have sublimation so sublimation is a process that only works on polyester so you can sublimate at all on a hundred percent cotton t-shirts so we don't have an example to show you about we will later in the video with so next we're going to cover Heather C we see how their CPC is another favorite among printers and it typically takes a pretty similar to our 100% cotton typically with Heather's you have to worry about the dye migration and polyester coming through ink when you're using classed assault but we did some extensive testing on all of our feathers and found that they were pretty much just as well with cotton white as they do with an ink with a poly blocker with a 50/50 or a poly so what that means for use free printers out there is you can use a more standard name with a softer hand and not have to worry about dye migration like you usually do with Heather's and that's pretty exclusive to the fella canvas collection the same might not hold true for other brands with plastic saw ink we like to use kind of a thinner lines on it that will keep the original feel of the garment showing below but you can also do like a full cover plastisol this technique is really popular especially with kind of like street programs so for this one we have like a puff ink below and this like full coverage class all sudden people like the feel of a print so it really comes down to customer preference on that one so next let's talk about water me spinning with water base it typically comes down more to the color of the garment then the actual fabric so light colored Heather will take water-based paint very similar to a light colored solid we love the feel again because your so discharge printing on Heather's won't work as well as discharge printing on 100% cotton because that discharge agent only works with the cotton fibers of the shirt so it's really going to come down to the color here's some prints that we did with just a discharge each end and you're still going to get a light in effect which is great but it's just really important to do your testing and know that you're not going to get as bright of a discharge result with Heather's as you would as 100% cotton DTG is another printing technique that works better on 100% cotton but it's also possible with Heather's with this technique you're going to really need to do you're testing a polyester yarns we'll take the BT GE differently than 100% cotton so with this print here we got a great result but it took the printer a lot of Rd to come up with the right amount of pretreat and the right ink settings to achieve this effect another thing you want to be careful with when DTG printed on any blends is make sure to wash and scratch test it because someone that ink might come off in the washer when you're scratching it it's not as durable on the synthetic yarns as it is on the natural under the second option moving on to tiger tribe ones are one of the softest fabrics on the market but because there are three types of yarns the poly cotton and rayon and each take it differently printing on them can be trickier than printing on the fabric so you've covered up until this point however as consumer preference continues to trend for the softer garment it's important to know how to print on tribal ones and choose an ink that complements garment so because try one is largely a synthetic fabric you do have to be aware of dye migration again this will really come down to color we tested all of our try once with three types of ink cotton white 50/50 and poly white and we'll be releasing those printing tips on our site by the end of the year but what we did notice across the board is some on some try blends the cotton II work just fine where other colors didn't need a Polliwog here to stop that dye migration from coming through the e so you can see on the blue the results vary a little bit and you actually do need that Holly Walker ink to stop the dye migration whereas the some colors like this play you'll find the 50/50 in the cotton whitening perform pretty much to say on some try ones you'll need to use your gray under base to prevent any dye migration with some of the trickier colors also another tip to keep in mind is using a stretch additive or softener will help keep the stretch with the garment in the soft hand feel we're pretty impossible tripods already have a super soft hands so you don't want to print a bulletproof shield on it we lot of water-based ink for this reason my moms will take water basing pretty similar to 100% cotton we did a past video about doing water base and discharge printing on our heather solids and try it once and you can see there wasn't too much difference between our solid men and our min tripod with water base you always want to be aware of the color different colors will interact they eat differently so make sure to test first discharge printing will also work on tripods but you're not going to get as bright as an effect as you would with 100% cotton so the end result will be a more muted effect you can see this print is with the discharge agent only and this has been discharged plus color added so you're gonna definitely get more of a muted effect than you would on 100% cotton with this charge director garment is usually not recommended on trial on fabric however the Bella cam is tri-blend reacts differently than most brands because the synthetic material acts more like a cotton than a plastic we also have the super soft surface for our dry ones compared to some other brands so it is possible to get a great DTG print but again like with Heather's you're going to want to do a lot of wash testing and scratch testing and basically a lot of Rd to get the levels right it's not going to be as easy as 100% cotton so we do recommend this technique on try blends for expert dgg printers only you can also keep press on our tribe lens one thing you'll have to be aware of is because there's a lot of synthetic material you'll want here it at a lower temperature and for a less amount of time so we usually recommend about 280 degrees for 8 to 10 second so because our time moms are 50% polyester it's actually a really good candidate for sublimation if you're looking for more of a vintage effect so with sublimation the ink is gonna adhere to the polyester fibers only so with this we had a much brighter print and this is after a wash you can see it's got more of this vintage faded effect which is really popular and a try one will feel a lot nicer than 100% polyester shirts so if you're a sublimation printer out there I definitely recommend experimenting with there try buns another cool thing is we're one of the whole new brands to have solid try blends so our solid white try blend is really great for sublimation now moving on to my personal favorite fabrication flowy color business flow is one of our best-selling collections because it's one of the softest fabrics we have but because it's made of synthetic fibers polyester and viscose and it doesn't have the cotton that printers are used to usually working with we know can be intimidating for some printers out there so definitely check out last week's video if you want to learn more about what I'm about to cover pasta salting works great on flowy it's one of the ideas to work with something to keep in mind if you're using pasta sauce Inc is you want to try to keep the original feel of the garment so you can do that by adding in a softener or a stretch palliative and on some darker colors you're also going to want to use the Polly bark of these water base contain is another technique that works really great on our Chloe colleague visco it's gonna keep the soft hand of the original permit so we love this when you're working with artwork that has more coverage like these butterflies here the whites are going to be more vibrant as with any water-based printing than some of your lighter colors that go grey so discharge printing won't work on Chloe poly viscose because there's no cotton content for the discharge agent to remove so if you're working with a darker color garment and you want to get the stopped and effect of a discharge print we recommend this water-based technique that we actually featured in last week's video so what we did is use a water-based poly blocker base and then use a water-based ink on top this print here has an amazing feel and amazing stretch and it's done with water-based ink on clothing when it comes to DC depending on the flow this is another one where we've seen really awesome results so DC you turning on our Chloe is recommended for experts only but because this is such a popular fabrication and you are interested and learning some tricks for how to do it you can check out one of our past videos double link in the description keep pressing on Chloe is actually pretty similar to try one because it's more of a synthetic material you're gonna want to heat transfer at lower temperatures less time some people might not think to sublimate on our poly viscose but it is actually an awesome proverb for that there's much more polyester content than the Pittsburgh one so you're going to get a brighter print than you saw earlier so this is 65% polyester so it's not going to be as bright as a hundred percent polyester but it feels amazing and the colors are only going to be slightly more muted than they would be with 100% polyester and you're going to get a garment that customers respond to a lot better than 100% poly and you can see you can also sublimate on lighter colors like a speech polyester is really big in the athletic market and while we don't have any under percent polyester T's in our Bella canvas line Bella campus also is a line Club allspark so we're gonna touch on the printing techniques you can do with poly using our pulse Portland so with 100% poly you're gonna want to use a plastic salty you definitely have to be aware of dye migration since the shirt is 100% polyester so you're going to want to use the poly e and/or a poly walker base as well just depending on color and if you're seeing the new documentation come through you won't really get great results using a water-based ink on 100% poly and discharge won't work at all because there's no cotton content in 100% poly shirt with etg we've heard it is possible on 100% poly but it's definitely tricky and we definitely don't recommend it as the most DTG from the fabric when you keep pressing on in a percent polyester just make sure you're using a material that's resistant to dye migration sublimation is really great because the ink actually becomes the part of the original garment so it similar to a water-based ink you're not going to feel the sublimation print out we hope you enjoyed this video we obviously couldn't cover a lot of the intricacies involved in each of these printing techniques this is meant to be more of a broad overview so make sure to do your own testing also make sure to ask any questions that you have in the comments below I'll try to get back to you and subscribe to

and if you're already a dreamer welcome back welcome back welcome back so today we are going to be going over how to sublimate on white glitter vinyl so i'm really really excited today i have two projects i'm going to be doing i'm going to be printing this out on a square image and i'm going to be printing this image out on a circle so i'm going to show you two different ways to do it um the circle my best friend wants me to make this for her so i literally made this design myself for her and i'm using a circle template i'm going to use white vinyls white glitter vinyl and what i'm going to do is i'm going to print this out in silhouette because i'm in silhouette studio so i'm going to print this out in silhouette at 9.336 inches around and then i'm going to print the circle and glitter out a little bit above it now typically you put the image larger than the glitter but i'm going to do this one is going to be smaller because it doesn't really matter now i'ma show you how it matters when i do the other image i'm going to do so i printed this out in silhouette studio and then in cricut i'm going to show you how i printed this we are in cricut design space and i'm printing this circle at 9.5 and that's what it is all the way around now honestly it didn't matter because the background is white and the blue and the glitter is white so i could have made it the exact same size larger smaller etc but i i put it on top of each other i put the image here now you know you can't print out actual print and cut designs out larger in cricut so what i did was i put it inside of here so i could see how the image would be when i printed it out and i wanted it smaller versus larger with the circle because i'm gonna have to cut the circle around because i do have a cameo but i haven't set it up yet so i don't um know how to use it so i don't want to make it larger and then my outside circle is off i made it smaller so i'm going to hand cut around my circle and if it's off it's not going to matter because it's going to be inside of the glitter i hope that makes sense so that's why i made it different so this is going to be my first design i'm going to do when you do this you want to make sure that you heat your shirts up a little bit it gets any type of moisture out so i heat my shirt up as well as i use a lint brush so i want to make sure everything is going to be nice and smooth on there okay so that's what i do so i'm going to show you typically we use the lint roller to get any type of lint or dust or anything off of the shirt and then we typically you can use a teflon or butcher paper if you want but i know nothing's on my pad so i'm just heating up my shirt and what this does is it one gets the wrinkles out and then two it takes out any absorption any moisture anything like that some people do some people don't i typically do depending on the shirt how i want the images and things to stick so there's a good lint roller and then we have go ahead and get that out so that's how we do that once we do that i'm going to go ahead and um put the vine the glitter the white glitter vinyl on top of the shirts so i have two black shirts i'm going to be using i'm going to use white glitter vinyl on both one is going to be a circle one is going to be a square okay now for the second image i got this image off of google i'm not going to be selling this this is just for tutorial purposes but this is good old nipsy hustle if anyone knows me they know i love nipsey i'm so devastated about his passing i just continue to grieve which is so weird but i'm just like hurt anywho so this is um an artwork that is done outside of the marathon clothing nipsey hustle as you can see victory that it is so dope so i'm so excited to do this image now for this image this is how you typically do all of your cover up vinyl i'm sorry all of your layer glitter white vinyl with an image you want to make sure that the image is a little bit bigger than the vinyl and the reason you want to do that is because i'm using white vinyl this picture is not white like my other image so i wanted to cover up as much of the white vinyl as possible so it can look smooth and clear and crisp okay so for this image the um inches are 9.435 and height and 9.59 inches in width okay so that's what i'm doing for the image and i'm going to show you once again we're in silhouette studio because this is the only one that can print this large and then for um for the actual white glitter vinyl we can print out of cricut so i'm going to show you what that looks like okay so i'm inputting the image inside of cricket i'm saving it as a print and cut image and then i'm going to go ahead and upload the image and it's going to take a minute okay so i'm going to unlock the image when you unlock the image it lets you change it to the size that you want so if you remember in silhouette it is 9.435 in height or we can just type it at the top 9.435 and then with it is 9.594 so i'm going to press enter and then it's going to change the image so now we can actually put the image on top of each other to see exactly how much space is going to be so i technically could make my um image either a little bit bigger or i could make my vinyl a little bit smaller so you can do this so you can know for sure i'm not sorry i'm not showing you you can do this so you can know for sure so i think i'm going to make my glitter behind the image a little bit smaller because i want to make sure it covers it up a hundred percent completely okay so the picture can be a little bit larger we're gonna lock and load it and then that's we're gonna do so i'm gonna just cut a little bit of my vinyl off the glitter vinyl off so that it can be a little bit smaller than the actual photo okay so that's how you could always check it but as you know in cricut it will not print because it's too um because it's too large okay but we will print it out in silhouette alright so i'm gonna go ahead and start putting the glitter on the shirts and then i'm going to go ahead and then sublimate on top of the white glitter vinyl now i've used several different brands so it doesn't matter scissor is a great brand i always use that one a lot um i've tried other brands that i needed i tried cricut when i was like in a jam um i've tried other brands and they all seem to work for me but i believe scissor is the best brand um there is another brand i really like and i i have to find what the name of that is but yep so i'm going to go ahead press the glitter down and then i'm going to sublimate on top of that if you have any questions comments any easier tips anything please let me know okay so i have this it's like i create ruler by tam sweet life so if you wanted you could go to tamsuitelife.com um or follow her on ig by tam's sweet life that's i'll put it in the comments says b y t a m s s w e e t l i f e anywho so i use that to make sure it's perfect and because i'm a little bit ocd i also use this t ruler just to make sure that each side is exactly where it needs to be now each image will be a little bit different um and each size of the shirts may be a little bit different so this is a circle so it's a little bit different anywho i'm going to go ahead and press this on um yeah so i told you i have uh yet learned how to use my cameo so i'm literally oh the vinyls on the shirt it's nice and pretty so i'm learning how to um i haven't learned how to use my cameo so i'm going to just cut around the circle and that's why i gave it some wiggle room because i'm like i don't want to mess this up for my best friend but i don't know how to cut it out of pricking it so i'm just cutting it around and then i'm going to lay it on top and she's going to have her shirt that she wanted the other shirt is going to be a little bit different because it's square so squares i have a paper cutter that i could use to do that i mean or i could use it by hand as well but that's that thank you no i don't like it so i'm going to make it bigger so i'm printing out of my workforce epson workforce epson 72 i'm sorry printed out of my work for 7720 series popping colors cassette 2 that's my preset and i'm printing it out you should hear it in the background if you want to know what my presets are you can watch my how to sublime beginners video you can watch that again if you guys want me to i can make another one but i've already made it so it's kind of like i don't want to be redundant keep repeating myself so go ahead and watch that but i'm printing it out because i needed it to be a little bit larger so i printed it out this one is a little bit better but honestly i could have used more space i'm also noticing if you haven't noticed your um designs and cricut and this silhouette don't match up so my inches i've noticed they don't match up i know someone previously told me in my comments to make sure that um i think she said something like tapering off the image or something something like that but i have to look that up a little bit more to figure out what it is i have to do to make sure that the designs line up but this will work because it's literally just going to be glitter all around it so it's not going to matter but for my other image i'm going to have to make sure that it's perfect like i need it to be perfect like i needed to be but this one is perfectly fine for right now because it's just going to be white glitter around it and i already told her how the image would be and she agreed so that's not a problem at all so yeah so we're going to go ahead and take this down and i'm going to put it on 400 for 60 seconds that's what i'm going to sew now here i'm just measuring everything from the top making sure that everything is going to be the correct amount of inches from the top and the bottom that i want it to be so you could play around with it i'm like i said a perfectionist so when i do things i want to be as close as perfect as possible even though i am hand making it and human error you know but i try to make things okay so i use a sub paper as you can see and i use cosmos oh yeah okay so there we go i have it on 400 degrees for 60 seconds and this is the image that i created for my best friend well my boss friend that's what we call each other all right so that's how it looks now i'm going to do my second image on the square inch but it looks good i hope she like so i'm literally just cutting a little bit of it off so that i can have a little bit more of this overlapping the vinyl so i want to have the picture a little bit bigger than the vinyl so i'm taking just a little bit off so that it can overlap it a little bit so i'm taking it off on both sides the width and the height just a little bit okay so i've always been a person who i can eyeball things and look at things and know exactly how much to take off i don't know how i don't know if it's the photographer in me but i can look at things and see if they're like crooked or fix things just visually so i don't know how much i took off i just eyeballed it okay so now before i even put it on a shirt i see that it's a little bit overlapping and that's what i need because i don't want to see any of the white vinyl and excuse my niece in the background baby sitting in my knee so my daughter and is playing with my niece so that's what you hear in the background so anywho this is going to be perfect so now i'm going to press this on the shirt and then i'm going to press sub this one you see i got my ring light i got my ring light i have my [Music] tammysuitelife.com create ruler and i have my t ruler so i'm making sure that this is correctly in the middle so that it won't have any issues or problems and now i can go ahead press it and then i'll sub on top and yes i do use heat tape this tape is from amazon it came in a two pack um and this yellow is never transferred on anything of mine i've heard people say that it's transferred so until it does i'm gonna keep using it i may try a clear one they have blue ones they have all types but this is the one that i use and i've never had any issues from amazon so gonna go ahead and press it down now for real okay so here's something that i noticed depending on the brand of um white glitter that you'll be using it may have like this has little like lines in it it's not a bad thing it's not going to mess my images up but i did notice that so if you can see you see that it's like lines so that's going to come up in the image so that's okay so that's what i said you may want to play around this is not scissor brand i honestly have to look and see my friends tell me to try this brand out so i'm trying to get out my home girl hey girl tell me to try it out so i'm trying it out and um so it's not scissor i have to see what the name of it is but it has a little line so the image is gonna have those little lines but like i said that's perfectly okay i'm trying to think of other things i may have missed previously things i'm trying so if you can't see the entire image what i'm doing is i apologize but i'm just going the sides and making sure that it's overlapping on all four corners so that there won't be any white hopefully around the sides you don't want to see any of the white glitter because it's a color image so i'm just making sure that it's overlapping and the ink will get on the black but it's okay because it's blue and then hopefully it won't hopefully it may come out because that's not polyester so it shouldn't be an issue okay so i'm going to take this down sup i'm doing the glitt white glitter at the 3 30 for 15 seconds i'm on the heat press and then this i'm summing at 400 for 60 seconds okay so as i always say it's always more than one way to skin a cat this is how i tape it down i want to make sure all of my corners are taped down so that it can make sure that it absorbs and all of the white glitter i literally lifted each side up made sure that it was a little bit over the edge of each of the sides so i'm feeling really confident about it and i'm going to go ahead and sub it now like i said at 400 degrees for 60 seconds if you guys have any other tips or tricks please share thank y'all for sharing some of y'all are hitting me up on facebook instagram some of you guys are um commenting under my videos let me go check these babies out yeah so i got this nifty little thing from amazon it's by bryco goods and what this is is it holds my um butcher paper and then i can tear it off it would normally press this for 60 seconds at 400. right i have to loosen the tape up a little bit it's hot but i cannot wait to see this finished product i loosened up some of this tape and i'm gonna look and see oh yeah it's literally perfect and i don't say things that perfect [Music] i did so good guys i'm so happy because i'm like i'm doing the tutorial and i hope it'll come out right [Music] and then oh you got all that ink off here baby yes it's acer paper 125 grams cosmo ink on top of white glitter vinyl so yeah so here's the finished product i told you i used asa paper cosmo ink white glitter vinyl i hope you guys enjoyed it i hope it made sense if you guys have any questions comments concerns please go ahead and let me know if you want me to go over anything else let me know that as well but um if you know any other tips

test we're going to be looking at the quality of the fabrics the sewing how they fit the comfort and also comparing the sustainability and ethics of each brand as you can see this is a long video i go into a lot of the different details and aspects of these brands so if you're only interested in certain parts i will include time codes down below so you can skip around to the parts you're interested in or if you want to just jump to my final thoughts you can do that as well so let's get right into it first at the lowest price point we have this t-shirt from everlane and be sure to stick around to later to hear my thoughts on everlane's ethics then there is this t-shirt from pact and they actually don't carry this exact style anymore but they have a lot of different basics i have this t-shirt from cotton and i hope it doesn't get too confusing with a brand named cotton because we're also going to talk about cotton the material a bit then there's this tea from armed angels because i wanted to have some europe-based brands as well and finally our highest priced t-shirt is this one from organic basics i tried to get the most basic style of t-shirt each brand had and ordered them all in a size medium the first thing i did when they arrived is measure each one to see how they compare to each other and also how they compare to the brand's size guide this chart shows the measurements of each one and the largest and smallest tea in each area i also should note that pack shrunk the most after washing quite a lot in length and everlane and organic basics didn't really shrink at all okay so i have the t-shirts here and they have all been washed once with cold water and air dry but i wanted to wait to do first impressions until after they were washed because quite often things can shrink or shift i have definitely had that experience where a fabric feels super soft in the store and then when you take it home and wash it it feels completely different so the first really obvious difference is the thickness and weight of the fabric the everlane t-shirt which is also the cheapest one is definitely the thinnest fabric it's extremely lightweight very kind of gauzy the armed angels one is also very lightweight but the knit is a little denser then we have the pack t-shirt in the middle and then the organic basics and the cotton t-shirt are quite a bit denser while they are about the same thickness the organic basics one is softer while the cotton one is a stiffer knit the everlane packed and organic basics are softer than the armed angels and the cotton but they might soften up over time they only have been washed once it's not like an uncomfortable stiffness just when you compare them so i've just laid them out from cheapest to most expensive because it is important to keep price in mind because this one is half of the cost of this one so you know there are going to be quality differences just based on that but the next thing i want to compare is construction and what i have noticed is they all have this piece of fabric along the back of the neck which is really good but then if we go into the t-shirts and inspect the shoulder seams the brands have done different things so the everlane shirt is just surged there's nothing else added to the shoulder seam and that's a common place that tends to stretch out at least when i was studying clothing construction we were told to always do something to kind of reinforce the shoulder seam the pack shirt has a piece of elastic sewn in this type of elastic is used a lot in clothing construction and it's added as they're serging the seam to provide some extra support and help with retention the cotton shirt also doesn't have anything added but because this is a much more dense knit i'm not actually sure that this necessarily needs some extra support the lighter and looser it is i would say the more likely it is to actually need some support so the everlane shirt i would be much more concerned about it stretching out versus this one now what armed angels has done is a clever finishing trick where they've actually put a strip of the same fabric and this is great because you're not using extra plastic which this kind of elastic is so this is still totally cotton but it is a slightly higher cost way of finishing it because you do have to cut that strip and line it all up versus just using the elastic and then the organic basics t also doesn't have anything in that seam but again i'm not necessarily sure that this one needs it because it is a denser knit and because this one actually has spandex in it it probably is a lot better at retaining that seam so even though at the higher price point i do think it would be good to maybe see a bit of extra reinforcement i'm not sure if it's actually necessary other than that all these t-shirts are basically sewn and finished the same way something to point out on this packed shirt is the hem is sort of twisting basically it wasn't a even fold it was somehow offset slightly when they sewed it when we compare the stitching the armed angels shirts and the organic basics shirt definitely have a much tighter stitch which is generally a sign of higher quality just because the looser the stitches the faster you can sew something and it's a lot less thread less cost that kind of thing so especially with fast fashion you'll see a really wide stitches often just because it makes it cheaper and faster to sew none of these stitching i would say is bad or too loose but you definitely do notice that the packed and the cotton shirt in particular have wider stitching than the armed angels and the organic basics okay so now i'm going to lay each one out flat just look at how it's cut how it sits and what we want to see is a good shape we want it to look pretty even we don't want anything looking off or crooked okay so the first thing i notice after lying the everlane shirt out flat kind of blocking it out is that we are seeing a little bit of twisting in the side seam so the seams should run perfectly straight this seam in particular starts off at the side and then as we get to the bottom it's sort of curving in a little bit so when you look at a knit fabric there are tiny tiny little lines called whales that run up and down the shirt and that needs to be cut straight or you get this kind of twisting and what also has resulted from that is that one of the shoulders is more forward and one of the shoulder seams is more back so basically we end up with a bit of a battle where if i try to get the shoulders perfectly straight and flat then my side seams are off and if i line my side seams up nice and flat then the shoulders are off so there's definitely something that's cut a little bit crooked with the pattern but what i want to point out though is that that is not really uncommon with knits especially something like a t-shirt and because this is the lowest price point shirt i mean i'm not that surprised i wouldn't say this is something that you would return it honestly most people probably wouldn't even notice unless you really kind of laid it out and blocked it out this isn't something that you would notice when it was on the hem looks pretty good it's about an inch shorter in the front than the back which is fairly common some brands do that with their t-shirts and yeah it's a pretty typical straight t-shirt construction okay so then we're gonna move on to the pack t-shirt this one is a v-neck unlike the others so it is going to be slightly different in terms of its construction okay now right away i'm noticing quite a bit of that twisting that i was talking about with the everlane this one actually has it even more it's actually twisting about an inch on each side which depending on the brand that could be within quality control tolerance and that would of course explain what i mentioned that it looked like the hem was slightly twisted i think it's just because the whole piece has been cut slightly off and this shirt i believe will try to straighten out the side seams is cut with a bit of a curve to it so it's a more fitted cut i find the armhole interesting on this packed shirt it comes in at kind of a i think sort of a unique curve for an armhole so you end up with some extra fabric under the arm here which might be good for certain fit elements and again we'll have to try it on and see how it fits if there is some extra bulkiness under the arm but it's just something i definitely noticed this one is hemmed slightly shorter than i believe all these other ones usually higher quality stuff will have a bit larger seam allowances yeah i'm just curious to see what this one's going to look like on to see if we're going to notice any of those things or not but then we have the cotton shirt and like i said earlier this is a stiffer a bit more dense shirt so we should be seeing a pretty clean even because this kind of fabric is going to be easier to cut it's going to be less likely to twist and stretch out if you want a really light drapey loose knit it does come with maybe some more quality issues maybe some more pattern issues where something is pretty dense and structured will often give you a better shape and it usually is more durable however you don't get that really soft loose drapey look okay so with this shirt we're getting really nice flat even side seams which is good to see this pattern has been cut straight the neckline also looks pretty good it's lying nice and flat there is a tiny bit of puckering or bunching along the back here especially where the tag is i'm probably being too nitpicky because this is a casual piece it's not supposed to look pristine and perfect you know it's not like we're comparing something that is very tailored or very structured like a button-up shirt and let me know if you would like to see a video like this about a different piece so these kinds of things like having a little bit of bunching along the back doesn't really make a difference you're not going to notice it so this one also does have a slightly curved side seam and this one is cut perfectly straight along the bottom there's nothing else really of a note for this shirt so we're gonna move on to the armed angels one this one like the packed one also has that same higher cut armhole with a bit of extra fabric this is the only one that isn't top stitched along the neckline and so what's happening is the serging at the front here is flipping up a bit we're gonna have to try it on to see how that exactly sits we've got that extra fabric in the shoulder which i really like okay so let's move on to our final one so this is the organic basics tee so this one and the everlane one are both cut straight so this is interesting so this one is actually cut with slightly more fabric in the front than the back so when you lay out the side seams the front rolls over ever so slightly because there's a bit more fabric and that is good design because with women's bodies you have more body in the front than you do in the back so the neckline and this one is slightly lower than the other crewnecks but it is lying beautifully flat and something that's interesting with this one in particular is the shoulder seam is actually set back slightly and that is a good thing because again when we're talking about you know how the body is distributed you have more up front than you do in the back so if you set the seam actually slightly back it tends to sit right at the top of the shoulder versus it being slightly more forward with clothing you don't want to actually see the shoulder seam on the front of the shoulder so it's better to set it back slightly and then it's sitting at the top or slightly hidden over the back of the shoulder it's not something that you would typically do with a t-shirt that's more for tailored garments but i like the fact that they have set back the seam slightly overall fabric and construction my first impression is that the organic basics tee is better quality but it also is the higher price point one so i would expect and hope that it is better quality so for the fabric and construction quality here is how i would rank them i think pact and everlane are both tied for the bottom place because while everlane had better construction pact had better quality fabric i do want to note though that pact seems to be kind of hit or miss with their sewing because when i ordered this t-shirt i also ordered a couple other pieces just to show you here's the sewing on one of my pack tank tops and there is a noticeable difference and i've heard this from others as well where some of their packed pieces are great while others have issues so i don't know if it's just the factory where this t-shirt's sewn and maybe their other pieces are sewn somewhere else or what's going on but if you are interested in packed i would encourage you to read reviews because some of their pieces are definitely sewn better than others okay so now i'm gonna compare the fit of them on first up is the everlane tee and i don't know if you guys can tell but you can definitely see where my pants are just color wise so that is indicative of the fabric not being very thick i do have a nude bra on i probably should have worn like a black bra but based on the fact that you can see my pants through it i would definitely say that you could probably see a bra through it so the fabric is not very thick it is really nice and soft though now i do have pretty broad shoulders so with all of these they're probably gonna sit a little bit high but it doesn't feel tight across here which is the biggest thing that i would look for these are all a size medium and with most brands i am between a size small and medium depending on the waist and the bust so these are a slightly looser fit i would say typically than if i went with a small but that's what i like with t-shirts another thing that we're going to try to look for is that the arm sits nice so it should sit nice and straight not really wing out at all we also want to check that the neckline looks pretty good and straight which it does and also that the hips aren't too tight and i think that that is pretty comfortable so yeah i don't have any fit complaints with this i think it fits pretty well my biggest issue with it is just the sheerness and the thinness of the fabric okay so now i have the pack t-shirt on so this is the one where the fabric was twisting the most if you look at the side seam it looks pretty straight you wouldn't notice it what you do notice on this shirt though is that the hem is slightly twisted you can just see that it's sort of lumpy and twisted now one thing that i wanted to look at is what was happening under the arm and i definitely do feel like there is some extra fabric here almost it's like striping down right here now packed in particular does fit larger than the other brands so it is a bit looser and that could also be why we're getting a bit of extra fabric under the armpit here the shoulders on this one actually are sitting on my shoulder point which is pretty uncommon for me so if you do have broader shoulders this could be a good brand for you but if you have narrow shoulders they might be too wide now twice so far i've had to flip down the seam on the sleeve and that has to do with the fact that it is such a narrow fold okay so then we have the cotton one and there is a noticeable fit difference between this one and the one before this one is definitely a lot more fitted i feel it pretty snugly across my body and because this is a much thicker and more dense knit it doesn't have that same looseness and stretch as those lighter knits do so to me this is a very different t-shirt this is a much more structured almost more like formal t-shirt if that makes any sense the shoulders are a little narrow for me i would not want to size down in this one and actually if i wanted a looser t-shirt i might even size up the shaping on the side seam is really nice it is fairly snug in the hips but because it's a denser fabric i mean it's more snug all over so this is definitely if you wanted a more structured and fitted shirt so now we have the armed angels tee and we're back to a lighter knit but this is a more fitted t-shirt than the first two that we tried on something very interesting to note is that when i felt these different t-shirts with my hand this one felt a bit stiffer but on it actually feels really soft so the other ones i think are spun with a bit fluffier yarn so at first hand it does feel like fluffier and softer whereas this one seems to have a tighter sponge fiber so even though it initially feels a bit stiffer it actually is quite like silky feeling almost on so i quite like the feeling of this and i'm pleasantly surprised by how soft it feels and that just goes to show that you can't necessarily judge things just by touching them with your hands you do have to try it on unlike some of the other ones where the shoulders were quite a ways in this to me is at a good point and when i was working as a fit model because my shoulders were a bit more broad this is where they would fit the shoulder points to so this is where the shoulders sit from most narrow to widest and so this one also looked like it had a bit of extra fabric under the arm but the packed one was larger so i think that's why we got that kind of draping and pulling this one actually fits really nicely i think along the armpits under the arm i don't at all feel like there's too much fabric there and the sleeves feel really comfortable the thing that i wanted to check is whether this was uncomfortable at all or looking weird or anything because it wasn't top stitched down that's something that i'm going to make note of as i wear it a few times and as i wear it longer but right now i don't think it's a problem at all so i really like this one as a t-shirt i think it feels really nice it fits well i don't really have any complaints about it okay so now we have the organic basics shirt and this one is unfortunately harder to see because it is black so you can't see the details as well this one is the longest one it hits me right here i'm petite i'm only 5'3 so for me that's a little bit longer than i would want my t-shirt but it's also pretty easy to hem this is the only one that has spandex in it so that is gonna affect the fit and comfort and i definitely noticed just in terms of being able to move around like there is absolutely nothing restricting my movement in any way i know people have different preferences for straight or fitted t-shirts i think the fitted shirts look a bit nicer if you're tucking them in really tight but i also run into the issue which will see if that happens as we're wearing it that the fitted shirts tend to kind of like bunch up around the waist whereas straight shirts don't have that issue and i also prefer the way they look if you tuck them in loosely so yeah just a personal preference but i do tend to like a straighter cut shirt again i don't really have any fit issues or complaints the fabric is really nice and soft and i think everything looks really good here are the shirts side by side to see the fit differences so then i wore and washed each t-shirt at least three times the cotton and packed shirts i enjoyed wearing the least the packed shirt because the hems really bothered me and just don't look very good and the cotton shirt because i prefer looser and drapier shirts so this kind of style just felt a bit heavy and restrictive and they do actually have lighter shirts which i probably should have gotten but at the time i ordered these it was going into winter so i think they were featuring their heavier shirts so i am interested to try some of their other shirts but if you are a person who likes thicker denser and more fitted tees then i do think this is a great t-shirt it's just not the style that i usually like while the everlane shirt was soft and comfortable to wear i didn't like the fabric and that it was so thin and sheer and i had to be careful of what color undergarments i had underneath the armed angel shirt was also really comfortable to wear but the little bit of neckline surging did flip up which i was worried about and it bothered me a bit i don't know why that isn't just stitched down it's just a small thing but compared to the other ones it was noticeable and finally the organic basics tee i liked the best there was really nothing to complain about it was soft and comfortable and really stretchy and easy to move in so now let's compare their environmental and ethical practices and this is all based on what they say publicly so things that we as customers could easily find on their websites for the material packed organic basics and armed angels all use got certified organic cotton which is a great certification cotton and everlane do not use organic cotton however cotton has direct trade practices and they work with cotton farmers in egypt so they have a lot of traceability and transparency around their cotton and they also say that they are working directly with the farmers to improve their systems and get organic certification everlane says that they are moving to organic cotton by 2023 so still a few years from now however i have noticed that they are incorporating some organic cotton into their collection they didn't have it when i ordered this t-shirt but it looks like they do have an organic cotton t-shirt now it's also important to note that the organic basics tee has some spandex in it which is a negative for sustainability in that it's synthetic however spandex also greatly improves the retention so it won't stretch out and lose its shape as fast which is a positive for longevity and sustainability and i have a video that goes way more into spandex and sustainable fashion and why it's often a necessary evil so i will link that if you haven't watched it yet it digs all into that in terms of other areas of sustainability organic basics and armed angels in particular have lots of great information about different things they're doing to reduce their impact like addressing water and chemical use and lowering waste and energy cotton has some good info about what they're doing with water and dyeing and organic basics and packed both carbon offset their shipping pact and everlane really don't have much information about other sustainability initiatives and the ones that everlane does share all have to do with their office or their stores and not really the manufacturing of the garments so overall for sustainability organic basics and armed angels definitely seem to be doing the most now let's look at the brand's ethics so the god certification which i already mentioned does include some social aspects armed angels has fair trade certification and pact is fair trade certification for some but not all their products and they say this is because the products which aren't certified are manufactured in countries where there already is strict wage and labor laws while the fair trade certification is great i do wish that pact provided a bit more specific information about their factories organic basics manufacturers in europe and they are really transparent about their factories they even have information like how many hours a week the employees work and how many vacation days they get and the factories have a variety of sustainability and ethical certifications cotton also has really good transparency around their factories and supply chain but not many certifications everlane also has good transparency about their factories but no certifications that i could find and they also don't seem to really include information about wages or social programs both organic basics and cotton are certified b corps and if you want to learn more about what that means i have a video about that and organic basics and armed angels also both have pita vegan approved products it's also worth noting that cotton does a lot of work building schools and improving literacy in egypt in the communities where they farm and manufacture in so overall for ethics obviously fair trade certification is great because it's a third party that comes in and audits but i also think organic basics has some really good transparency around their manufacturing and i think cotton is doing some really interesting things with their kind of farm to closet approach it's not a business model that we see a lot again everlane is on the bottom for me because even though they disclose information about their factories they really don't say much about the ethical treatment of workers they say that they aim for a 90 score on their internal audit but we really have no idea if factories actually get that score or how close to that score they are and this is probably a good time to chat a bit more about everlane because it's been a bit of a roller coaster i've never recommended everlane initially it was because they weren't really doing anything in terms of sustainability and their radical transparency just was never very transparent however over the last few years they've been doing a lot more with sustainable materials and some people who i really admire and respect in the ethical fashion space seem to love them so i thought maybe i was being too harsh and that i should give them a shot and when i decided to make this video i thought that would be a perfect opportunity now i ordered these t-shirts last year in the fall it's taken me a long time to get this video out but when i ordered them i was approaching everlane with an open mind and then shortly after i got the shirt information came out that everlane had been union busting which is incredibly unethical and then later on more allegations came out about them just having a very toxic and racist work environment so just when i was trying to give everlane a shot it turns out that they're actually not a very ethical company and in short i would not recommend everlane i don't think they're a good brand their radical transparency is ridiculous and just seems like a marketing gimmick and it's not just their ethics and transparency their sustainability and quality is also lacking so now let's get into my final thoughts and if these brands are worth their prices i think it's pretty obvious that everlane is at the bottom while the price point is the most accessible the quality isn't particularly good they don't have a lot of information available and they're just doing some shady stuff based on just this t-shirt i also wouldn't recommend packed the construction quality really isn't very good and they don't have a lot of information available but they do have the gots and fair trade certifications to back them up however like i said i have had some really good quality packed stuff so i guess if you are interested just know that it might be a bit of a gamble try your best to research the quality of the garment and know that you might have to return things for a lower price point option i would definitely recommend cotton this shirt is only five dollars more than the everlane shirt the sewing and fabric is really nice quality and even though it's not organic i do really like what they're doing in terms of being fully involved in their supply chain and manufacturing if you really care about sustainability then organic basics and armed angels are both great organic options they're soft and comfortable the fit is good the quality is good and both these brands are doing a lot of things to reduce their impact armed angels is very expensive to ship to north america though so keep that in mind if you are looking at price however it's a great option for those of you in europe organic basics is also based in europe however they do have distributors in the us and canada which i can link as well so i guess now a big question is is the organic basics tea actually worth almost 40 us dollars and almost twice the everlane tea honestly if you're able to spend that you will get a really soft comfortable good quality t-shirt it's really wearable and i think is going to be a staple in my wardrobe plus as a brand they have a really great mission and practices which i think are worth supporting one of my only issues with this t-shirt is just the lack of colors because it only comes in white and black but i also get that not everyone can drop forty dollars on a t-shirt and actually in canadian dollars i ended up spending fifty dollars on this t-shirt but after comparing it with the other shirts i do feel better about the price however if it's too much for you then i think cotton is at a great price point for what you get and if all these prices are inaccessible for you then definitely check out my videos on building a sustainable and ethical wardrobe on a budget i will link those down below because slow fashion is expensive but there are lots of different ways that you can have a more conscious closet for all different budgets so after all of this organic basics armed angels and cotton would be my top picks depending on what kind of t-shirt you're looking for so this was definitely the longest and most work i've ever put into a video so please please give this a thumbs up if you liked this and found it helpful also i would love to hear your feedback in the comments so would you like to see more of this kind of video with different products and brands and also what aspects of the review were most helpful for you and any other feedback you have like was this too long i know i personally really like lots of details and information but maybe it's too much for most people so let me know this is my first time making this style of video so i just really love to hear what you think of it thank you for watching and an extra special thank you to those of you supporting me on patreon i would not be able to do videos like this without that extra support it's definitely expensive ordering a bunch of sustainable t-shirts and putting this much work into a video so i really really appreciate it and i will see you guys in the next one [Music]", "TyoU3mKwd6g": "over the last three months I only wore three shirts this one from Patagonia that I bought for $50 this one from ever lane that I bought for 30 and this one that I bought from Walmart for a whopping $6 in this video we're gonna figure out whether or not they're worth the money that I bought them for hey team welcome back to another Levi's save the world Hildebrand episode the channel where we prove that you don't need to be a hero to save the planet today I'm going to be comparing a Patagonia ever lain and Jorge t-shirt to see if the price that you pay for a t-shirt actually impacts the quality of the product itself this video is a part of a series where I do challenges and experiments to test out sustainability practices in real life I boycotted Black Friday and Cyber Monday I only ate uber eats for two entire weeks and most recently I documented my experience living without a car in North America for an entire year this video like all of those other videos is brought to you by my patreon supporters on patreon I post exclusive behind-the-scenes updates on these challenge videos and everything else that I'm working on in addition to that you get to see a secret podcast that I release every single month where I talk about sustainability stories in the news and my own personal journey here on this channel trying to reduce my environmental impact so if you're interested in any of that or you just want to support this channel head down to the description to check it out for yourself but here in this video we are going to be breaking down my experience only wearing three shirts for 90 days every single day for 90 days straight so right off the top I have to acknowledge that this is not a mathematical experiment in any sort of way but I did take some measures to try and keep this as fair as possible all of the shirts that I'm comparing are made of a hundred percent cotton they were all made outside of North America and all of these shirts were worn and washed the exact same number of times see I even kept this tally my phone I wore them all in pretty similar conditions from riding my bike around town working out to working all day sitting at a computer I watched them in full loads of laundry and dried them in an open-air drying rack upstairs but one quick note about washing probably a whole bunch of you just thought to yourselves wait 30 wears and 5 washes that means Levi's Wars shirt like 9 times without washing it and I would say that you're wrong because 30 divided by 5 is 6 but the point is yeah I don't wash my clothes very often because you really don't have to in fact I bought that pair of jeans right there 4 months ago and I still haven't watched them yet [Laughter] Leah you love this stuff way too much the reality is washing your clothes is one of the fastest ways to wear them out these three t-shirts would have been in way worse condition if I was washing them with warm water and drying them in a drying machine rant summary you probably don't need to be washing your clothes as often as you are save the planet your wallet and your clothes by just washing with cold water and air drying but anyways let's go s see what happened for the final evaluation of these shirts I based it off of three very random criteria that I invented for the purpose of this video number one is fit does this shirt actually fit me the way that I wanted it to when I bought it in the first place and does it look bad generally number two is wear and tear does the fabric itself seem to have broken down at all as appealing as it stretched out etc and number three is cost does it seem to be worth the money that I spent on the shirt after 30 days of using it well let's start with the most expensive so full disclosure for the sake of this video I love Patagonia I think that they're an incredible company I made a whole video about them and what they do in a video a couple years back when I look like I actually worked for them I'm probably not going to grow my hair it again if that's a word for some people so don't unsubscribe just based on that alone the fit of this shirt has honestly been one of my favorites of the three begin with I know that this is very different and very subjective because every shirt fits every person differently but this cut just seems to really work for my body type wear and tear this shirt has held up extremely well once you get a really nice close-up on the fabric itself you can see that it has been used but the material has retained its shape and retained its fabric integrity really really well for the most part this shirt looks pretty well the same as when I got it 30 warez ago now in terms of cost for me the Patagonia was a very expensive shirt fifty dollars for a t-shirt that's just cotton in today's world seems crazy because that's often ten times the price of what you can get a similar looking gray t-shirt for but this has held up extremely well for that dollar value part of the reason why this shirt is so expensive is because Patagonia is a leader in socially an environmentally responsible fashion but we're gonna get into that later in the video let's move on to ever lane now full disclosure I made a video debunking ever lanes claims to be radically transparent but they are a higher-end brand and therefore they should in theory have a higher quality product fit and feel honestly I love the fit of this shirt as well it's been always quite nice and tight and slimming the only thing that's slightly different from the Patagonia is the fact that it feels like a lighter shirt the material seems to be I don't know how else to put it a lighter it feels like there's less shirt on me right now and that's not necessarily a bad thing but it does feel slightly cheaper wear and tear because it does feel like a slightly lighter material it does have a bit more wear and tear to it you can see some of the fabric coming away at some of the seams but really not that much considering that I've worn it thirty different times number three cost now for 30 bucks I would say that this is a good value shirt it looks good after 30 different wares and it costs less than the Patagonia it doesn't feel like quite the same quality of a shirt but overall I think it's a good value now speaking of value let's see what we get out of a six dollar shirt how is it even possible to design produce manufacture and distribute a shirt for six dollars it honestly baffles me but the outcome is pretty predictable fit and feel this shirt never fit me as well as the first two shirts did but you can obviously see that it's just a bag your shirt maybe this is to appeal to more people but it's clear that over time the shirt has just lost some of its shape now this shirt isn't ripped or destroyed in any way or dirty but I am not very excited to wear this shirt because of the condition that it's in after only 30 wears and honestly this shirt was starting to look used after about 20 wares or so wear and tear even without looking too closely you can tell that this shirt is old it's been worn and you can obviously see that all over the shirt even without looking too closely you can see that there's peeling happening throughout the shirt not just on high rubbing areas there also seems to be some weird discoloration going on around the collar number three cost now for six dollars it's hard to say whether or not it's worth it because it costs less than a burger at McDonalds I mean I guess with that in consideration the fact that it lasted even half as long as the others is impressive but like I said at the beginning how does a shirt like this even exist for $6 farmers had to grow crops materials had to be processed designs had to be created final products shipped delivered marketed and then sold to you for $6 now this is really where price starts to come into play because these shirts not only reflect the quality of the products themselves but the values that the companies that made them try to uphold except for like dolce gabbana and supreme and all that other crap you're literally just paying for the brand name in those cases so I realized while I was editing this video that you can really tell the differences between these shirts super well so I thought I would add in another test to illustrate the differences between these shirts that no one could possibly deny a blindfold taste test well no not at eight like a feel a field test you're gonna get blindfolded now okay go upstairs good there's the stairs wow you're really good at walking blindfolded holy smokes god I wish there was a cooler surprise then here's the first one okay second one okay okay yes here's the stretch test some give the bottom doesn't feel very nice though this feels kind of Pilli it doesn't have as much give still stretchy this one has more stretch than the last one but I don't know if it has as much stretch this one's the most stretchy this is the gorge one this is ever lame this is Patagonia no how did you do that they feel different this one feels kind of chilly in a bit rough okay this one feels this one almost feels a bit like creamier butter people know what I mean and this one's like an in-between I got a right though yeah that's really good those awesome I found that super interesting because without being able to see what she was touching Leah somehow managed to pick them all right I mean I'm not staging this I definitely could have but it didn't somehow she picked exactly the right ones based on yeah can I wear it yeah sure if you want alrights mine now so what's the difference between a 50 a 30 and a $6 t-shirt the companies that created them I chose these three companies very specifically for this challenge because they represent the spread of fashion options available to most consumers we have Patagonia which is a known social and environmental advocate ever Lane which has marketed themselves as an environmentally responsible company but they're not and Gorge that basically couldn't give a about the state of the earth now I've got to be really honest I was super nervous about this challenge because I was mortified that my fifty dollar Patagonia t-shirt was going to be basically the same as a six dollar equivalent unfortunately that's not the case now as you know I'm probably biased I think the Patagonia is an outstanding company because there are very few companies of its size in the fashion industry that have done as much as they have for the sake of people and the planet but right now we're going to talk about this shirt specifically it is the only one out of the three that uses fair trade sewing practices that means that the people who made this shirt likely made a fair wage for the country that they live in they're also the only one that makes all of their t-shirts out of organic cotton a material that is far better for the planet but this shirt is also a Patagonia t-shirt and I bought it three years ago and it's still in pretty awesome condition ever lain actually makes a pretty good t-shirt which I was resentfully happy to see unfortunately their claims of radical transparency greatly mislead a lot of people into thinking that they're more sustainable than they are instead of third party certification through Fairtrade sewing they simply link you to the place where your garment was made but unfortunately none of this can be confirmed because unlike Patagonia they are not a register B corporation but this is not a takedown video about ever Lane I already made that video but all in all I would say that you're paying in part for a slightly higher quality product but also for the idea that you're supporting an ethical clothing company I really wanted to like ever Lane and finally George the crown jewel of the fast fashion industry imagine all of the horror stories that you've heard about fast fashion and that's this puppy right here unfortunately this has become normal unfortunately we kind of proved that you get what you pay for a $6 shirt doesn't last very long so obviously I would love for us all to just buy those really expensive Patagonia shirts because they are the ones that are making a fashion model that works for us and the planet but I understand that not everybody can spring for a $50 t-shirt personally I own a number of Patagonia shirts but I bought them over a period of time I purchased them when I had the means to and when I could find them on sale the beauty of Patagonia and higher quality brands is that if you can find them used they're probably still going to be in very good condition for exactly the reasons that we just outlined here today but the best option is always to find secondhand clothing if you can and support the environmentally focused companies that are out there if that isn't available but I want to thank you for watching this video I don't want to hear your feedback I'm going to be making more videos where I do experiments and challenges to test different environmental practices and so if you have any suggestions please leave them down in the comments below and of

buy because there's so many different brands out there there's so much different quality out there and finding good quality basic street wear shirts and obviously sometimes pretty different personally I love to avoid all the cheap kind of brands out there and I like to buy a little bit more premium quality when it comes to stuff like shirts so today's video I want to talk about one of the new brands I've found in terms of basic clothing and that is reporter and today we're gonna be talking about all about reporter t-shirts up without saying too much more let's get into it what's up guys if you're new here my name is Matt I make a ton of videos like this on YouTube twice a week usually if you're new here I suggest subscribing them below it is definitely a growing community and I appreciate all the support I get in every video so let's talk about reporter who is reporter well reporter is a wholesale like dirt hoodie sweatshirt sweat pant company and they really try to capitalize on people who are looking for very basic clothing but a more premium quality so today we're gonna talk to my t-shirt I picked up three of them in my left hand which would be on your right side was gonna be a black I'm currently wearing their vintage wash shirt and on my right your left will be the white t-shirt so something interesting to note about with all these shirts is that they're all made in Portugal there's different levels of cotton that they use all three of the ones I'm wearing right now are more of their like ultra luxury ones which in my opinion are just heavier t-shirts I actually did order two white ones that were supposed to be one in the regular original version and one of the luxury cotton version but they ran out of the white one in my size and the reason why I wanted two of those is really because of how I've been wearing my shirts and stuff lately is I've been wearing stuff like this under like a sweatshirt or something that's what kind of piece of the bottom and picks out a little bit at the top but honestly the guys over at reporters or customer service can reach out to me and actually texted me saying hey like we'll give you an upgrade to the ultra version because it ran out and in my opinion I need to mention that because you don't get that all the time and most people would have just canceled the order they wouldn't even let you know they would just strip just cancel if you get one shirt and be curious on why so for them to reach out honestly I thought was worth mentioning it lets me know what the customer service team cares lets me know the Britain cares about the customer more than it cares about like three dollars in profit and I'm hoping that I can help them of the three dollars of loss and profit for me can go ahead and go back into other people buying their stuff and know this isn't a sponsor post didn't get any of these products to free I just got like the ultra version of this one at a slightly discounted rate but not on purpose so getting it to the actual quality of the shirt some stuff I'm talking about everything else but the shirt quality honestly these are extremely good quality shirts they're very thick they feel way better than gilding they feel way better than American Apparel in my opinion iOS a that they feel better than some of the LA apparel they're better than pretty much any other quality shirt that's like a wholesale division that I felt personally I'd say these are closer to what you will find in an essentials t-shirt than what you will find with the minimal ones and even I'm going on record and saying I actually love the quality of this so much better than the essentials teachers and I think the main differences between these reporter shirts and essentials are kind of twofold one is that these have virtually no branding on these like literally is no branding because you're supposed to put your own branding on this is supposed to be for like a brand to buy but if you look there's literally no tag here at all it's just my size tag which I about these all and a medium i think the other difference between this and an essentials teacher would be that the neck collar is a little bit higher up it is more like kind of reaching more mock neck territory when it comes to kind of how its spinning this is the only thing that i don't really care for on this i wish it was a little bit lower because like my collarbone is down here and it is like way up here you can probably even see that i have like a tan this is where I normally have my t-shirts and it's a lot higher than that something to keep in mind for for summer because if you can have a tan you really don't want this a shirt on at that point cousin you have a tan up here and any heavy either tan down here something to keep in mind now in terms of sizing I went down the size I normally wear a large and all my shirts it's my true to size size I went down to medium just based off their size guide fact I didn't really want arm links that went down past my elbow and for me these fit perfectly how I wanted it to I didn't want super oversize but I did want it more of a drop shoulder relaxed fit and for me personally this fits the cut and with sizing on this for me personally I went down size you can go true to size and I've definitely seen it work the guy that really pushed my hand to buying this was on the Facebook group so looked at someone honey I think is like Luciano and hopefully I'll have like some type of photo up of his Instagram page but he was really the person I saw and he went true to size with his shirts I went down a size and I personally feel like that fits better for how I like my clothing and not looking super duper big and stuff but just looking just right for me I honestly think with this vintage wash I think that could have been a little bit better of a wash with it pairing it to this locusts and wild honey t-shirt that I bought from Paul funny fella when he dropped it this is a vintage watch shirt through and through a little bit softer feel to it I would say that the wash on the t-shirt is night and day you can pretty much see the difference like this is more like a wash black this is in my opinion a vintage wash but then again this could wash down where the wall I haven't put these in the washing machine yet although I do plan on putting this one in the washing machine soon sure suit I can't frickin talk today and just kind of see how that turns out be really interesting to see if I can turn it more into this vintage style look that's kind of why I bought it rather than just like kind of washed black we're just gonna looks like a dark grey in a way I think the only improvements that could be made to this shirt to make it perfect for me personally so just definitely differs from person to person I'll be lowering the neck a little bit probably like an inch down it'd be a little bit more of a normal like look to it but still being able to peek out a little bit under like a sweatshirt or things like that and for me I don't really care for super long what's called sleeves on stuff I like a little bit shorter so having it like in the middle of where your arm and meet with still drop shoulder I think would look really good but being in the minority there but just something that personal preference for all this everybody has their own preferences from me something like that I think it would be my everyday wear for t-shirts I do plan on checking out their hoodies and sweatpants once we drop more the vintage II wash stuff and I'll be giving my thoughts on them in a video once that comes along but overall from what I've seen in the Facebook group with other people talking definitely worth the money you definitely have racer prices a little bit to be very worried about that if you're looking for best quality street wear blanks that you can basically buy a better quality t-shirt for pretty low prices made in Portugal using very high quality Cotton's I would say that reporter is our best bet and I would say they are someone that you should starting to buy from and if all else fails you spend $25 that $30 on a t-shirt and if you don't like you don't like it I guarantee you you spent more on t-shirts that don't fit you well and if all spills can wear it to that there's no branding on them I don't really know it's ink go buy one for yourself I'll leave a link to them down in the description below and well if you want to start a brand with these go ahead you're probably the best feeling t-shirts on the market for like branding with your own screen print on them and that has been today's video about reporter let me know you gets to give them in the comments below if you have any thoughts or different opinions leave them below I would love to hear them and I think would help other people with their purchases and if you want to I would suggest subscribing below really helps out a small youtube channel like myself and worry I'll leave a like on the video to let me know that you guys liked it and want to see more videos like this on my channel and again with all this craziness going around and me being stuck at home for days upon days you just want to say thank you guys so much for watching this video and have a great rest of your day week month and I'll see you in the next video peace", "hFI-HB2bHDs": "what's up guys guillermo here again with another episode of print pros if you're familiar with director garmin printing then you've probably heard that some dtg printers and inks will not print polyester garments well but what if i told you you can actually print high quality photorealistic images on polyester using a dtg printer to show you how it's done i'm going to be using the image armor pre-treatment solution and the wagner spray bottle to pre-treat garments this step is crucial in producing a stunning print on polyester fabrics so make sure to take notes because your final product does depend on this crucial step both the printer and the pre-treatment supplies i'll be using can be purchased as a complete package on our website so i'll make sure to link that down in the description all right that's enough talking let's go ahead and start printing [Music] all right so let's go over what we're going to be using to print on these polyester shirts now obviously first up we have the stars of the show which are these two polyester shirts now i have a black one and a white one since i'm going to be showing you how to print on both and then here we have the all-important pre-treatment solution now as you can see i have two different bottles since we're going to be printing on two different shirts white and black now obviously the image armor ultra is going to be for our black shirt and the image armor light formula is going to be for our white shirt now both of these are available on our online store so if you're interested in ordering this today go down to the link in the description then to do our pre-treatment we have our spray gun now you can buy these in any home improvement store like lowe's or home depot but it is also included with your dtg printer when you buy it through our store in the bundle now like i mentioned earlier for our dtg printer we're going to be using the ricoh ri1000 link in the description and then for our heat press we're going to be using one sheet of teflon and this is going to be 16 by 20 inches speaking of the heat press today we're going to be using the ricoma hp 16 by 20. the 16 by 20 stands for the surface area of the heat press which is 16 by 20 inches hence the 16 by 20 inch piece of teflon all right guys so let's go over how much you can be making by selling shirts like these now first up we bought these shirts online on wholesale for about four dollars per shirt then we have to take into account the cost of the pre-treatment solution and our ink which is a matter of sensing between the two of them so let's just say it's about a dollar to be generous and that brings the overall cost of each shirt to about five dollars now you can sell these shirts online for about 20 to 25 and that gives you a final profit per shirt of between 15 to 20 all right so let's go ahead and start our pre-treatment process i'm going to be starting off with the black shirt and then i'm going to be doing the white shirt now i'm going to be doing them both separately because i do have to change out the pre-treatment solution in my spray gun now this spray gun if i didn't mention it before we got this one at i think it was home depot or lowe's and we got it for around 80 but again it is included with your dtg in the bundle at the time of purchase now for the black shirt i'm going to be using the image armor ultra for black or dark t-shirts again we do sell this at our store if you guys are interested so to do the pre-treatment on this chair what i'm basically just going to do is that i'm going to take my spray gun i'm going to put it on the lowest setting when it comes to output to do that all i have to do is twist this knob out as far out as it'll go and then just do my best to maybe squeeze the trigger as lightly as i can essentially what we're trying to do is just create a very light mist that just covers all areas of the t-shirt or the area that we're planning on printing on so what i'm going to do is i'm going to take my spray gun and i'm going to spray from bottom to the top top to bottom like this and then take it again and do it horizontally as well now when i'm spraying the shirt what i'm trying to do is stay about a foot away from it the goal is just to create a light layer of pre-treat on the top surface of the shirt you don't want to completely soak it and then after this we're going to go ahead and take our shirt to the heat press to cure the pre-treat onto the t-shirt all right so let's press the shirt to cure the pre-treat like i mentioned earlier we're going to be using the ricoma hp 1620 to do this i'm going to pull out the tray it's a very cool feature because this way i don't have to work under the hot element of the press burning my hands and all that i'm gonna place my t-shirt on the tray try to get it all straightened out now there are certain areas of the shirt that i did get pre-treated on that i am not pressing but that doesn't really matter since i'm not gonna be printing on those areas and those areas are the bottom of the shirt and the sleeves for example now i'm going to be pressing this shirt for 60 seconds at 285 degrees fahrenheit now in the instructions for this pre-treat in the back it states that you should press your shirt to cure it for 30 seconds at 330 degrees fahrenheit now because of the fact that i am doing a polyester shirt i don't want to be pressing my shirt at that temperature so i'm going to lower it down to 285 degrees fahrenheit instead of 330. and then it stays to press it for 30 seconds and then if you still see any steam or moisture on top of your shirt to press it for an additional 10 seconds and then do that over and over again until you don't see any steam or moisture now i've already done this in the past and i found that pressing it for 60 seconds eliminates all my moisture and steam in one go all right so then i'm gonna place a sheet of teflon over my shirt to protect it insert it into the heat press and then i'm going to press it all right 60 seconds 285 degrees fahrenheit all right when the heat press is done it's going to automatically open i'm going to take out my shirt remove the teflon and i'm just going to feel the top of the shirt and yep it's nice and dry we can go ahead and print on this take my shirt off and let's go ahead and do the white one now all right so let's go ahead and pre-treat our white shirt now now for this we are going to be using a different pre-treat we're going to be using the image armor light formula this is what you want to use for your white shirts your very light colored shirts when you're doing either polyester or cotton this means that i have to change out the pre-treatment formula that i have on my spray gun and to do that what you want to do is you want to make sure to take this off dump out any of the old formula that you have in since you don't want to be mixing the light formula and the ultra formula together you want to dump that out then rinse out this container put some water in it close it back up and do a few sprays with just water inside of the container what this is going to do is that it's going to flush out the spray gun of any of the old pre-treatment formula that you were using for the black shirts now i already did this so i'm just going to go ahead and fill up this container with the light pre-treatment formula now before you use this make sure to give it a good shake [Music] all right and now we're ready to do our white shirt and the process is basically the same now because of the fact that this is a white shirt versus a black shirt you might actually have to put less pre-treat but if you notice that on your black shirts your print is not coming out as good as you would want it it might be because you have to put more pretreat on a black shirt versus a white [Music] shirt [Music] and we're ready to go back over to the heat press all right so this part of the process is pretty much identical just going to take out the tray load up our white t-shirt cover it with a sheet of teflon and again we're gonna be pressing it for 60 seconds at 285 degrees fahrenheit at light pressure let's take it over to our dtg okay so here we are at our dtg printer again this is the ricoh ri-1000 if you guys want to learn more about it go down to the link in the description all right so first up what i'm gonna do is that i'm gonna take my black shirt and unlike what i did in our previous episode when i printed on the cotton shirt which you can watch by going down to the link in the description i'm not going to just place my polyester shirt right on top of the platen just like that what i'm actually going to do is that i'm going to thread the platen and i'll explain why i'm going to thread the platen by opening up my t-shirt and just pulling it through the collar is going to be facing this way or towards me and then make sure all the leftover fabric is inside the carriage now the reason why i threaded the shirt instead of just placing it on top is because of the fact that polyester is a moisture wicking fabric some of that ink is going to go right through the first layer of fabric of my t-shirt and it's going to land on the second layer of my t-shirt and i don't really want that i don't want any ink on the back of my t-shirt so what i'm going to do is thread the platen so that the ink goes through the first layer and then onto the actual plan of the dtg and then i'll just clean that off after every print all right then i just take my bracket and i place it over the t-shirt so that it stays nice and secure and flat okay now let's go over to our software so that we can send over the design to print all right so here we are on our printing software which does come included with your printer so all i have to do is drag over my design and there you have it polyester is a moisture wicking fabric now what this means is that it does not retain as much moisture as cotton does this is the reason why we like polyester since they're usually used for workout clothing or sports uniforms because of the fact that they keep us nice and dry and cool but this also means that it does not take our ink very well from our dtg printer so what we have to do is that we have to add more ink than we usually do with our cotton shirts so what we're gonna do to get more ink onto our polyester shirt when printing this design is that for the black shirt what we're actually going to do is do a double white layer underneath before we do our colored layer and then when we do our color there we're going to try to get as much ink as possible onto it by bumping up our contrast and our saturation now for our white shirt all we have to do is bump up our contrast and our saturation as high as we can i'm gonna go into our project and i'm gonna start making my way through these tabs now since i'm just going to print the design dead in the center i'm not really going to adjust my size or the position of the design on the garment and i'm going to just go to color and in color i'm going to choose my media which is going to be a black garment now in this specific software you choose this not just for black shirts but you would also choose this for dark colored garments like reds or blues and then i'm going to go to settings now here's where i'm going to make the adjustments to my colors to try to get as much ink as i possibly can onto that t-shirt so for contrast i'm going to bump it up to 100 and then i'm going to go to profiles and set my saturation enhancement to high i'm going to press ok and then i'm going to go to rip and i'm going to check off use document transparency what this is going to do is that it's going to make the software respect the transparency that i built into my design then i'm going to press ok and as you can see there is now a black square around my design meaning that the software is now using the transparency of the design and the black is the black of the t-shirt now all we have to do is press print and it's going to send it over okay so here we have our design we already sent it over using our network it appeared right here and we're pretty much set to go i'm gonna just press set and the machine is gonna do its [Music] thing [Music] [Music] all right so here we have our finished black shirt now we're not completely done with this we still have to take this over to the heat press to press it one more time to make sure to cure the ink but before we do that i'm gonna show you guys what i meant earlier about threading the shirt and why you have to do it so i'm going to take off the bracket remove my shirt carefully make sure that it doesn't get folded or wrinkled or stuck to anything as you see right here there's a little bit of resistance as i remove the shirt because it is a little bit stuck to the platen since we are printing on polyester some of the ink went right through the shirt and onto the platen but that's not a big deal we can easily clean that in between print jobs and that's why take a little bit of either windex or any type of all-purpose cleaner spray it on there i do recommend that you do this immediately after every single print that way you don't allow for any time for that ink to set in onto your platen and ruin it and then we just wipe it off with either an old t-shirt a rag paper towels anything that you might have on hand and that's pretty much it all right so let's go over to our heat press now i'm gonna take out the tray again all right then i'm gonna bring in my shirt place it on my heat press make sure it's nice and flat i'm gonna place a sheet of teflon over it and we're gonna put it in now this time i'm gonna be pressing it for 285 degrees fahrenheit again but for 90 seconds change my timer to 90 seconds here we go [Music] i'm gonna bring it out and there we have our finisher okay so that's how you dtg on a black polyester shirt now let's go over and do it on the white shirt the process is pretty much the same with a few little differences all right so now we're back at our software and we're going to print on our white shirt so let's just make a few different adjustments here we're going to go back into our settings for our design and we're going to go to color instead of choosing black garment we're going to choose white garment we're going to choose settings and then here we are going to still do high saturation and then in the contrast in the color correction section we're gonna do 65 contrast instead now because of the fact that this is a white shirt we don't need as much ink as we needed for our black shirt but we still need more ink than we do for our regular white cotton shirts remember polyester is a moisture wicking material i'm going to press ok and press ok again and we're going to press control print and go over to our printer all right so here we are back out our dtg printer i'm gonna go ahead and load up our white shirt the same way i did our black one i'm gonna go ahead and place my bracket over that again i'm just going to press set and it's going to go right in [Music] all right so that's it for printing on the white shirt let's go ahead and heat press it all right so we're going to throw on our shirt onto the heat press now for the white shirt we're actually going to press it at 285 degrees again but for 40 seconds since it is a white shirt we don't need to press it as long as the black one so i'm going to change my timer to 40 seconds i'm gonna cover it with a sheet of teflon put it in there we go all right there we go we'll pull it out remove the teflon sheet and there we have our finished print all right guys that's it for this episode i hope this video helped you see that it's possible to print on polyester with a dtg printer the key takeaway here is that you have to pre-treat your garment if you want your prints to come out looking

watching and i'll see you next week on the next episode of primrose you", "DfLcKsflR2o": "[Music] okay so my daughter starts school next week and recently we went to pick up her gym uniform and the shorts that they gave us had this white bar across the leg where a name would normally go so her name would normally go here if you wanted it they charge extra flat but all they had were assurance with this white bar so they wanted to give us these shorts for free because we didn't want him like that but I paid for him anyway it was a big deal but I said that I could just put her name on here with my vinyl cutter so today we're gonna be using the Cricut explore air to to cut out some vinyl and put her name on her gym uniform should be long so let's turn on this heat press awhile [Music] so I have it set to 350 degrees that's for a screen printing I'm gonna put this down to maybe 250 degrees or the vinyl [Music] so 250 degrees because we're working with this type of material so this is 100% polyester and we don't want to burn the shorts so 250 degrees should be good our guys so I'm gonna go over to my desk where my Cricut explore air tube is at and we're gonna cut some vinyl [Music] all right so I'm gonna do a quick screen grab for design space design space and I'm gonna click on the text tab and write my daughter's first name well her nickname and I'm gonna do a second version of her first letter of her name and her last name then I'm gonna put the width so 4 inches and a height of 1 inch and as you can see I changed there but we'll fix that the same thing for that other version and this part I forget that the lock box is not unlocked so it's not doing what I wanted to do so I unlock it and I put four inches as a width and one inch as a height so I do the same thing for her first name and that lock box unlocked and I'm gonna put 4 inches as a width and a height of 1 inch and I'm gonna click make it alright so I'm gonna rearrange just the way I want it cut so I'm just gonna put them on top of each other and click there and as you can see here the the the top one mirrored but the first name on the bottom did not mirror I didn't notice that but it came out alright I don't know what happened there maybe a glitch [Music] all right we have our vinyl cut so let's see how it looks on the shorts perfect okay so I'm gonna change the pressure of the heat press because I had it at a really really light pressure for the screen printing but we're doing vinyl so I'm gonna put the pressure and back down [Music] [Music] all right guys check these out they came

color orange it's a four and a half ounce t-shirt so it's a lighter weight and it's a little bit softer filled being that it's a ring spun cotton it's contoured for a ladies fit so you can see that it's a little bit slimmer in the sides it does have a side seam the anvil 880 features a tearaway label it comes in all 14 of our warehouses and it goes in sizes small all the way through double XL you could use this shirt for screen printing you can use it for casual wear it would be good for schools or even a clothing line if you're looking for a hundred percent cotton ladies t-shirt that's super affordable that 880 might be what you're looking for also note that although this is 100% cotton t-shirt some of the colors that are heathered come with a blended fabric thank you for watching and please subscribe", "0ZKkALOJTm4": "hey guys it's jake in this video i'll be showing you six of my favorite t-shirts and i'll be ranking them on quality fit and price each of these shirts have their own pros and cons which i'll clarify as i talk about them first up is the los angeles apparel one eight zero one g d this is a pretty standard t-shirt it's not incredibly thin like a gildan shirt but also not overly cumbersome like a root porter shirt this shirt is 185 gsm or 6.5 ounces so it has a bit of weight to it but not thick enough to overheat you or feel stiff the makeup is 100 cotton so you need to be careful washing it on hot or you'll risk shrinkage the best washing method for any 100 cotton garment is to wash on cold and hang dry here i'm wearing a size large the sleeves flare out a tiny bit but really not as much as other shirts i'm very picky about my sleeve flaring but i'm comfortable with this amount of flarage the color is a bit on the thicker side hugs my neck but not suffocating me and the length of the shirt is great even though it's a white shirt it's not really see-through like some other cheap white shirts the 1801 gd is fairly true to size from what i can tell this shirt is 24 dollars retail and 7.85 cents wholesale compared to other shirt blanks that range around 6 to 6.5 ounces the wholesale price is sort of in the medium upper price range but you can definitely feel the difference in quality comparison like if you were to compare the laa1801gd at 7.85 cents with the bella canvas 3001 at four dollars the weight difference is night and day the 1801 gd offers a decent selection of colors people tend to prefer neutral colors anyway like black white gray and cream so this blank checks those boxes next is the root porter ultra luxury hoodie this t-shirt is the heaviest blank i'm aware of at the moment if you want a typical street wear look and feel this is your shirt this shirt is 235 gsm or 10.5 ounces which is one of the heaviest sharp links you can buy from any supplier at the moment the makeup is 100 cotton and is already pre-washed so the shrinkage rate is about zero to three percent as dictated on the website i still recommend to wash on cold and hang dry here i'm wearing a size large the sleeves are pretty flarey and it has a baggy oversized fit the collar is thin and hugs my neck not my preferred type of collar i like my collars a little wider to show the collarbones it's more of a boxy cut which some people like it's not my absolute preference but i can't deny the superior quality this shirt is 29 retail and 13.95 wholesale 14 is pretty pricey for just a sharp blink but this is the absolute best shirt you can get as a blank at the moment if you're referring to the quality you can get comparable quality for a little cheaper if you bought bulk wholesale from alibaba but that's not the purpose of this video i'd recommend this shirt if your brand positioning is in the more exclusive luxury market and you price your shirt around 40 to 60 dollars the colors offered are limited to basic neutral colors like white black and cream but they introduce new colors every now and then which are only available on the wholesale store i don't know if these are limited edition colors or if they're permanently added next is the los angeles apparel mt01 yukon army tee this is an interesting shirt it's thick warm and the fit is pretty good this shirt is 230 gsm or 8 ounces the makeup is 90 cotton and 10 polyester this shirt is the softest shirt in this list it's hard to explain it almost feels like a really thin blanket if you plan to try any of these blanks i highly recommend you get this army tee just to see how unique it feels if it's cold outside and you want to wear a shirt underneath your outerwear i definitely pick this shirt first out of all the other choices on this list here i'm wearing a size xl the fit is like a standard shirt sleeves don't flare out as much and the length isn't too long i also like the size of the collar it's a bit on the thicker side and i'm a big fan of how open it is it shows a little bit of the collarbones which i like and chest hair you know if you got any this shirt is 28 retail and 9.70 wholesale i say this price is fair for the quality you get the weight and ounce values are important and can give a general idea of how high the quality of the garment but considering how i know what this feels like it's one of the nicest feeling blanks i've ever felt unfortunately this tea only comes in heather gray which is a huge drawback if this came in other basic colors this would be my absolute go-to shirt for all of my projects next is the gildan 5000 this is going to be your budget shirt if you're just starting out and have close to no capital this is an acceptable starting blank this shirt is 150 gsm or 5.3 ounces and the makeup is 100 cotton there's nothing particularly special about this quality it's not as thin as the bella canvas 3001 shirt which i'll talk about later but it's also not so thick that you'd be complimenting this shirt and referring it to your friends it's just a standard shirt that any club youth group club soccer team or bakery team fundraiser would use here i'm wearing a size xl the sleeves flare out a bit and the collar isn't too thick or too thin and it's not super tight around my neck the white color is a tad bit see-through as with most jeep shirt models the fit is nothing special however you expect the normal shirt to fit that's exactly how it fits this shirt is about a dollar fifty to three dollars retail and that's pretty damn cheap you can find this shirt on most mass clothing distribution websites there's really no need for a wholesale price because it's so damn cheap even though it's so cheap i actually think it's a really good deal i would expect a 5.3 ounce shirt to be maybe four to five dollars but you can get the white color shirt for like a dollar 67 on some vendor size there are plenty of colors to choose from whatever theme or mood you need they definitely have it next is the a.s color classic tee this is a good quality standard tee that you can use in pretty much all of your projects virtually no complaints with this one shirt the shirt is 185 gsm or 6.5 ounces and the makeup is 100 cotton this shirt is super soft like very flowy if that makes sense it moves with your body well and doesn't feel cumbersome at all here i'm wearing a size large the fit on this shirt is great still a standard fit like most shirts in the list the collar is thick but doesn't hug my neck super tightly sleeves have an okay amount of flaring and the length of the shirt is good nothing super special about this shirt it's cheap and feels soft this shirt is 20 retail and 8.85 wholesale which is a great price for a standard yet great quality shirt i tend to use the classic tee and the los angeles apparel 1801gd for lots of my projects and collections i'd say if your shirts are priced 25 dollars to 35 dollars you should definitely use this shirt as your standard go-to blank the shirt has a fair amount of color choices mostly the popular colors some neutral colors and a few brighter tones on an extra related note the as color staple tee seen here in size xl is the exact same as the classic tee except its weight is 6.3 ounces as opposed to the classic 6.5 ounces and it cost 16 retail and 4.95 wholesale as opposed to the classics 20 retail and 8.85 wholesale so if you want a tad bit cheaper version while not sacrificing the quality too much go for the staple tea i actually prefer the staple tea over the classic tea because the collar is a little thinner and more open and since it's only a little bit lighter i prefer the more flowiness of the staple tee this shirt is my usual go-to blank when making collections the final shirt is the bella canvas 3001 this is a lightweight and flowy shirt i feel like this shirt would be best for hot seasons or for people who overheat easily this shirt is 120 gsm or 4.2 ounces with a makeup of 100 cotton watch the shrinking specifically on this blank wash on cold and hang dry here i'm wearing a size xl i like this shirt because it's pretty cheap very light and soft to the touch and i like the way the sleeves lay on my shoulders it's very flowy and stretchy the collar is thin and pretty open very relaxed fit other than that it's another standard shirt fit this shirt is three to four dollars retail and you can find this blank on many clothing distribution websites it's pretty damn cheap so there's no need to get wholesale pricing i think the price to quality trade-off is appropriate this shirt is lighter than the gildan 5000 which is cheaper but this bella canvas 3001 is just more appealing to wear i just love the lightness of it there are a bunch of colors to choose from whatever you want they most likely have it my recommendations if you're just starting out and just want to get product out on a budget get the gildan 5000 as color staple tee or the bella canvas 3001 it just depends on what characteristics you look for in a shirt the gildan 5000 is the cheapest while the as color staplet is the highest quality out of these three i just recommended if you want to stand out a little bit from everyone else then spend a little bit more money and get the la apparel 1801 gd or the as color classic t if you want to get the absolute best blank you can get and money isn't an issue get the rp18x extra note if you're releasing a special t-shirt or a specific graphic that works well on a grey blank then i highly recommend you use that los angeles apparel mt-01 yukon army tee like i said it's unfortunate it only comes in gray heather but if they've released it in extra colors it would be the only shirt i would use you", "HUrjHRy4fhg": "what up guys how you doing Brian here with geek skills and today we are talking about basic tees you know buying a t-shirt used to be pretty easy you go to Costco you go to champs you buy like five or six t-shirts at once and you are good to go but unfortunately it doesn't seem like they make t-shirts like they used to the most recent pack of t-shirts I bought from hmmm or horrible quality they shrank and they developed this weird little ribbing thing on the collar here that looks really really bad so I did all kinds of research online to find out what were the best basic men's t-shirts and what I found was pretty ridiculous I mean I was finding t-shirts for anywhere from 40 to 60 bucks a pop like when did it become so hard to find a good basic tee but after scouring the internet for hours and reading hundreds of reviews I think I finally found the best men's tees and the great thing about them is that they're super cheap and you can get them on Amazon now before we get into the actual t-shirt I think we need to define what a good men's t-shirt is first and foremost a men's t-shirt has to fit well now if you're super jacked like some of those guys on YouTube who recommend clothes then honestly you're gonna look good in anything the sleeves a chest and even the stomach are gonna hug you in all the right places if you're super fit and have an eight-pack but if you have an average build then you're gonna want a t-shirt that hugs you in all the right places and avoid certain areas so that you still look good first and foremost a good men's tee is gonna fit snugly with your arms now if you buy a cheap tee at some place like H&M it's probably gonna have this weird Winnie thing I think you know what I'm talking about it means when your sleeves don't fit quite right and so they wing out to the side like this now there's an aspect of that where that fits in with modern street wear but that's not what we're talking about right now having sleeves that don't fit you right make your arms look small and so for a man it's important to have a t-shirt that fits you right especially around the arms and ideally the sleeves aren't too long so that it shows off a little bit more of your bicep even if you don't have big arms having a t-shirt that fits snugly around the bicep area and is scooted a little bit higher will actually look way better than a shirt with one of those weird wingy things another thing that's annoying about t-shirts is that usually they shrink in the wash that means that you'll go to a store and find a t-shirt that you feel like fits you perfectly and then you go home and you wash it for the first time and then suddenly it's like you're wearing a midriff you want a t-shirt that's the right length not too long and not too short you don't want it to be so long so that it looks like you're wearing a dress and you don't want it too short so that it's showing off your Belford a little bit of your belly if you happen to move in the wrong way and another thing that you want from a good t-shirt is enough space around the stomach area if you have even a little bit of a gut then a slim fitting or tight or thin t-shirt is gonna look weird is it gonna hug you in all the wrong places so a good team will be bagged here around the stomach area but will be tighter around the chest area that's why it's important to find a t-shirt that's tight around the chest tight around the arms but loose around the stomach area so that if you happen to have that little bit of extra of gut it's not hugging in a weird way but it isn't the only thing that matters you also have to look at material quality some people like heavy tees some people like thin tees and it really matters about your preference and maybe the weather in your area but generally speaking you're gonna want a t-shirt that's soft and comfortable to wear but also isn't so thin that it's almost see-through and the last thing is price I mean you can get a cheap t-shirt for like five four dollars you can buy a pack of four or five for 20 and you'll probably get some decent tees that you can wear underneath clothes but if you want to wear the t-shirt by itself it probably is not going to look at that good in the same vein you probably don't want to spend $50 for one t-shirt when you could use that money to buy even like a jacket or something a lot nicer so after doing my research I found these next level tees now I mean literally the brand is called next level and they make these awesome t-shirts that are really snug around the arms and give you plenty of space around the stomach so that your gut doesn't show here's a photo of me wearing the t-shirt before I ever wash them the t-shirts were really long when I first got them but after washing them they shrink to a much more manageable size material quality seems pretty good like I could wear this t-shirt every day and I don't think I'd have any issues it's comfortable it's light it's breathable and it isn't folding in any strange places and at the time of this recording you could buy one other t-shirts for about 6 bucks I've been wearing these t-shirts for a while now and I can honestly say that they check all the right boxes they fit super well they are made of great material and they're the right price I honestly plan on replacing all my t-shirts with these tees eventually the one caveat that I should point out though is that I think the white tees are a little bit more see-through than the darker color tees so if you're looking for a good white tee maybe you buy one first try it out and if it doesn't work for your skin tone or it's a little bit too see-through for you then go ahead and return it so if you want to check out the tees for yourself go ahead and hit the link in the description below you'll be able to check them out for yourself do your own research but honestly after doing hours of work into looking to this I can say that these are the best tee shirts I've ever worn and they are super affordable anyways guys I hope that this video helped you out if you have any questions for me hit me up in the comment section below otherwise I will catch you in the next one see ya you", "ZURo6WJUi54": "hi guys I'm looking a little raggedy today because I'm getting a lot of housework done here on Labor Day but part of what I'm doing one of my chores or tasks today is to take a shirt that doesn't fit me and somehow make it fit me target has these great new Star Wars shirts but they're in the young men's department so they're all athletic fit and they only go up to a 2x so I got a 2x and I need a 3x and a regular fit but I've got a little method that I use to kind of make a shirt work for me and I'm gonna show you that today give me a second here and I'll show you a full shot of what I look like in the shirt okay so here's a full shot of me in the shirt as you can see it's uh not doing me any favors and the sleeves really tight around the midsection getting some unflattering roll action here you can see the my shorts underneath the zipper and all that kind of stuff so not not perfect a little snug I also really don't like how tight the neck is so I'm going to see if I can stretch the fabric a little or work the fabric a little to make it work for me and I'll show you what the processes that I use okay here's a better shot of the graphic you can see it's really cute it's got sort of an 80s vibe to it the fabric is 55% cotton 45% polyester which means once I get this once I work the fabric the way I want to it'll probably pretty much stay that way we're gonna start off making the neck hole a little larger to me when you see the small crew neck neck hole like this it is a clear indicator that a woman is wearing a man's shirt woman's neck holes even for the crewneck shirts tend to be a little bit roomier not as tight so what we're gonna do is make it a little larger by very gently pulling on the fabric notice I'm not pulling on the seams down here when I pull I'm pulling above it now if worse comes to worse and you have a neck hole that will not budge and it's driving you crazy you can cut the neckline off just above the stitching here and it won't be you know the net well the neckline won't fall apart and then when you have like a seam in here too you want to pull in front of that seam and pull behind the seam so that you keep the seam intact okay let's take a look at it and see what it looks like now that we've stretched it out a little bit Wow as you can see that made a huge difference that opening is much much larger now in the shirt and will look a little bit more feminine so the next thing we're going to work on is the sleeves the sleeves on this shirt are a little short and a little tight definitely really really tight around here so what I'm going to do with this is the same thing that I did with the neckline giving it a good stretch being really careful not to overdo it with the seams remember to protect that seam they're a little widen the armhole a little bit and then to get the length that you want on the sleeve to be a little longer you're just going to stretch the fabric down notice I'm doing I'm like I'm sort of like taking it and gathering it up as I go down and pulling it across you don't want to just randomly rip out it be a little thoughtful the process so that is something I'll do I'll pull down on the sleeve more like that I'll repeat everything I did to the sleeve here I'll repeat widening the sleeve and I'll also repeat this process a couple of times to to make it a little wider here just gently pulling the fabric to stretch it so I'm gonna actually take a moment to go through and do that same process to this sleeve a couple of times and then I'll pull over the other sleeve for you and show you the difference and what a difference it makes just to stretch the fabric a little bit okay as you can see after just a moment or two of doing a little bit of light stretching on the sleeve there's a significant difference in the size maybe about three-quarters of an inch in length and width so this is fantastic we'll do this to the other sleeve and then I'll show you what to do to give you a little bit of more volume around the bottom of this of the shirt so for the bottom hem of the shirt you're gonna work it just like you did the neckline and sleeves you want to be very careful and mindful of your stitches that you don't pop them but you're gonna give it a nice steady stretch like this all the way around I like to do it two sometimes three times and you'll do it the entire hem all the way around and then move up the shirt gather the fabric towards you and start doing the same stretch for width across the front and back of the shirt I want you to stop though when you're stretching across the top of your shirt stop when you get to the graphic you do not want to stretch the graphic if you stretch your graphic it's going to crack you want to stretch the areas below it and you can work the areas above it and if you need to get more stretch in the fabric or for this area here across the abdomen or across the bustline you're going to stretch the fabric on the back of the shirt where there isn't too graphic you can work the living daylights out of this fabric back here one of the other key things I want to let you know too is after you've stretched the width of the shirt across the front you're going to grab the fabric and start stretching it lengthwise don't grab the whole shirt just like open it up put your hand inside of it like that and stretch the length if you only stretch the width of the shirt what you're gonna do is you're gonna make the shirt shrink it'll be wider but it'll be shorter so you do have to work the fabric in both directions both across and both down and just be mindful of the graphic and you should be great okay so I put the shirt back on for you so you can get a better look at it I don't know if you can see I try to shoot this so you can see it better but the neckline is not as tight up here a little bit looser a little more room it's not like choking me to death and as you can see it's no longer clinging to my midsection like it was before it's a tiny bit longer I mean actually have that blouse stuff a little bit but it's a shirts a little bit longer a couple inches longer definitely a few inches wider it definitely has more give in room in the sleeves sleeves still aren't my favorite thing I can still work on those because there's yet another step to this process the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to wash the shirt and then after I wash it I'm going to gently go through that same process of where I will pull the fabric across the width and then also the length to continue to give it length and give it a little more give in areas where I need it probably a little more through here and also the sleeves and the neckline so I'll show you that process coming up next well it looks like the shirt came out pretty good straight out of the wash so when I washed it I washed it in cold water with other bright colors and I did it on like a regular cycle light too regular cycle and now that I have a damp I'm taking a look at it and you notice that neckline that maybe looked a little stretched out before like you could see the waffling is no longer there there's no waffling because when I washed it it just maybe it tightened up a little bit I'm not sure but that's one of the things that you can expect to happen when you wash the garment naturally the fibers will tighten up a little bit so what I'm gonna do now now that it's damp is I'm gonna follow those same steps we had before where I'm going to go ahead and work on the neck a little bit be careful here because when it's wet it's going to stretch a lot it'll shrink up a little bit when it dries but it'll really really really really really stretch out a lot when it's wet so you know you don't want to go too far and stretch it out so much that it's completely out of shape so what you want to do though is when you are stretching the fabric every now and then stop take a look at it make sure it's going in the direction that you want it to go in and not like getting overly big or you know hold up the garment on the bottom and make sure your hem is straight all the way across and like your back your garment isn't longer than the front unless of course that's the way you want it so what I'm gonna do is the same thing like I said before that we did before where I'm just gonna gently pull the fabric out my issue that I had before was with the sleeves and I still think the sleeves look kind of small so I'm gonna work on the sleeves a little bit I'm gonna work on the neckline a little bit and probably the bottom hem or like the center section the midsection of the shirt and stretch it out a little bit and then I'm gonna hang it up and I'll show you how I do that I have finished stretching my garment and I think I have it just about the way I want it so now it's time to hang it up I have a little tip for you I use the joy Mangano huggable hangers I think you can get them at Target you can also get them on hsn.com they're great because they have like a little light flocking on the fabric it keeps your shirts and tops and even tank tops and things from slipping off and they're generously sized so you can if you're a plus size person these are great hangers they're not oversized but they are big enough to really accommodate your shirts so one of the things you get sometimes when you're hanging a shirt is where the end of the hanger is you get like a little point and then when you go to put the shirt on this little point of a little poof of fabric sticks out and it looks a little weird and it doesn't lay flat here's a little tip on how to avoid that so I don't know if you can see what I'm doing here but I'm taking this seam in the shoulder and I'm lining it up directly on top of the top edge of the hanger so when you do that this fabric in the shoulder seam is a little stiffer and it's not going to get that little pinch that you sometimes get with hangers but these hangers tend to be better about that anyhow because they come down on the edges on the bottom a little so you probably won't have as much of an issue with that but that's basically what I do I line it up like that and I hang it up so I'm going to hang this up and just let it dry for a day or two and see what it looks like I'll try it on for you and another day or two and we'll see what it looks like if I'm not happy with that I'll probably dampen it again and do another stretching session and then rehang it but I'll be back in a couple days to show you how it turned out well here it is the finished project as you can see a little bit looser in the neckline definitely plenty of room in the bust a lot more room through the midsection and a little bit more length the sleeves have a little more give a little more room and in general it's just a little more comfortable to wear so normally I would wear a woman's 4 or 5 X and if it has Star Wars on it or Disney on the front of the t-shirt you know it's going to be 30 to 60 bucks so eight dollars for shirt from the young men's section that's a 2 XL that I stretched into maybe the size of like a 3 or 4 X in a men's size shirt you can't beat that price eight dollars so you're not only stretching the shirt but you're stretching your budget and you know check out different places like Walmart check out Target and JC Penney's in their men's and young men sections you're gonna find great shirts anywhere from $5 to $15 so much more affordable and a lot of them are in unisex colors like this aqua there's pinks there's purples there's a little mermaid there's all different princesses check it out don't rule it out and you can save a lot of money so go ahead and try this yourself it's worth the investment of just a few dollars and a few minutes of your time you", "_RzxHXJc56k": "how to buy t-shirts wholesale and how to\nget that elusive resale license coming up right now what's up guys Gary

delivering you guys the best cut files and education on mastering your machine in today's video we have a tin Cricut infusible ink packs that you probably did not know we cannot wait to share these with you and if you love cricut and fusible ink just as much as we do be sure to check out our playlist link below we have videos from our first impressions to our beginner's guide and we have tips and hacks on using different types of blanks other than the Cricut brand so be sure to check out that playlist to see the full training but in today's video we're gonna share with you some awesome hacks let's jump into it the first hack is being sure to keep all the oil off your transfer sheets so the in fusible ink is really a transfer sheet for the ink and if you have your hands and your hands with the wheels on it all over it touching it it could potentially mess up your ink and not have for a flawless project so what we're recommending you guys use is some type of brayer if you do not have a brayer they sell these at Cricut they sell these at all the craft stores and some of the art aisle you can see a different artists use these but Cricut has this one on the site with a lot of their sewing when they came out with the maker for putting fabric onto the fabric grip mats so it works really well to help also make sure that you get your infeasible ink transfer sheets onto your mat without ruining any of the sheets another pack is that you always want to make sure to remove the transfer sheet with gravity you guys have watched on our other videos where we lay the mat face down and pill up this is also very important for infeasible ink we also recommend taking the mat and kind of curling it because the transfer sheet is a little bit more like paper rather than vinyl so you can kind of have it already pop out for you guys that way once it's removed you're able to weed it a lot easier and again Cricut does not recommend traditional weeding tools they actually try to recommend guys try to use your hands because it snaps out really easily this next hack is really important if my sound a little crazy but I'm a full believer alright so after you cut out your design before you heat up your ez press here's what we're saying you should do you should grab your Easi press flip it over again an unheated cricut easy press flip it around and place your design right on top of here to make sure it is the proper size so we know that the easy press we have right now is non button on but you would not believe at how many times I thought I made a design non button and it comes to find out is just a little bit larger this is really really important that you're getting nice even heat more than ever with Cricut and fusible ink so you have to have it be a one-hit wonder if you want to make those larger projects I highly recommend getting that larger ez press to have that because if you are heating it multiple times or hitting the area two or three times certain areas on the shirt or fabric or anything will have deeper saturation than other areas so you really are able to tell when you've hit the project multiple times that's why you want to make sure to have it be able to all fit on one so being able to lay it flat down and make sure that there are no pieces of it going off the edge is extremely important with Cricut and fusible ink believe it or not you don't even have to use just Cricut Brandt blanks we love the Cricut brand blanks but there are so many other ones out on Amazon one of our favorites that we actually recommend more than a Cricut blank are these amazing Hanes shirts these are awesome they are fantastic to use and again anything that is made out of at least like 90 to 100% polyester is going to work great with cricut infusible ink and we have a whole video comparing different blanks so if you're interested to see where you could save money and where you can get some alternatives and be sure to check out that video in the playlist but there are so many other types of blanks that you and use to make the possibilities truly endless that you can find over on Amazon this is a big one guys for any cloth material you want to make sure to use a lint roller to remove any residue any lint from the shirt even if it has been prepackaged you want to make sure there is no lint no hair no nothing to keep you from a flawless - Jean transfer so use a lint roller and anything that is non cloth use one of these little microfiber lens cleaners to clean off the surface again from any oils any lint anything like that from your coasters or anything that is just non cloth okay that is going to save you a lot and again make sure you get a flawless project every single time this is one that a lot of people are not sure about but as long as you do not see ink on your butcher paper feel free to reuse it now granted it's a very affordable thing to purchase we purchased this large large roll of butcher paper on Amazon and man oh man has is it really affordable so if you are weary and worried about you know any ain't getting transferred over on the butcher paper from our testing you would be able to reuse butcher paper quite a bit but you can also order it in bulk like we did for around $20 and have probably enough but your paper to last you a lifetime honestly and it's very affordable so feel free to reuse it if you're short on butcher paper and you don't want to run out to Walmart at late it not or anything like that as long as you do not see any ink that could be on there that is the one thing you want to look out for but as long as there's no ink on it feel free to reuse it another great hack is that if you have multiple easy press mats like we do we always recommend you guys to light one on your surface and then one inside the shirt tote bag anything like that again making sure to follow the traditional directions with printer paper or something like that to protect the other side of your surface to protect your easy press mat from Inc this one right here is a little tricky so stick with me always preheat your surface whether it be a tote bag a sure coaster anything like that with your easy press but you need to make sure to let that cool completely before applying your Cricut and fusible link transfer sheet to the surface because if you apply it and it's warm with iron on it would be totally fine but with the ink it could start transferring too soon and we do not want that so if you want a flawless design again be sure to preheat all your material to make sure there's no moisture in the shirts or fabric or anything like that but be sure to let that cool completely before you go ahead and lay the transfer sheet down onto the project this next one is also kind of crazy we were testing versus a laser printer paper that is so hard to find versus regular copy paper and believe it or not for both the cricket and fusible link pins and these pins we have right here to compare they both work great on laser paper as well as regular copy paper and if that you know how hard it is to find laser printer paper you will know how awesome it is that you can actually use regular printer paper so if you guys try that at home leave us a comment and let us know your results of using that regular copy paper too if you're working with coasters mugs anything like that you can use heat tape to make sure that the image is going to stay down onto your project and you do not even have to use the Cricut heat tape you can pick this up on Amazon for quite a bit cheaper and we have found that it works great either way you go isn't that awesome there's so many hacks in different ways to use different materials than just what Cricut provides so we cannot wait to see what you're making with infeasible ink

quick but it's very interesting trick about sublimation as you all know you cannot print white on on a dark t-shirt on the dark garment with sublimation simply because there is no waiting and even if there will be white ink it will it won't I don't think there will be OPEC enough to to stay on the undershirt you wouldn't die the shirt so you would have to use some kind of discharge before so so if you bored with with printing on just a polyester mags and and stuff that's widely available for your suppliers try to think outside of the box a little bit so I will show you something different today so as you can see there is an image and is white it's on a black background so this is what I hope it will look on my dark t-shirt and this will be printed with tight sublimation printer and with dye sublimation ink there is no special formula formula for those things is just a general sublimation energy used for printing on mags and and other items so let me go to my layers window so here we go this is how it will print you probably won't say it's just a slightly slightly white greyish on it will be on the paper so on the t-shirt you should look like this so I'll go ahead and I print it off on the very special paper and we'll show you well I hope I will show you how it will look one once is pressed to the to the t-shirt ticket will be black well it's not going to be t-shirt I just try to press it on some kind of scrub cotton material so go ahead and print some artwork first and see you in a minute so here I am back so job is printed and hopefully I get the property as you can see is printed lightly gray and ink is still wet so the trick is we as I mentioned there is no no white pigment in the sublimation printer but there is a great so what we were gonna do we're gonna help we're gonna help the ink with white pigment powder so this is how it's done wet image you probably seen similar stuff on YouTube you know the thing is we just won't we just want print where the ink is we don't want anyone else so we're gonna have a go my scrap nevermind anyway so this is the this is the this is like a pigment powder so what we have to do now need to dry we need to dry the image so the in same thing to the pigment so that sink into the pigment so here we go I'm going to put it under the press for a couple minutes just like this so he's a so you dry out I will see you in a second okay so a couple of minutes just gone so the image should be dry I'm not gonna touch it just in case it isn't I don't know if you can see you can see that with the powder here done and just remember guys this is just normal sublimation ink just I just printed it gray there's nothing special in here there's no special inks no special printers is just a special paper and special powder coating so um so I never done it before you might be a failure but you never know until you try so here we go so this is the scrub cotton scrap cotton shirt I'm going to repress it and now it's a big moment will you work oh really no image might be slightly too big for that for my tiny little press off we don't see you in a few seconds okay guys 10 seconds to go six and we'll see if this is a game changer oh this is a failure as I said first time I'm doing it so I have no idea what to expect I just following them I'm just following instruction from the supplier and they say to cool it down don't don't lift the paper when he's warm so we just lay here I'm not gonna turn the camera off so you can see it you just cool it down on the table and beef moment in a minute in tea in theory there shouldn't be an image because as I said is a cotton that's a sublimation sublimation dollar we've gotten and there is no and the light ink doesn't show up on the dark so let's have a look that is quite cold no just give it a few more seconds to be sure oh there is a image there you go there is a image look at that nice there is a image something we made as well he's not sublimated but he's use of sublimation printer he's very very grainy I think maybe I just didn't do enough powder but that's quite cool that it's quite cool that's actually not but let's have a look with another scrap and the other text I prepared I'm not sure if that drawing yet so we give it a few seconds and let's try this craft if the scrap is big enough should be just just big enough just press it and trim it so I can see why powerful places okay apply image class and wait take ten seconds left and no see if that attempt will be also have any good now let's zoom in to that I think we can release an image well there is an image look at this right so now I don't know guys is this acceptable for sublimation I don't think so so I'm not sure if I'm doing everything correctly from the images that supplier send me that image should be dead-on white to me is very grainy so looks like one I didn't apply enough powder oh I may be over dry there but they definitely differently there is an image I don't try to the mean that and he's very very softly no if you have to distress look that's that's good babe that could be your your thing but anyway I've got one more thing to show you again I didn't I didn't try that before so everything is from the PDF that supplier sent me so please bear with me and I will be back with another print in a minute all right so here I am back with living you art won't let go don't know if you can see in fingers there is a unicorn that printed with grey so this supposed to be very attractive effect on the dark or dark government and we're gonna tell you what it is yet but because I wanna I wanna see I'm gonna see if you say so here we go so we with the solution yeah now probably you can see already what it is then yeah yeah very funky very funky oh can you say it now he's a glitch ha here we go so let's see how this glitch I will show up on the dark government so we're gonna try me I can see lots of data around the image so let's try I don't know if you can see these lovely enshrining let's zoom in okay so I've got my scrap look at my scrap pre-press and then for 34 seconds we're going to press a unicorn see you some on a couple seconds left six seconds to be precise and we're going to see if this is a oh boy oh boy effect oh he's a disappointment so I'll let it cool down first actually if you can say hey this is very very sparkly powder so in theory there should be sparkly unicorn show up on the dark t-shirt and this is oh all with the sublimation ink and a bit of a special powder okay so look one two three woo actually unicorn die oh oh I like that I don't like the little little bits of unique sorry glitter around the image by two like that I don't like the sublimated dance already printed unicorn so this is some definitely yes for me let's try the is quite stretchy yeah that's brilliant that's actually I really like it so here we go so we've got semi-decent or maybe not even semi-decent a white print we have we have a distressed look yeah she's not too patterned on this on this artwork and a unicorn nice and shiny glittery okay so I have a one more thing for you one more thing obviously we have to try this powder on white garment so I will be back in three seconds okay I'm back with some white scrap t-shirt I just heard lying around and another image of Isis pretty obviously coated already and these protists is exactly same as with all the ones you just put the paper put the powder on your image paper is exactly the same just trim it and try to apply it on white effect if he's going to be a disappointment let me remind you I'm printing with a sublimation ink on a sublimation printer on a sublimation paper but it's a special paper it's not there's normal paper you could just buy like a tropics orders and on a cotton t-shirt so this is not polyester shirt is a cotton shirt you cannot sublimate to the cotton but you can prefer a kit to sublimate on the treatment so it does work sometimes the old supply is all over the world trying to come up with a better and better ideas all the time but obviously some of them better some of them the worse but this is another one so let's have a look let's give them a chance we want the game change or do we Hey and as usual 34 seconds 3 2 1 beep so let's call it down simple last time a few seconds and we're going to see if you work okay one two or three Oh blimey all night I like that hello there is a pop and there's a massive pop up on it and he's extremely soft look at this oh I want to try another one that is great that is fantastic actually huh it doesn't crack he's extremely extremely soft so I'm trying another one sorry guys I'm excited right now love it you want the same page so see how that want to adult some two lovely parrots five seconds left boom down that is that is really good that is really good guys this is the best I've seen when you print in on the cotton with sublimation ink this is best I've seen obviously this is not inside the shell this is on that powder this is the undercoating that is extremely soft I would love to just say it how we wash I will try to wash it a couple times and I will keep obviously our update you know this okay Schumi should be cold enough now what were you gonna say about this that's all that's all on the video yeah no extremely soft this is a very suitable product so yeah I will be happy with that in a shop I'll be happy with this I've got another image it's slightly too big I don't know if you see what's gonna happen but right now we can actually trim it a bit use a car you looks quite done colors I would like to see how he turns now so it's slightly too big no let's try one second yeah some paper left but God look at that color so trying to peel it off I can't peel the paper off I think I said you were still too warm oh yeah here we go there was a okay I don't know guys I'm not gonna tell you anything about this product much yeah because this is first time I'm doing it you need a fervor test but what I see is extremely good on the on the white it's extremely good on a white cotton but you need a forever type like washing tests and all this so you", "EOpkP-R2CuU": "what's going on guys in this video we're gonna talk about how you can start a t-shirt business from home with as little as five hundred dollars let's not waste any time and get right into it check us out guys we're going by calm type in Jordan shirt and here you'll see a bunch of t-shirts so these shows will cost us around $2 to make you will need around five hundred dollars to buy all the equipment and you'll be able to make these at home these are gonna be professional quality store ready t-shirts so let's take a look at this t-shirt right here let's click on it so this seller didn't do a good job with the listing the image is horrible and the shirt is all wrinkled but still he sold 115 of these t-shirts for $20 and so he's making over $10 per shirt let's click right here and this is how many he sold so just today he sold two three four he sold for these t-shirts so off of one t-shirt he made $40 you guys can make a ton of different t-shirts from athletes and musicians to movies to much more so let's talk about how to make these shirts the first thing we're gonna do is go on a website called jittery shirts calm this is the website where we're gonna buy our blank t-shirts we're gonna buy the Gildan g500 t-shirt this is one of the most common t-shirts and it's good because it has a tare weight label so it's very convenient the show will cost around a dollar sixty cents the second thing you guys will need a special inkjet principle heat transfer paper you can get these in different sizes such as eight-and-a-half by 11 and 11 by 17 the small one is called a four and the large one is called a three you will need light transfer paper for white t-shirts and black transfer paper for dark t-shirts when you're first starting out you guys should buy these on Amazon and then you can buy the wholesale and Alibaba for around thirty cents a sheet for the large ones the next thing you guys will need is a Epson WUF 7710 printer and the fourth thing is a large heat press machine so the first thing we have to do is mirror the image let's click tools flip horizontal and now ready to print alright so when you put it on the white t-shirts we're gonna insert an 11 by 17 white paper into the printer an image I just want you guys to understand one thing even though I'm printing with a inkjet printer the ink will never smudge it will be impossible to make the income off the t-shirt the shirt will have to be destroyed this is gonna be a professional quality t-shirt the ink is gonna melt with a thin piece of vinyl onto the t-shirt so when the paper is printed it's not gonna look too bright but when it's on the shirt isn't look much better the next step is to cut out all the white parts the image you can do this with scissors or if you want better results you could do this with a paper cutter don't worry if you don't cut it perfectly because the white areas are barely seen my friend the image is now ready to be printed on the shirt all right guys the next step we're gonna take a blank shirt we're gonna preheat it to get the moisture out we're gonna put the part of the t-shirt which will print on onto the heat plate wait for the silicone paper and press it for about 10 seconds you guys see steam coming out that's fine don't worry and now we'll do the same thing for some bottom the next step is gonna take the image I'm gonna align it on the t-shirt Airport and then we're gonna use paper tape or you guys can use special heat transfer tape to take the image on shirt and now we're gonna transfer an image onto the t-shirt and now I'm going to press it at 300 let's say 50 degrees for around 15 seconds so right now is a very important part if you guys peel while the shirt is hot you're gonna get a matte finish if you guys have the shirt cool off and peel when it's cold the finish will be glossy for this shirt we're peeling it hot to have a matte finish make sure you take the tape off very carefully and as you guys can see we have a professional finished t-shirt if you guys look on the bottom right there's a very small white scratch this happened because the paper was scratched before printing so always make sure to inspect the paper prior to printing otherwise the prints come out perfectly every single time it's almost impossible to mess with the printer we're almost finished we just have to do one more thing and that's to stretch out the shirt and repress it one more time for about 10 seconds to make sure the shirt lasts a long time now we're gonna stretch a shirt out to make sure it lasts a long time when I press one more time put the silicone paper on and do a very quick five-second press the show zone alright guys now we're gonna do a black t-shirt it's nice on paper for this example we're gonna put the small image on the a4 paper so when you're printing on black t-shirts the image does not need to be mirrored we're gonna use our cutter to cut out all the white areas and that we're ready to eat president image so now I'm gonna press the black shirt quick ten-second press so the next step is to carefully peel the top layer [Music] and now we're going to carefully line the image onto the t-shirt now I'm gonna put it into the heat press and press the image press it for around ten seconds at 320 degrees Fahrenheit now with no move the silicone paper do a quick stretch and our shirt is done alright guys the next step is to make our shirt labels the best way to do this is by making plaster salt heat transfer labels you can get these for around 10 cents if you order in large quantities just make sure the image is mirrored before sending it to the seller we're gonna go into google and type in shirt label template right here you'll get a template for the labels you guys can Photoshop your own if you want we will download one of the sample labels and heat transfer it to the shirt I strongly recommend you guys get the classes on cue transfers if you want flawless results every time but if you guys want to do it yourself and get a special Oki laser printer and special heat transfer paper and try it out there is a learning curve to this and the results are not going to be as good as the plastisol labels let's carefully tear away the gilding tag alright guys so we're gonna place our label onto the shirt place the silicone paper over it and heat presses and now let me slowly peel the label when the shirt is finished you will package it in a plastic bag which will cost you around five to ten cents you will then take photos of the t-shirt let's talk about two very important parts of this business the first one is reinvesting money back into the business so for example if you start with $100 you can make 50 t-shirts and $2.00 each shirt if you sell those 50 t-shirts at $10 you will have $500 if you take the $500 you can make 250 t-shirts if you sell the 250 t-shirts at $10 you will have 2,500 and so on the second thing is you guys have to make t-shirts which don't have trademarks and copyrights this is very important if you want to have a long stable business get creative and make really cool t-shirts I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did please leave a like to subscribe and if you have any questions please ask in the comments below I'll see you guys in the next one", "iBKiHxTN_CM": "what's up everyone Rory from t-shirt dot CA here today we are showing

watches into Roger Henson the frame cuz the game treats phony friendship all right man I'm excited for this video I'm feeling good this is a topic I really haven't discussed on this channel much and I know that may seem kind of odd and almost impossible but trust me I haven't made a video about graphic t-shirts really ever there's a ton that goes into these style tees the material the brand where you got it from the graphic obviously so I'm gonna break all that down for you right now let's do it I'm gonna start off with one of my favorite brands these should be no surprise to you I've had him in my collection for a while now I've shown them to you before but we gots to see they've been around for so long they are one of the original streetwear brands and a while back I was like okay there's so many streetwear brands out there let me just choose a few that I really identify with and Stussy has always spoke to me you know the skate and surf background I like that a lot so you know I've really been rocking with them and I don't mind investing a little bit of money into their t-shirts they hit anywhere from like thirty to fifty eight dollars so you know certainly expensive some of them but you can always catch them on sale like any t-shirt brand especially a streetwear brand puts tees on sale at some point this is also a stew CT and I just really liked their graphics stuff that stands out to me basketball skateboarding fishing paradise you know these tropical settings all that type of stuff I like you can buy Stussy tees in a bunch of different places if I find any sales I'll be sure to link them down in the description they fit true to size in my opinion keeping it moving I got a t-shirt from bodega and you'll find that a lot of the big sneaker boutiques are releasing their own clothing you know it took a little while for some of these shops to get a good designer in there and release some strong graphics and good cutting so stuff but bodega has consistently been releasing good clothing and this year they've been dropping a bunch of teas that are fire in my opinion it's local to me so I went in store tried them on and I bought a couple this is one of them it's the bodega Wireless tea so this one here is made in the USA god I appreciate that nice quality material it's got a small bodega wireless graphic in the front and then on the back large and in charge I don't know why but this just reminded me of when I had a sidekick and used to go into the t-mobile store to pay my bill I don't even know why I was paying my bill in store all the time what was they thinking why was that going in store to pay my bills do they not have online payment options I don't even know I used to really go into the mall and pay my bill every month like that's wild this graphic is a little bit more bold and loud than I typically would wear this year I just feel like wearing graphic stuff is really on trend and I'm comfortable with it so you know I had to support my local shop I got another tee I'll show you guys at a different time and then I was planning on going back but they sold out so if you like something make sure you don't sleep okay so switching gears a little bit and leaving Street we're going into the menswear side of things we've got a polo bear tee a lot of you have seen these tees you know they're in pretty much every polo outlet every Ralph Lauren store polo has been pushing these bear tease a lot this one's from the outlet and you know there's nothing wrong with buying a polo t-shirt or anything from outlet for that matter I buy a lot of stuff there you know you can try it on it makes it easy there's always a sale I got this a few weeks back it retailed for 40 bucks I think I paid like high 20s like 28 29 or something like that so obviously it's in this fun the summertime yellow color and then you've got the beach vibes with the bear just ready to break out a beach volleyball game this tee is definitely something I'll be wearing a lot it's just a distinct polo item and it's classic and I don't think that they're gonna go out of style okay next up I got a little side part for you guys because this is an important topic and I kind of wanted to cut it out from the rest of the video this is not a specific brand or anything like that this is pretty much talking about thrifting shirts or buying cheap tourist location type shirts so this is totally different it's no secret that you can buy great t-shirts of all different kinds at a thrift store that's probably going to be your best place to find a unique variety that's cheap so if you're on a budget and you're not hitting up thrift stores and you like those style tees I know what you doing so I thrifted this Florida tea right here I don't know how old it is but I just loved the graphic in the front it's an older Jersey Blanc tea but it's made in the USA there really wasn't any one that had worn this tea it looked brand spankin new so a lot of people go to the thrift store and they want stuff that's been washed it looks like it's vintage and it's old I kind of go the opposite direction I know that sounds kind of crazy I want to find an old t-shirt that doesn't have much wear to it and that kind of stuff is really hard to get your hands on but it does exist trust me people buy t-shirts in bulk or when they're traveling and they just never wear it and then eventually they donate it you'd be surprised how many newish t-shirts pop up at the thrift store that are still old stuff that's like five or ten years old anyway I have no idea how old this thing is but the design is really what sold me I love the palm trees the Sun set the font of the Florida logo on the top and that's the next thing I want to talk about location tees state tees souvenir t-shirts stuff that really isn't made to be worn in a street wear way but that's kind of the way I've been liking to wear these style t-shirts this next one behind me is a New Hampshire t-shirt I got this when I was up at Lake Winnipesaukee which I'm going to again this weekend I'm definitely gonna try to grab another one of these this is from Walmart so if you're ever in a random location and you want to find a good graphic State t-shirt check out Walmart my brother is actually the one that put me on to this so shout out to you Nick he's like we got to hit up the local Walmart and see what they have for teas I was like what Walmart for t-shirts that is one thing that I never really thought I was gonna do but Here I am talking about it in the video so it's got this cool hummingbird and floral design at the top and it says New Hampshire down at the bottom I wore this in a couple look books and I got messages and emails from people asking me where they could get this exact t-shirt I didn't think anyone was gonna care wherever you travel this summer go check out a Walmart or a tourist location or wherever and check out the t-shirts go for some pigment dyed tees or anything that has a cool font or graphic design on the front definitely do that while you're traveling this summer I know that's not necessarily a brand so I'm gonna mention a few other ones Carhartt work-in-progress definitely check out their stuff Jordan and Nike surprisingly has been putting out a lot of good graphic tees so check their but let's keep it moving because I got one more brand to show you guys and I bought a ton of t-shirts from them already this summer ok so getting back to the street wear side of things this brand has been killing it I recently dropped over a hundred bucks on their tees easily every release they've had I've seen at least four or five tees and other items that I've wanted you guys know undefeated is definitely one of the best sneaker shops around huge in California but they also make amazing t-shirts in my opinion I actually have never been to one of their stores which is crazy I got to get out to California in general just to hang out there but that's another conversation their clothing recently though it's just so fire this one is in this orange apricot color with a university type logo this one though is a little bit different obviously it's black and it's got this gradient undefeated logo but then the back check that out this is one of the coolest graphics I've seen on a t-shirt recently so you got a basketball player about to throw it down in black and white and then you also have that same script undefeated logo at the bottom here this is definitely one of my favorite newest t-shirt pickups I would say and I've been waiting to break these out because pastel colors this summer they're huge as well so say you've got some shoes they have like this pinkish purple color this tee right here is a nice accent to those shoes so be sure to let me know which one of these t-shirts you guys like the best what are some brands that you guys are wearing this summer leave it down in the comments section put us on to some newer or older brands that you've been wearing that we should check out there's so many that are out there so I really hope you guys enjoyed this video make sure you hit the thumbs up if you did subscribe if you're new a lot more summer content is on the way I keep saying that because it's true and I keep bringing these summer videos so if you've missed any of them make sure you go check them out we're gonna end

know how much I love my Pinterest I am on Pinterest every day I have about 35,000 pins in my my account and many boards and one that caught my eye a few months ago and I've been wanting to do it and show you guys is how to turn a stiff shirt this one is very stiff into one of those soft vintage feel like this one this is so soft it's like a baby's blanket this is my son Jonathon shirt now my boys my boys love to wear t-shirts and they tend to go to like the character t-shirts like these are Batman Marvel Comics and all that stuff because of the way it's made a lot of these shirts are very soft and vintage looking and so when they wear it specially here where we live during the summertime it goes up to like 90 95 degrees it's very hot it's very humid they don't want to wear something like this that's so heavy for them and so thick this is one of my husband's favorite shirts because of course it says Hawaii it's a Hawaiian shirt actually says Hawaiian strength but he had gotten this in Hawaii during one of his visits there and he has a love and hate relationship with this shirt he loves it but then he hates to wear it so I figured I'd wanted to since I saw this on Pinterest I wanted to go ahead and surprise him turn this hard feeling t-shirt into a soft vintage one alright the recipe to turn your hard shirts into a soft vintage feel only requires two ingredients four cups of water and half a cup of salt place everything into your container I'm just using one of my kitchen Pyrex because it's the right size for me and mix it well make sure the salt is well dissolved into that water okay the salt is fully dissolved I have my shirt here my husband's shirt and I'm going to go ahead and fold it nice and flat so that it soaks into that water and just make sure that your um your shirt is fully covered in that water okay and we're supposed to brine it we're supposed to brine it for three days and brining is just a process of just letting it sit I'm going to go ahead and let it sit outside it's a nice weather outside it's not hot it's not cold and then every evening I'm just going to put it put it inside or else I can also place it in my laundry room so either way where you guys decide to place it just make sure that um once in a while every day or two just Pat it in and make sure all the the fabric is covered and I will see you guys in three days Aloha friends it has been three days this thing has really soaked in well it's been brining and now I'm going to go ahead and give it a regular wash and it's supposed to have a vintage feel to it let's go see how it works out alright friends here is the final result went ahead and washed it twice and the result I'm pretty happy with them okay with it I think it actually did work it's not vintage soft soft but it is it is a lot softer than what it originally was and I have to take into consideration that I did start off with a very heavy cotton shirt this was very thick it wasn't just the regular cotton t-shirt this one was super thick but hubby have already tried it and he can't feel the difference specially along along the sleeves this DIY of turning your your regular t-shirt into vintage vintage t-shirt does work at some point it won't turn it super vintage like you know like this super thin but it does you know line it up a bit maybe I'll even try one day of just doing another batch of the the salt and and the water brine and see how it does work but um for now I'm pretty happy with it so I give it thumbs up thank you guys for watching this quick video of how to turn your regular t-shirt into vintage shirts and like I said I think it works and I hope you guys try to Maha", "swVT28mZni0": "welcome to the Sewing Report I'm\nJennifer Moore and we are continuing our embroidery adventures with the Brother\nPE 800 we are doing t-shirts in this episode I'm using 100% cotton t-shirts I\ngot these from jiffy shirts I will link them below I'm folding my shirt in half\nfirst marking the center line with an air soluble pen and then using my ruler\nto mark the center line I pre treated the t-shirt with terial magic which is a\ntemporary fabric stabilizer now I'm going to cross the chest I lined up the\nunder sides of the sleeves and did a horizontal line and these are going to\nbe my grid lines for hooping for this shirt I use two layers of sheer cutaway\nstabilizer and I did this because it's a white shirt so I didn't want it to\nsee-through I'm hoping this shirt I also put a layer of water-soluble\ntopper over it since it is a knit I'm using my 5 by 7 inch hoop and now I am\ntaking the t-shirt away lifting it up so that nothing gets caught in the\nembroidery machine so this shirt is actually for friend named Melanie and\nthis is her business logo Melanie loves Tampa Bay I'm also helping her and make\na youtube channel so I'm a link her channel below if you are interested at\nall in real estate homeownership and Tampa Bay life videos we've been making\nsome fun things so I had her logo digitized from a shop I found on Etsy\nand I will also share that as well now one thing I did struggle with was the\nheart in the logo it was rather dense which is why I use two layers of\nstabilizer instead of just one that helped prevent it from curling and it\nkept the design nice and flat as I'm stitching out the design I'm\ngoing through and cutting out my loose threads during the process I just found\nit was a little bit easier so that the threads didn't get caught under\nstitching later on and this whole design probably took about 25 minutes yeah I\nknow now I actually had two different\nversions of the logo digitized it cost about ten bucks each I had one that just\ngoes horizontally and then I have a stacked logo as well so we're actually\ngonna do two shirts in this video for whatever reason these designs stitch\nout better when I loosened the upper thread tension I believe this was on 1.6\nor 1.8 and this is again a hundred percent cotton knit but because i\nstabilized it with the terial magic as well made stitching out this design a\nlot easier highly recommend that stuff I know it's probably tempting because this\nis taking so long to like walk away take a bathroom break I would not do that\nbecause the minute you walk away that's the minute something goes wrong so for\nthese shirts I actually literally stood over the machine just to make sure\nnothing was out of place and everything was going smoothly okay now I'm removing more of the\nconnecting threads with my seam ripper and some tiny scissors then I'm going to\ntear away the water-soluble topper flip the shirt inside out and cut away this\nstabilizer and actually the scraps are big enough that I could probably use\nthem using one of these smaller homes and there's t-shirt number one all right\nonto t-shirt number two use the same process fatir ile magic the two layers\nof the sheer cut away and I actually used painters tape to try to keep the\nshirt out of the way the rest of the shirt and that worked out pretty well all right\nsame thing on hooping this shirt cutting away the excess stabilizer here trimming all those connecting threads\nwith my seam ripper and the little scissors and then pulling away the\nwater-soluble topping stabilizer and there's t-shirt number two hope you\nenjoyed that look at what it takes to

Since dye is one of the quickest and easiest ways to add color to a project, or to an existing piece of fabric,\ntoday I'm going to be demonstrating a simple immersion technique using Rit Dye. Rit Dye is great for all skill levels because it contains a mixture of several different types of dye, making\nit a really great option if you want to dye something that's a blend or contains multiple kinds of fibers For this project you'll need: Rit Dye in\nwhatever colors you like, we're using navy and black Something to dye, in our case we're using a cotton bag Buckets, Gloves, some salt, and something to stir with like a stick, or a spoon. Before you start it's a pretty\ngood idea to make sure that you have your workspace covered, so we just have a really cheap plastic\ndrop cloth here they're pretty easy to find at the hardware store, but anything you might have laying\naround your house is a good idea too, so a bed sheet, or a canvas drop cloth, or an old rag, just something to make sure that you're\nnot getting dye everywhere. You also want to make sure that you have some gloves, And an old hoodie, or a t-shirt or an apron. Pre-washing your fabric will get you\nbetter dye coverage so if you can, try not to skip this step. It's also useful\nif your material is still a little bit damp when you dye because it'll help\nsoak up color faster, and with fewer bubbles. When mixing dye colors, it's important to\nstart with the lightest color first, and slowly add in your black or\ndarker shades. To make our dye bath, we're gonna start\nwith our navy blue Rit Dye. Since we're dyeing about a pound a\nfabric, we're gonna add half of the container\nsince the container will dye up to 2 pounds of fabric. To get a darker shade of navy blue, like indigo, we're going to add just a splash of black. The last thing we want to do before we\nenter our fabric into the dye bath is add our salt. It's a good idea to use about 1/4 cup per 1/2 pound of fabric. For this project we're using about a gallon of water just to get even coverage over our fabric. You want to make sure that there's enough water to cover your project easily, so that it can be fully immersed in the dye bath. Once our dye is mixed, we're going to drop our fabric in. Make sure to mush it all around and be\nsure that there are no bumps or bubbles in the fabric. That air will give you some\ninconsistencies which can be really pretty, but ultimately are not what you're looking\nfor with the full immersion dye bath. We're going to let this batch of fabric sit in there for about half an hour, so that we get a nice rich color. After about a half an hour of soaking, check on your fabric and see if it has reached your desired shade. When you're ready to remove your fabric,\ntake it out and gently bring it back into the bucket to get off any excess dyes. To rinse, start with hot water.  This will open up the fibers and make sure that you're able to rinse out all the dye. As the water starts to turn clear, begin to add some cold water. This transition into cold water will help the fibers shrink back up and lock in any remaining dye. Don't be afraid if the shade looks a little darker than what you wanted.  Wet fabric always looks darker. And there you have it, you've added a fresh new color to some fabric. You can wash these anyway you like, Rit Dye is really good at being steadfast in the wash, but if you're like me and you want to keep them looking clean and pristine, you'll hand wash them gently in cold water. Thanks for watching this OFS project!", "N0fWD0aYpRY": "hey everyone I'm Teen Vogue's fashion news editor Alyssa Hardy and I'm Harrison sea Krait celebrity stylist and fabrication expert and today Harrison is gonna teach us what goes behind the price tag of everyone's favorite wardrobe table t-shirts Harrison is going to use his insight and expertise to compare two shirts he'll walk me through the fit feel and fabric and I'll use this new knowledge to determine the price of the mystery shirt so Alyssa what do you love most about t-shirts t-shirts are really versatile you can dress it up you can dress it down you can wear it with a skirt you can wear it with jeans and it's just something that everybody wants needs to have in their closet a good one having a great t-shirt is just essential and hopefully after today you will be able to determine which one is cheap and which one is expensive let's do it as a fashion editor what did you think about our mystery stay here hmm TAS but I think I'm gonna go for now with cheap okay so the first fabrication we're going to talk about is fiber content and this can be broken down in natural fibers and synthetic natural fibers that are most commonly used are silk cotton linen and wool and these subcategories are alpacas your cashmere is micro fibers and your ball hair for your inexpensive fabrics these are your synthetics synthetic fibers include polyester rayon which is a great substitute for silk acetate which is about as breathable as plastic so if you see that on a label you definitely want to stay away if you're looking for durability and your acrylics if we're gonna look at white white typically is always gonna be made from cotton when I am determining if a shirt is made of good quality I do a light test just hold the fabric up to the light and normally if you can't see through it it's more expensive if you can see through it the material has been processed and nine times out of ten the care label will read synthetic interesting which one of our mystery research is the more expensive this is tough your light test situation and that's kind of got me thinking that this one is the expensive one and this one is the cheap one final answer that's my final sir perfect you said based on the light test this is more expensive 98 dollars for an expensive t-shirt not a bad you know price for these yeah and for this t-shirt it was inexpensive $9.99 the light test was definitely effective yeah so now based on what you know about fiber fabrication does that make you want to change an answer on the mystery t-shirt hmm man this one's tough I think I need to know more so for now I'm gonna stick with you so a known fact about major retailers to produce all those same shirts they put it on a laser cutter they stack materials on top of each other and they cut everything at once a good determining factor when looking at a laser cut t-shirt is the seams before even trying on a t-shirt lay it flat if you see the seams coming in I level and not straight nine times out of ten that's a cheaper material interesting often times the leftover scraps from laser cutting that's where seams are made from that's where the sleeves are made from yeah there have been times where I've bought a cheaper shirt because I just needed something quick and then you wash it once and because it doesn't fit correctly you get a hole in the armpit or a hole on the side see and that's essentially because the shirts were just scraps and the major retailer just did that to produce as many shirts as possible you'll never get that from an expensive teeth as far as the fit if you're looking at a shirt and it already has the outline and silhouette of a body that's probably more expensive because it's already tailored to your body type before even trying it on is that for a woman's shirt specifically or is that like all types of t-shirts it's more commonly found in women's apparel but definitely a higher price a man's apparel you can see cut lines in the t-shirt which one of our misty research is the more expensive it's tough because by looking at it I'm I would have thought that this was the more expensive one but this one seems to have more of that curve that you were talking about so this is really difficult to determine but I'm gonna go this being the more expensive one I think I don't know so let's see if you're right so based on looking at both shirts I would say this is the more boxy silhouette so I would think it is the most inexpensive too much off though yeah 40 bucks based on what you know about fit and construction do you want to change the answer on the mystery sir here based on what you said with the seams and the silhouette I think I'm gonna stick with cheap okay so the next step is looking at the seams and stitching the more attention to detail the same has essentially it's more expensive so when looking at a t-shirt if you happen to not discover a stitch nine times out of ten its invisible literally where the stitch should be pull it apart you'll see the stitch that was done with the mattress stitcher that's a clear indication that the shirt is expensive this is actually a tip that my mom told me when dealing with patterned shirts literally look at the seams if the pattern matches on the same expensive and the pattern is off inexpensive brilliant mom okay those are really straightforward tips so it looks like they're both pretty on point as far as the pattern in the stitch but I would say that the invisible stitch seems like harder to find on this shirt I think I think this is the more expensive shirt it does appear to be expensive but I notice the pattern is off I didn't even check that I am you probably looked at the right side because you're right-handed right always check both seams so because the pattern is off I'm gonna guess that this shirt is the inexpensive based on the double stitching around the neckline and the fact that you have stitching here and as I said the more intricate stitching always is a great determining factor that a shirt is expensive this would be the most expensive shirt interesting so now based on what you know about stains our stitching would you keep the same answer for the mystery to you Wow let's take a look at the seams that looks pretty intricate I think I'm gonna change my answer or too expensive okay all right Alyssa so I'm gonna give you one last test when you're in a store you do the pool test if you hold the fabric and pull it normally if the fabric drops and it does not hold the shape of the wrinkle it's expensive if you do the pool test and it holds the wrinkle nine times out of ten it's cheap got it now that you know about fiber and fabric construction and fit seams and stitching what is your final answer one if the mystery shirt is cheap or expensive hmm I think if we're looking at all of those factors especially this pull test that you're just giving me right now I'm gonna go with expensive for the big reveal okay let's see 122 expensive yeah that's expensive why do you think that is so based on what we learned today as far as fiber and fabrication when would you do the pull test yeah it does not hold the wrinkle which means that this is probably prima cotton as far as the construction of fit aesthetically you can't really go based on the fit because it's a boxy shirt but as far as the construction you have so many elements here double seams all around the neckline double stitching here you have a peplum so it lets me know that it's constructed well this sure is expensive so good job also thank you so much for helping us today I'm going to be absolutely texting you the next time I go teacher shopping yes definitely I'm one text away [Music]", "wPYQAomgG9k": "hey guys it's Kayla from noted arts I run a small t-shirt company right now it's small I'm sure it'll be bigger soon and I make sure it's like the one I'm wearing which is it says blonde on it a cool message and I like it and like this one which we'll be talking about in a second the reason I'm bringing up shirts is because most people are searching for how to find the vintage field shirt or how to create the vintage field shirt on on shirts they have at their house already for stuff that they can find around their house and if you search online like I did over and over again you come across this recipe that says salt water and even baking soda sometimes mixed with water put the shirt in it make it sit and let it sit for three days and then come back and you wash it and it's great and it's good to go in it's perfectly vintage and comfortable and song that is false completely false okay the only thing it did accomplish from what I saw and I tried it a few times with different variations of the recipe same result it does fade color so if you are trying to fade out a dark color that's a good way to do it but it doesn't make it softer and in fact I think a lot of people are saying it makes it a little bit more stark to your rough on the skin so I did my own little research and I found a simple way to do it and it's really good okay so what you're gonna need is a shirt like the one I have here okay now you have to remember certain types of certain are only gonna get a certain measure of softness and vintage feel okay so if you have a hundred percent heavy-duty cotton shirt it's only gonna get so vintage okay or so soft because it it's simply a thick heavy shirt so it if you start out with a good brand then it's gonna get even better okay so what you're gonna need is a pumice stone or a pumice stone this could be found at a lot of stores in the beauty section for like four to six bucks I think and it's well worth it because I've used it a lot and it hasn't even degraded at all really a cool little tool there for what we're gonna use it for and then you have fabric softener which is also four to six bucks I think and I did Google this and ultra downy is actually you want to stick with ultra or whatever it is but ultra downy is actually one of the most effective brands of fabric softener and then surprisingly enough you're gonna want some tennis balls brand new tennis balls don't get used tennis balls I prefer about six maybe more of you if you're doing a lot of shirts okay so the process is you're gonna take the pumice stone first the first step and you're gonna lay your shirt down on the floor on a table and pin it down somehow on all fours or some other method and literally sand your entire shirt okay and starting from the shoulder all the way down and you're gonna probably want to spin this is including the sleeves okay very important even the collar on the collar send it up a little bit it what it does is it's gonna break the fabric up a little bit so that when you do put it in the solution later it'll be more effective okay and it's very soft on the skin when you're done all right so you're gonna sand it up and like I said two or three minutes after you do each side turn the shirt inside out so that it's soft on the inside too okay and do the whole the whole shirt should probably take you seven to eight minutes to do you thorough beat be firm and just do the whole shirt thoroughly and once you're done you're gonna take it and put it into the solution the measurement of this solution is one cup of water to one cup of fabric softener for one shirt tank I guess I should have done one for each of those anyway so you're gonna put that in your tray or bucket and let it sit for 24 hours that's what I've been doing and it turns out great I'm sure if you leave it in longer it's even better maybe a little less I don't think it even matters that much but definitely several hours okay when you're done rinse the shirt out thoroughly okay because it's gonna smell strongly of your fabric softener which is a strong smelling agent then you're gonna take it to the washing machine and wash it again now wash it probably with no soap but if you need so fun but wash it when you're done watching it this is where the tennis balls come in okay I'm gonna take the tennis balls and put them in the dryer with the shirt the reason for this is it's gonna act kind of like the pumice stone did and it's going to be abrasive on the shirt and add that little bit of breaking down to the fabric so that when you do wear it it's gonna feel amazing okay so dry your shirt remember one thing though this is goes for washing and drying when you do high heat it tends to shrink the shirt a little bit sometimes it doesn't last very long but definitely immediately once you put it on it will shrink the shirt so just make sure you wash and consider that little tidbit of information so that's basically how you create a vintage feel shirt from a shirt that you own in your house now out of materials you can grab its view on a DIY and I hope that's helpful once again if you like the shirt I'm wearing or the shirt I showed you earlier go ahead and check out noted art dot weebly.com and maybe you can get a shirt that I made and I do this to all shirts but either way thank you for watching and pee", "7g27zU0bXnA": "I want to show you how to make a t-shirt facemask this is a design I came up with after looking at a lot of different patterns it has a drawstring as its main feature and ties in the back with like a little Slipknot so it's adjustable and we'll go over your ears and you can bunt it up or unbutton it to get a really good fit on your face I have two sizes this is based on other guidance I found on other face masks and so the finished size of the adult is about five by eight and a half child four by seven and a half what you need is a t-shirt that you're going to cut up and a sewing machine and thread you need a safety pin to help you put this cord into the casings and a chopstick might be helpful when we're turning the corners inside out and also putting into the key scenes if you're if they're clogged with the seam allowance or something to get them open seeking cord through so step one is you want to cut your fabric and so for the t-shirt I tried you really want to cut it with the long way of this fabric going up the t-shirt I tried it the other direction in it and it works fine enough this is the other direction and it kind of made the top a little bit wonky and didn't quite fit as nicely over the front if you have it stretch this way which is the direction the fabric stretching up and down rather than across the face you get a better fit so I recommend cutting it long ways with a t-shirt direction going that way for this is for the adult you want six and a half I mean six wide by eighteen inches long for a child would be five inches by 16 inches long the way that I cut this was I actually just took a little nip where I wanted them to start and end my six inches so I measured six inches out into the clip you can actually just tear hold this down here tear your fabric you can get a nice hair along the grain of the fabric and so it will be nice and even and not skewed one way or another this is also the same method that you need to do in order to make the drawstring later so you get your fabric the right dimensions and then you want to fold it in half with the right sides together and the wrong sides out for t-shirt fabric you can tell that because the wrong side it curls towards the wrong side so this is step 2 so it's folded in half this is the fold side and what you want to do is you want to sew along the edges here but you want to leave 1/2 edge gaps here here and here that become the openings for the casing so on this folded edge I actually started sewing I back stitched about a half inch away from that fold and then a seam allowance is about a quarter of an inch you can make a little bit more if you want like 3/8 all the way up to here and then this by back stitch right here about a half inch away from the seams where the seam is going to start again and I just moved my machine so this is not sewn it's open there jumped it over back stitched here went down this side backstitch tear jumped again another half inch again this is not sewn here it's just the thread where I jumped and then sewed and then you want to leave a couple inches here at the edge to turn this inside out so leave that opening so in step three turn everything inside out and you're going to want to press it so here's that opening that I used to turn I want to press those seam allowances down make those nice and straight press these up and this is where you can use your chopstick to get the nice corners in like that to turn it nicely and then press step four you want to sew again this is to sit on the edges and to make the drawstring cases so I started up here at the top back stitch and I sewed really close to the edge here about an eighth of an inch all the way over here and then I stopped about a half inch from the seam again this is where that opening is at the top and the bottom so a half inch away from the edge to make my casing then came down here real close so at eighth of an inch of the edge again and then that will help close off that opening that we had down here before this helps that edge stitching helps close that off and then I go up a half an inch away and then back stitch here so now I've got casing here and this is sewn down and that openings closed the last step is to make the cord so I showed you how to cut that cord you want a you know a long piece when you stretch this after you cut it it'll get longer so I think mine at least 40 inches now just play around with size to see if will fit you or someone that there but you want it I would say no more than an inch when you cut it or about an inch but you want it to be strong enough so it won't break but not too thick that you can't fit it through the K seams so you're going to want to insert it at the bottom and go at the top and then come out here and again use a safety pin just pin that through it and then go in and go out and then when you're done just not off the end maybe double knot them so they don't come through these are intended for people with like patients the vulnerable populations patients nursing home homeless I'm not intending these to work for healthcare workers I really hope that they get the actual medical grade surgical masks but if there's other vulnerable populations that you know of please make these and donate to them wash them and sanitary before you give it to anybody or make sure that if you're dropping off at a hospital somewhere or place they plan to wash them cotton is really good about that again these are cotton t-shirts just old t-shirts that I use hopefully if you have those around so again make these donate these if you're healthy don't have symptoms you don't need to wear these but there are lots of people out there who are vulnerable and hopefully our health care workers will get what they need but they might need them too so just make these donate these if you have any other questions please let me know or any other ideas of how to make these but I was trying to make something that people have lots of material and we all have t-shirts I've got tons of them so thank you so much if you've any questions please let me know stay safe stay well stay busy and stay positive thank you so much bye-bye", "3tKLnKV9h70": "it's time for today's doctor's prescription because we've all done it maybe you have this brand new shirt you love it but you wear it throw it in the washer and dryer you take it out and now it's too small well we heard about a really cool trick to unshrink your clothes and our staff tried it out and it worked here's what you do you fill up a bucket of warm water with baby shampoo let that article of clothing soak for about 30 minutes then you remove it wring out the excess water and stretch it back to the original shape then you let it dry flat on a dry towel what's cool is the baby shampoo helps by making that clothing soft it relaxes those fibers so you can stretch it out easily to have a long you want it we're going to have a how-to on our website but whoa mister said they were able to add an inch and a half or so back to the length of the leg yeah I I think it's good for that but I wonder how it holds the garments shape do you think it depends on the piece of clothing it seems like a perfect thing for jeans yes but I think when it comes to a shirt or something that needs a perfect shape I'm not sure how it would know to go back to the exact shape yeah you just never washed those if you're sure and therein lies the problem with men yes indeed yes indeed for being with us we really appreciate it thank you all for tuning in if you missed anything head to the doctors tv.com we'll see you", "AXCh6rW2LbY": "in this short video we will show you our transfer paper for t-shirts it comes in a very simple plastic sleeve and some everything you need is inside transfer paper is used with an ordinary inkjet printer using ordinary inks everything you need is in the pack despite the fact that it's we refer to it as a budget transfer paper this is a very high quality product the reason it's referred to as budget is that we strip away all the packaging from it and any fancy paraphernalia all you get the whole price most of the price that you pay is for the paper itself inside the pack you have the paper that looks like this the red grid obviously tells you where not to print this is the printing surface once you have an image and it can be anything can be photographs can be graphics can be logos it can be anything your imagination or your requirement dictates once you have the paper and an ordinary injured printer with ordinary inks you need to print an image on it on this occasion we've got a silly little silly little dinosaur but anything any image that you can imagine will work once you have your image printed and you notice that we've printed it in mirror mode the reason for it will become apparent but you must be able to print your image in Reverse it doesn't much matter if it's just the graphic but if you've got text in it it's essential that you print it in the mirror once you have the paper ready and printed we can move this printer away to one side what you will need is a suitable ironing surface suitable ironing surface means something that will not be damaged when you apply heat to it so I'm going to put just a cutting board a piece of wood anything anything strong and solid you notice that I'm not doing it on a an ironing board you should not should not do the transfer on an ironing board because you won't be able to apply the correct pressure onto it so once you have your paper ready and your ironing surface what I'm going to do is just put a t-shirt on top just to just to cushion the surface a little bit just to protect it a little bit more and give it a bit of a gift and the t-shirt itself this is the t-shirt where you're going to actually print on I'm going to give it a bit of an iron this is you just smooth out any creases I'll take this opportunity to talk about the iron I'm using a very high-quality iron here but it has to be it has to be an iron that is over about 1200 watts although this is a steam iron will switch to steam off so we're not going to use the steam on it at all and it's set to maximum temperature once everything is ready um and again you can do this at any time you can do this a day before there's no done up to particularly that's sometimes sensitive what we're doing now I'm going to cut out any of the white areas which are not part of the image I'm going to do it quite roughly you can be as careful as you want but it's best to leave as little as possible about three or four millimeters around the image the film will not really be visible but it will the more you leave the more it will be apparent so you can see I'm doing it really quickly showing it to you in real time just to show you how easy this is and how little expertise is required to from nothing to create quite a funny t-shirt personalize something special something specific to an event or a logo or pretty much anything you imagination dictates so remember we had with printless in mirror mode there's the mirror debit text and we're not placing it we're going to place it face down onto the shirt so the orange or the red the squares are visible we pre eye onto the shirt we've preheated our iron this has been heating up for about five minutes at maximum temperature this is a 1400 watt iron we've turned off the steam and now all we have to do is apply the heat and putting quite a lot of pressure on this iron pressure is important as well as the time we take to I run an image like this we're looking at about 30 seconds if you're doing a full a 4 image it takes about a minute but it is a minute on each part of the of the image so you notice I'm making sure that I cover every single part of the image with heat I'm leaning on the iron pressure is very important a lot of mistakes are made by just ironing it with a couple of fingers you will actually transfer the image but it won't be durable unless you you use some elbow grease some weight over it don't need to break the iron but a firm firm pressure on a flat firm surface is essential if you're doing it on a on an ironing board it will not work because the ironing board has got some gaps in it normally has a mesh underneath and you can't really put pressure on it it will it will give a bit so this is about ready about 30 seconds and we will now let it cool down so will that cool this down to room temperature probably about five minutes you can't speed it up by putting it on on a piece of metal but it has to be at room temperature give it a little bit of stretch and peel away if you make a mistake like this not a problem if you have a tear in it if it is midway through peeling just pick pick off the corner and carry on this can be done at any times no not critical if you can't wait too long with this you can do the day later so once we peeled off no ink has been left on - on our transfer paper the hole of the ink and the film has transferred on to the t-shirt and now just to give it a little bit more longevity and washability we need to fix the image and the image is fixed with a silicone paper once you transfer the image we need to finish it there's another little quick stage that we have to carry out to give it a little bit more strength and longevity in the washing machine and this is done with a reusable silicon paper which is supplied in the pack so the pack contains everything you need this is a like a parchment a bit like a grease proof paper so it has a silicon coating to prevent anything sticking to it we put it back on the exposed image back with the same iron we haven't switched it off we're giving it about 20 seconds of heat again again the instructions are very very clear with the tongues and the sizes pressure is again important give it a bit of elbow grease to push the image even further into the t-shirt and you peel it hopped again don't panic about it it's sitting on paper you see not no image no ink has gone on top this silicon sheets is reusable you can see that no ink has come on to it with the after weary iron so you can use that again and again for the amount of transfer paper that you've got in the pack and the transfer paper they transfer itself the image is ready on the shirt and is now finished this can be washed in a washing machine at 40 degrees with a full spin cycle don't do it as a delicate wash don't leave it to soak in the first wash and anytime behind anytime after use it just like it wash it like any other t-shirt and all you hit all you need is in the back to silicon paper to finish and a backup transfer paper", "a-JPA3d-DtY": "what's up YouTube back again with another new video now for the past 2 or 3 weeks on my Instagram live I've been teasing this video idea and since then a lot of you have DM me like yo is that video coming out when's that video coming out and here it finally is Street where brands that use the illusion now this is not gonna be the roast session that I know a lot of you want but don't worry I do have a video that will be a little more critical coming out within the next month or two so be sure to stay tuned for that and basically where we should start this video is saying what Gildan is now Gilda is a clothing manufacturer based out of Canada that produces blanks so you got your blank tees blank hoodies crewneck sweatshirt etc etc kind of similar to like a Hanes Fruit of the Loom American Apparel but I wouldn't necessarily say that Gildan is completely bottom-of-the-barrel low tier in terms of quality but I also wouldn't put them at the top upper scale either but the big kind of thing with it is that they're really cheap in terms of pricing I think it's a dollar 20 to a dollar 45 per blank t-shirt and there are a lot of street wear brands that are really popular right now that have been using Gildan blanks and there is nothing wrong with that but when you look at their profit margins and like the way they price things you would swear that they're selling you something of an amazing quality when instead you're kind of just getting a lackluster basic product and obviously there are some people who are aware of this and don't care because - like cool hype I just want it - I don't care but there are other people who I noticed were not aware of this and they're like - yo what the hell is this I paid $200 for this and it feels like [ __ ] and that is not a knock - Gildan and it's not a direct knock necessarily at the brand either because I do know some brands are gonna be like well well we think our name is worth this motion therefore we shall charge this much but where the problem lies is some of these brands claim to be all about the youth and the culture of street wear but how are you all about the youth and the culture of street wear when you're kind of like putting out a free [ __ ] product in my opinion like you're using a $1 t-shirt right with the most generic basic logo screen-printed on and you're gonna charge another 149 dollars or more for that tee I just don't see the logic in that and I think that's where the main fault is is a lot of these individuals just they spew out all this [ __ ] like they're all about the kids and they're all about you know street wear in general but in reality it just seems like they're all about making a quick buck and never sending out your products so we're gonna start off with the first brand that comes to mind and it is anti-social social club often refer to as anti guild and Gildan Club or anti shipping shipping Club because a lot of people never get their [ __ ] now I totally understand when you start from humble beginnings you got to use something cheap because maybe you don't have the capital to start off printing your your design on a higher quality shirt but anti-social social club is pretty big now and to my knowledge a lot of people who are still buying this stuff tell me that it still feels like the Gildan stuff that they were selling a year or two ago and I mean I don't know maybe it's just the hype maybe people really like me but I personally can't justify that and I would like to tell people like I'm not trying to knock on anybody's hustle but if you're not sending your shirts out like you're already selling a pretty low-tier product with a pretty generic logo but if you're not even sending your product out as you can see all over the internet people are saying that antisocial social club doesn't even send their [ __ ] like the shipping is horrible the customer service is horrible so I guess the customer service is essentially antisocial maybe maybe that's like the whole stick with it but I just don't get it and I just think that's really bad on them because people I've seen people comment on their Instagram pages like yo how are you driving a McLaren but you can't ship out t-shirts to people so I don't know but if any of you thought that antisocial social club was something of like a high quality I would say it's not I've felt some of the stuff in hands and although I do say that their t-shirts are kind of not horribly priced I think they're 30 to 40 dollars and when you compare that to some of the other [ __ ] on this list that sounds like a downright bargain but when you consider that you're probably not going to get your shirt in the mail maybe it's not a bargain but anyway moving onto the next brand we have the pablo merch and what what else can I say the Pablo March essentially to emerge so I guess you can cut it a bit more slack because it's not like some dedicated brand for the most part and they sell their shirts for I believe forty to fifty dollars as well and it depends also with the hoodies and the long sleeve which are also gilding as far as I know and I don't know like I get it like in the past Kanye's used on hands beefy T's for watching the throne those were only like 40 dollars and there was more design element to them and I just don't want anyone to be fooled like oh I'm paying $300 resale for this stuff so it must be good no you're paying for high you're literally paying for high it's a one dollar t-shirt bro like don't get it twisted all that [ __ ] on [ __ ] on Aliexpress or eBay that people are like just printing their own [ __ ] it's about as close to real as the other [ __ ] because like I said it's just gilding tea with some pretty basic screen print it's really easy to replicate and although I'm not condoning making a replica if they're both killed in its kind of the same [ __ ] right anyway moving on to the next one which is V alone now a lot of people have been really mad with this because I guess they weren't originally aware and there are the alone shirts that can cost up to one hundred and fifty dollars and I've had a source tell me that the camo shirts are Rothko and the black teas are Gildan and then someone took a picture and put it on Instagram of one of the V lone pop-ups where there's a bunch of Gildan boxes like right behind the cashier or something we're just pretty [ __ ] hilarious now I know they can't prove that the V lone T's were on Gildan for the most part but based on what I've seen calcium in person I'm pretty sure those are Gildan blanks ID I know for sure the camo [ __ ] that they sell is Rothko which also is not really that expensive of a brand but hey I mean I guess profit margins are more important than the culture and next moving on to one that actually caught me by surprise now I do have to note though this is fear of God but fear of God does not use guilt in for all their stuff they do have the majority of this stuff is cut and so but there's a few capsule collections like I think it was like a LA or like a Celtics or some type of [ __ ] shirt as well as these other ones that have like Bible verses or something and apparently those shirts were several hundred dollars but they were gilded tees so I don't really understand like Jerry Lorenzo kind of portrays themselves as being more high-end but I'm sorry no high-end designer would ever use a one dollar one it's not even a five dollar blank like come on like it would be cutting so and I just think that's kind of [ __ ] because a lot of people think I'm paying this much this must be a great high quality item or maybe some people know oh I'm just paying for the name but when you have a lot of these designers or like these friends of rappers etc claiming to kind of be on that like Gucci level or just like on a higher level of design but they're selling you stuff like this because when they really did care about you or like their fans in general wouldn't they want to put out the absolute best product they possibly could especially when you consider everybody I just named like all these brands or all these artists or designers or like rappers whatever they all are rich now so even if from humble beginnings they had to use lower-tier blanks to kind of get their brand rolling they're all rich now they could up the quality easily but no like they don't want to [ __ ] up their profit margins so I don't know I just it puts a bad taste in my mouth knowing that there's a lot of these people that make all these claims that they're totally a hundred percent about the culture yet they do stuff like this so it kind of shows just because something is expensive does not mean that it is of a high quality and like I said before this is not a knock on their hustle but it is a knock on some of their ethics and some of the [ __ ] they spew on social media like don't believe just because they tell you their about this or their about that that's actually the truth like actually look behind the scenes sometimes and realize that these people don't give a [ __ ] about you for the most part and no this is not a knock on Jerry I'm not trying to go out anybody right now I don't want anybody to get this twisted but come on man like in general all of you have the ability to make something better but Niek in particular send your [ __ ] out bro like you're whipping MacLaren's and Ferraris like okay it's turning into a [ __ ] round now but yeah do like send your [ __ ] out to people get better customer service instead of buying all these [ __ ] cars and [ __ ] or at least just admit that your [ __ ] is [ __ ] like your customer service is complete [ __ ] but yeah anyway I don't [ __ ] with these brands anyway so I guess it doesn't really matter but I just want to let a lot of the younger kids know that a lot of shifts low-key not with the [ __ ] so yeah thank you so much for watching sorry it broke out into a bit of a rant but the real rents are coming pretty soon so make sure to stay tuned for those and yeah thank you so much for watching make sure to follow me on Instagram to keep up with the livestreams and peace out YouTube [Music]",

in sales but I'm also gonna lay out for you my step by step how to get started our merch guide so that YouTube can get up to $100 a day now keep in mind when I'm laying this out it doesn't mean you're gonna make that hundred dollars a day ASAP anyone that tells you that is full of crap and I'm gonna instead show you how with some work and with some effort over a period of time you will to be able to make eight hundred dollars a day and you're gonna see how this shirt just crushed it for me now these are all based on my experiences and I'm gonna show you some of the key things that you can do to get started that way you can make money in twenty twenty specifically designing your own t-shirt so let's go ahead and jump into my screen share and I'll show you the best way to get started making money with t-shirts so the first thing to understand is I'm gonna be showing you using Amazon merch now there are several other ways that you can actually get started making money with t-shirts there's stuff like facebook there's stuff like Pinterest and there's all sorts of ways that you can make money but I'm specifically going to be talking about merch so what are the advantages of merch well it's pretty simple merch is a platform where you can create t-shirt designs and then they get sold on Amazon which means you get to use all of amazon's customers which have their credit cards on file and in exchange amazon will pay you a royalty fee for selling your actual t-shirt on amazon so how much do you get paid well it really depends on the price of your t-shirt so keep that in mind a lot of people prefer to go with a lower price that way they make money just dollars here dollars there but there's a lot of people that put a lot of effort into it so they pick a higher price and really at the end of day it's all up to you and it also depends on what promotional method you're going to try now there's really two big promotional methods the first one is making it a game of numbers what I mean by that is just listing as many t-shirts as possible that's sort of the play that I took now keep in mind I did try the other that witches running ads or doing promotions to the other method that involves a little bit more money and it's pretty much a guessing game so I prefer to do the game of numbers however if you want to learn the promotional method well you are going to need to learn Facebook Ads so that just requires a little bit more time and effort to learn how to actually run ads to your t-shirts but let's go ahead and jump in and look at the very first step that you're going to need to take in order to use the merch platform okay so the very first step is to request an invitation when you do that you're going to have to create your Amazon account you can use an existing one I would prefer to create a new one and then use that specifically just for merch and not anything else once you request the invitation it could take merch anywhere from a couple days to a couple weeks to accept you but once you get accepted then you're all ready to go so that brings us to step two now with step to that is researching selling t-shirts so what we're gonna use is a strategy of taking t-shirts that are already out there that are making money and then trying to make them better or put putting a spin on the design ourselves so let's take a look at this and start looking at a couple different places we can research t-shirts the very first one obviously is going to be amazon.com and what we can just do here is type in t-shirt and see what pops up at the end of it a lot of times it'll tell us what's actually hot like t-shirts for men funny sayings um see what else let's click on that and see what pops up t-shirts for men saying like having something like I don't need Google my wife knows everything might be against some people's Terms of Service I don't know if you can use Google on their free words of wisdom like again this somebody that is actually putting Yoda so that's probably not a good idea he's sorry I'm late I didn't want to come something like that is pretty good to do like it's I've got an actual shirt now I'm even gonna show you guys these shirt that says people not a big fan and that shirt has sold hundreds and hundreds possibly even close to a thousand t-shirts and all it says is people not a big fan so at the end of the day our goal is to go through here and get as many ideas as we can see that are selling and then try and figure out okay can I make this like duct tape can't fix stupid this is a decent one it's kind of like hi with the BS are you want some some t-shirts with a lower B s are like this is a really good one if you met my family you'd understand and it's 17,000 and clothing which means it's probably selling pretty hot so this is a perfect example of one we could copy and maybe change the text and the font I flexed and the sleeves fell off here's another good idea of 120 900 in clothing this can also give you your own ideas let's say for example that you kind of have some funny things that people think are funny that you say this is the perfect chance to say that kind of crap and put it on a t-shirt right this is your chance to prove that you're funny like I found this humorous I don't find that humorous at all but obviously a lot of people do because this thing is 77,000 in clothing looking at my wife I think damn she is a lucky woman that's a perfect example of a good freaking t-shirt so again 136,000 and clothing think about how you could make that better with font or something else and we'll talk a little bit more about designs here in a second now the second way you can find really cool designs is by going to a site called Juanillo comm this is a huge site with all the Shopify guys I'm just gonna sign into here so you guys can take a look and see why I like to use it and what you can just see here is like look at this 1900 saves means that it's pretty freakin popular right now we rhinoceros is just a fat unicorn that's a perfect example of something that you could actually put on Amazon so let's take a look at that a rhinoceros is just a fat unicorn [Music] nobody really has it they have it on a mug but that's about it but this 353,000 in kitchen and dining which is not gonna like really to a freaking house at the end of the year anything but it certainly can sell a couple hundred which a couple hundred added with another couple hundred I can be a good thing so that's just an example of one like there's some of these that have a massive amount of shares Feliz Navidad 3400 I stole her heart so I'm stealing his last I don't know name 4,600 I thought it said last so and I was like that's a that's a damn gold digger right there if I've ever seen one let's see what else leave your worries and your shoes at the door this one hour means I love you in dinosaur not that many saves but you can really just look through here and find ones with a massive amount of saves and then use them for your ideas nerd I prefer the term intellectual badass that doesn't look like it's selling that well but anyways people I want to punch in the face 15900 it's almost like a checklist you could just do a checklist like you can produce something like people I want to punch in the face and then hit lead a little checklist a checkoff box and put my mother-in-law how people might buy that kind of crap so that's already give you guys a freaking example that I know will sell like hotcakes people want to punch in the face my mother-in-law perfect alright so let's go to the third and final way to figure this out that is by using a site by the name of merchants former so I'm gonna log in this is a paid site so you will have to pay a registration fee to actually join this but let me show you why this is super cool it's got a feature in there called merge hunter I'm gonna click in a merge hunter and I'm just gonna straight-up tell merge hunter that I want it to tell me the top 100 best sellers I can even pick more than that I could pick the top 500 and then I can hit search I want to merge by Amazon t-shirts and I want the US market place and I'm just gonna let it come back to me in 36 seconds and tell me what's hot right now and obviously baby Yoda is red hot like who doesn't like whoever doesn't like baby I don't understand who could not like baby Yoda right if you you know like baby odor if you don't think he's cute then there's a problem with you that's it don't watch this video if you know like being Yoda but anyways trump trump is a perfect thing here is an example of one that you can actually do your own design I do what I want it's a freaking cat flipping people off pretty simple to do and to copy that design pew-pew pew-pew pew-pew that's pretty piu e resting pit face there's a lot of a lot of stuff that you can really knock off here a lot of stuff with just words my perfect day and here's a perfect day and there's a reason I keep stressing the words thing and we're gonna learn about that in the next step but already gotten a quite a few ideas that are pretty fairly easy to make and do so let's get into the next step and that step is getting our design mate now I'm gonna show you the absolute most bootstrap method which means it's cheap AF right and then I'm going to show you the higher versions of this method so the first version is go to youtube and google how to how to use photoshop right or even better than that there's another thing called and I can't even spell photo poop I can't even spell it right but there are a ton of tutorials that will show you how to use it so at least you can get good enough to be able to duplicate some of these words right you can do the words ones your stuff so that's the absolute most boostrap method the next thing that you could do if you don't want to do that and you actually want to invest some money instead of some time is go to Fiverr and search t-shirt design and on Fiverr you can find guys that can do your t-shirt for a very little amount of money this one here is starting at 50 which is kind of high like he's the one that's actually figuring out the design I would design a t-shirt and merchandise graphics for 5 bucks these are the guys that I'm talking about look for the five dollar guys and then show them the t-shirt that you want to design and what you want to do different on it and they'll do it so that's a second method where you can use $5 now the third method which is the method that I use is I went to a site by the name of online jobs pH and I hired what's called a virtual assistant I posted a job I hired a virtual assistant there's all sorts of virtual assistants out there they can do things like design t-shirts right so I'm going to put t-shirt and you were to see a bunch of their resumes pop up and now you can read through the resumes you can also see what they want to get paid so I basically posted a job and I offer to pay a t-shirt designer $300 for a full-time job 40 hours a week designing t-shirts not stop that's how I went about it you can see that some of these people have $100 required amount to start designing t-shirts and they can work $10 10 hours a week there's a lot of people that are from a hundred all the way on up to even a thousand dollars you can get some very good people here on the site this is where I've hired all the phenol Filipino v---aids that I have and so you can get a really good deal by hiring somebody here to design your t-shirts and of course like I said before you don't have to start with the 300 like I did you could start very low that was somebody that popped up here for $100 a month for 10 hours a week that's pretty darn good you can get them to design t-shirts for 10 hours a week and again go with the game of numbers you can do yourself the tax version ones and you could have them do the ones that require photos so that's the third way that you can actually get these t-shirts designed because the next and final step is how do you promote your t-shirts now remember I told you there are two ways to do this the first way is just playing the game on numbers meaning the more shirts you can actually post on there the better and I'll show you what I mean I actually stopped selling on merch in 2017 in 2017 I hit as much as $10,000 in a single month selling merch and then I just found out it wasn't for me now the reasons it wasn't for me is because I find that when I managed Filipino workers it just doesn't work out well and they end up not doing a lot of anything and to truth be told I really wasn't good at giving them brand new designs so the last few that I made a significant amount of money on merch was 2017 since then not a single design has been made not a single finger has been lifted but yet I still get paid every single month from Amazon on my multiple merch accounts now take a look at one now this is just one merch account where I did pretty decent on a t-shirt that was made way back when now I'm even gonna reveal to you the t-shirt I'm inside one of my merch accounts and you notice that during 11 1 20 19 to 11:30 2019 I'll refresh it again and again so you guys can see this is legit what freaking happened and you'll see I'm on amazon.com I've never even looked at UK I've never even looked at Dee because again I hardly ever even logged in here and what you're gonna see right here is there's a t-shirt called a turkey face pink bow t-shirt kids Thanksgiving gift I click on that take a look at this and here is the design this shirt crushed it for Thanksgiving 526 purchased and seven thousand seven hundred sixty-four dollars made in revenue and obviously I wasn't selling it for a very high price let's take a look at what it was I don't even remember $14.99 which is really freaking cheap I still made 10 percent which is 732 dollars in cash so this month alone on this account was over $750 and every single month it brings in quite a bit as well as the other ones so every single month I passively and have an income since 2017 since we quit this so for the past two years passive income and sometimes I get a super sweet bonus like that turkey shirt so boom there you have it that's exactly how you can make money with the game of numbers however if you want to do it super bold like we were doing it at one point and we got it to the 10k then you're gonna have to learn how to do extra promotion that promotion can be done through Facebook through Instagram through Pinterest any one of those things and that's beyond the scope of this video if you are interested in me teaching our Facebook method though put a put an actual comment below subscribe to the channel and I will definitely think about it I will show you how we actually do giveaways and rank products through our Facebook funnels if that interests you let me know post a comment and tell me how you like this video other than that merch it's still a fantastic business option if you're willing to put in the work and the effort to make money on merch it can still work for you take a look at me two years later and I'm still collecting a passive check for merch without lifting a single finger I'll see you guys in the next video [Music]", "-fIXaDeYpjY": "hello this is a shirt works progra view for a Guilder and heavy cotton tee gto 585 grams that comes in a variety of cotton poly mixes depending on color and most of them are are under percent cotton but you need to make sure if you've got a preference you look at the colors and the information next to each one this comes in a whopping 48 colors which is a big selling feature for this includes antique colors and heather colors it's not quite as smooth as the soft style teachers from Giro down but a beautiful quality to wait to price ratio neck is a little bit thicker in the rib arms or world proportions the body is snug but not too tight the length is a little bit too much for me but I am assure us I'll show you what it looks like in a large okay so we've got up a size and as you can see it's quite a leap in size okay personally this one is too big for me I prefer my shirts to be a little bit better fitted so a medium size guide and with this particular product from Gilda I personally would buy a medium sized shirt", "EeGeAgZM7OQ": "what's going on guys in this video i'm going to show you all the different ways you can make t-shirts for your t-shirt business let's begin alright guys so we're going to talk about all the different ways you can make t-shirts we will talk about direct garment screen printing how to make t-shirts with a vinyl cutter how to make t-shirts the professional laser printer we will talk about budget ways to make t-shirts and print on demand we will also break down the complete process and talk about the pros and cons of each before we get into all of that let's talk about how to buy blank t-shirts and the different types of shirts you can buy there's going to be many websites where you guys can buy wholesale t-shirt blings in this example we're going to use jiffy shirts.com just so you guys know you don't need any kind of business license anyone can purchase from these sites these sites will sell t-shirts anywhere from one dollar and fifty cents all the way up to around eight dollars if you guys are going to be selling cheap t-shirts on ebay you can go with something like the gildan g500 t-shirt these start at around 1.50 but if you guys are gonna be selling high-end t-shirts for your fashion brand it's better to go with something like a bella canvas or an american apparel shirt these are more expensive also just so you guys know white t-shirts will always be the cheapest if you're getting black or colored t-shirts they will be more expensive if you guys are starting a high-end streetwear company in my opinion one of the best shirts you can buy is the american apparel 2001 shirt now if you guys buy this t-shirt be very careful they have a cheap version of it which is called the 2001w this is a horrible quality t-shirt don't buy it it's nothing like the regular 2001 that's made in the us t-shirts will also come in different styles regular t-shirts and fashion t-shirts regular t-shirts will usually have longer sleeves and the more loose fit whereas fashion t-shirts have a short sleeve and more of a european fit a shirt like the gildan g500 is going to be made out of regular cotton and is going to have more of a cardboard feel to it whereas a t-shirt like a bella canvas or an american apparel is going to be made out of ring-spun cotton which means the shirt is going to be much more higher quality and it's going to be much softer all right guys let's talk about the different ways to make t-shirts just so you guys know no matter which method you choose you will need a heat press machine and i'll leave a link in description the first way to make t-shirts is dtg printing which stands for direct to garment printing this means the blank t-shirt is inserted into the printer and the printer prints directly onto the shirt this is great for one-off prints or if you're making t-shirts with pictures these printers usually cost over ten thousand dollars and one of the best printers is the epson f2100 this is industry standard the good thing about these printers is that you don't have to purchase them outright you can always finance them for around 300 a month just so you guys know websites that make custom t-shirts like printful and teespring they all use dtg printers these printers print extremely high quality and the image will not wash away or fade you can also make black t-shirts without a problem the printers also print in white color so you can make black t-shirts if you're printing a black t-shirt you will print the white ink first and then the printer will print the colors on top each shirt will cost around two dollars to print if you use factory epson inks before you print on the shirt you will also have to spray it with a pre-treating liquid this will make the colors very bright and will also protect the shirt you will then heat press the shirt and the shirt is ready if you guys do buy a dtg printer i really suggest you get a real professional heat press which costs around a thousand dollars so let's talk about the pros and cons of dtg printing the pros are prince professional quality t-shirts very high detail it's very easy to set up and print it's very fast to print you can make black t-shirts with white ink the cost to print is very cheap and you can make one-off t-shirts the cons or if you have bad credit is going to be expensive next let's talk about screen printing screen printing is the oldest way to make t-shirts it's also the most popular way screen printing is the cheapest way to make shirts if you're mass producing one shirt let's talk about how screen printing works screen printing is not for when you're making just one shirt like dtg it's for mass producing one t-shirt first you will need to buy the screen printing machine if you guys don't plan to open up a print shop you don't have to buy a huge one you can buy a small one you can get the machine for a couple hundred dollars you will also need to buy a large format inkjet printer you will need to buy transparent film screens frames a uv light machine and inks the way screen printing works is that you will have to make a screen and frame for each color that's on the t-shirt so if your shirt has four colors you will have to make four screens and frames the first thing you will do is divide the image by color in photoshop and then you will make a screen for each color layer you will buy transparent film and then print each layer separately on your inkjet printer using black color you will also print registration marks on each sheet so that you can align perfectly you will then buy emulsion you will take your screen put a motion on the screen put the film on the uv machine and put the screen on top of it you will expose the screen to uv light for a few minutes the printed parts that did not hit the uv light will then become very fragile and you can easily wash them away with the water hose you will then put the screens onto the screen printing machine and you will use a squeegee and apply ink to every shirt if you guys have a large screen printing machine you can make a lot of t-shirts very fast inks for screen printing are extremely cheap so it's very cheap to make t-shirts the cool thing about screen printing t-shirts is that you guys can also do all kinds of metal colors metal colors such as gold and you can also make fall t-shirts so instead of ink you can use glue and then apply foil and make metallic shirts you guys can also add rhinestones if you want to make rhinestone t-shirts let's talk about the pros and cons of screen printing the pros are you can start a professional t-shirt business with around 1 000 the quality of the t-shirts is going to be great and they will withstand a lot of watches the cost to make a t-shirt is extremely cheap and you can also make all kinds of cool t-shirts like foil the cons are if you plan to make just one t-shirt it won't make sense because the startup time and cost is just not worth it which leads to the next con and that is that it takes a long time to set everything up also screen printing can take up a lot of space and can be a messy process also unlike dtg printing which requires a digital file you have to store your screen somewhere and that takes up space now let's talk about one more thing that can be done with screen printing which is kind of cool and that's plastisol transfer sheets what a plastisol transfer is is basically a screen print that's printed on either a clear film or a white piece of paper and then sent to you and you could heat press it onto your shirt so you don't have to actually do any of the work the only thing that you need is a heat press machine and you're good to go there are a lot of companies that provide this type of service and you guys can get plastic solid transfers for very cheap one color starts around 15 cents the only thing is you guys have to pay a 25 feet to make the screens so if you guys don't want to buy all the equipment this can be a great alternative now the next way to make t-shirts is by using professional laser printers so no guys this cannot be a regular laser printer that you have at home this has to be a special led printer an example is a okie printer which prints white and color these printers can cost up to ten thousand dollars depending on how large they can print and whether or not they print white basically the way it works is that you print the design on the transfer sheet and then heat press it onto the t-shirt you will print the design on one shirt and then heat press it onto a glue side of another sheet and then peel it and press it onto the shirt you guys can also make metallic fall shirts this way simply print on one sheet put the foil over it press and peel the foil the best transfer sheets in my opinion are forever transfer sheets they're the highest quality let's talk about the pros and cons of laser printers all right guys so the pros of laser printing is that it's fast and easy it's not messy and you can also make all kinds of unique designs such as gold metallic foils the cons are obviously it's expensive also the good quality transfer papers are not cheap and to be honest with you guys i prefer the results of dtg printing much more than laser alright let's talk about the next way to make t-shirts and that's with the vinyl cutter alright just so you guys understand with the vinyl cutter you cannot make picture t-shirts the way vinyl cutting works is you insert the sheet into the vinyl cutter and the vinyl cutter will cut out your design you guys can buy different color vinyls and you can also buy unique vinyl such as glitter and metallic you can also buy special vinyl such as 3d vinyl where after you heat press it the vinyl becomes puffy you can also layer different colors together and have a multi-color design you guys can also buy cheap vinyl cutters such as the cricut machine the machine will come with a 3d designing software you will simply make your stencil you will then insert your vinyl and the machine will start cutting it out after that you will need to weed out the parts of the image that you will not be using you will simply take a weeding tool and remove the unnecessary parts you will then heat press the image onto the t-shirt and your shred is ready let's talk about the pros and cons of vinyl cutters the pros are vinyl cutters are cheap and you can make great quality t-shirts easily you can also make unique t-shirts like glow-in-the-dark foil and glitter shirts the cons are you cannot print photos and unless you guys are importing from alibaba in large quantities the photos can be expensive all right guys very quick let's talk about how to get tags for your t-shirts there are going to be many websites such as custom labels for you where you can order woven tags and paper tags free t-shirts these are very cheap if you order in large quantities they can run as little as 10 cents per tag you guys can choose if you want sonar tags or if you want iron on tags when you order your t-shirts off of jiffy shirts you would simply cut the tag off if it has a tag or if it has a tearaway label you just tear away the label and apply the tag we talked about plastisol labels earlier you guys can also order plastisol labels on websites like etsy you guys can get these for as little as 15 cents per label alright guys very quickly i want to talk about a couple of budget ways to make t-shirts first ways you guys can get an inkjet printer and use transfer sheets it's recommended that you guys get a printer that prints a3 which is larger images you guys can get a printer such as the epson wf7710 this is a great option also this printer can be converted to a sublimation printer if you want to go that route you can get a sublimation spray spray it on a blank cotton t-shirt print the sublimation print press and you have a sublimated t-shirt keep in mind this can only be done with white shirts these printers recently went up in price so if you guys don't plan to do sublimation you can get any regular printer that prints a3 for cheap when you guys print on the transfer sheets you will use the original ink now this information ink these are great ways to start a side hustle but if you guys want a real t-shirt business i suggest you save up money and go with either dtg or screen printing let's talk about the next way to make t-shirts and that's print on demand this is one of the best and easiest ways to start a t-shirt business and requires no startup costs but the catches you guys need to be somewhat social media savvy and know how to drive traffic to your store with print on demand you don't have to buy any equipment or blank t-shirts this is all done through a third-party company whenever you get an order they make the t-shirt and send it to the customer make sure the designs you guys upload are in a png file which means it's a transparent let's talk about the pros and cons of print on demand the pros are you guys don't have to buy any equipment or t-shirts and there's no startup cost the cons are if you guys are making these t-shirts yourself it will cost you a lot less also you need to learn how to drive traffic through social media for this to work alright guys let's talk about how to make designs for your t-shirts if you guys know how to design t-shirts yourself that's great but if you guys don't don't worry you can go on websites such as fiverr.com and have your designs made there you can pay anywhere from five to twenty dollars to have a design made when you guys are finished make sure you always get a master adobe illustrator file or a photoshop psd file this way if the files need to be edited you can always do that alright guys i hope this video helped you out if it did please hit the like button and subscribe and if you guys have any questions please ask in the comments below i'll see you guys the next one", "NKSd7Cqsfk0": "Today we're talking about the Next Level\n60/40 CVC t-shirt. Now this is one of our favorite t-shirts by Next Level because it's a great price point and for just a little more than a hundred percent\nring-spun cotton offers a ton more softness. That 60/40 blend of polyester/cotton means it's gonna be so much softer than just a hundred percent ring-spun cotton t-shirt.\nStill offers a great fit, awesome colors. Instead of just telling you though, we do have our model here, he's gonna come over and show it off. First thing you'll notice is just a\ngreat fit. It has this tailored side seam like all Next Level t-shirts have. So that means it's gonna naturally cut in and it's not going to be that boxy shirt we all grew up in. Next the neckline, the neckline is great 60/40 means it does have more stretch than a ring-spun cotton. It's just awesome because it's not gonna be tight on your neck. The sleeve length is also great it hits mid-bicep here, perfect dip right there. We love this shirt for so\nmany reasons. One of the other things about it is the colors, it comes in so many\ncool colors and as you can see it's a little heathered here. Meaning made of kind of speckles of different shades. That's signature to a blend because a blend is made of different fabric types, Cotton and Poly. So, with this we naturally recommend a vintage ink a thinner coat of ink, so that if we do a vintage white this blue color can come through just a little and make it look a little older, because the heather already looks a little aged, so that just plays off of it. We can always do a standard ink, do a bright white ink, but it's a little thicker.And this shirt is just so soft, so thin, it just moves with your body. Great length on the Next Level shirt too. Care instruction wise, you're not gonna have to worry about shrinking it. That polyester means that over the course of a lot of washes, it's not gonna pill. If you're ordering for volunteers or an event that needs to go on week after week after week or maybe\nit's your staff shirt this is a great step up. Go with this any day over a hundred\npercent ring-spun because it's gonna wear so much better over year or two. You're gonna love\nthis shirt! Tyler, you look awesome in it too! Tyler: \"Thank you.\" Thank you. On the Coed Monkey Soft Scale we rate this t-shirt a three. Thanks for watching this video. Please let us know if you have any questions because here at Coed Monkey, Soft Matters and so do our customers.", "xcxZIkS0Pl0": "welcome back to another episode of the sweet red puppy I'm Kimberly and today we are going to be working with crickets and fusible ink I am so excited to share this product with you because it's brand new and it's so amazing so infusible ink these are transfer sheets that you can buy and what's different about infusible ink from iron-on is that it's actually going to infuse into your fabric instead of laying on top of your fabric like you normally have with iron-on this is actually going to adhere itself to the fibers of your your shirt which is really neat and it's 100% permanent which is so neat you don't have to worry about flaking peeling and he tears in your material because this is actually ink that you're going to be putting onto your material for this project you'll need some transfer sheets you'll also need a Cricut ez press you'll need a compatible base this is a polyester shirt when you wet your paper a lint roller and a Cricut machine so let's go ahead and get started to get started you want to use a standard grip mat like this green one so I'm going to place this in front of me and open up my infeasible ink and I want to place my transfer sheet pretty side facing upwards so that the liner is facing downward inside of your package oven fusible ink you'll find a piece of butcher paper as well as your in fusible ink transfer sheets so I'm going to choose this watercolor one and something to keep in mind is that once you put heat on your infuse herbal ink transfer sheets it will be much more vibrant so it starts out as kind of a muted color but once you apply heat to it it becomes really bright and bold so I'm going to apply this to my mat and I'm just using a standard grip mat for this project and now I'm going to pull up design space so I've just selected mirror on I'm going to press Continue and select the correct machine and over here I'm going to select custom on the dial for my Cricut machine so now that I've selected in fusible ink transfer sheet within design space I'm going to insert my mat into my Cricut and now that the machine is done cutting I'm going to eject my mat and I'm going to remove the transfer sheet from my mind I'm just going to flip my mat upside down and then peel the mat away from the infusible link what this does is it prevents any damage from happening to your material if both of my transfer chutes are cut out I'm going to cut around the design I'm just going to set this aside and use it on another project I'm going to grab a pair of tweezers and I just want to remove the pieces that I don't want on this design it can be helpful to roll this back and forth until it lifts up off of the transfer sheet and if you want to keep the excess intact you can actually reuse that part of your transfer [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and now I'm ready to get started on my shirt so I want to preheat my ez press over here make sure that it's preheating what prepare my mat and my shirt one of the things to keep in mind when preparing your shirt is that you want to make sure that there's no fibers that are left behind that shouldn't be on the shirt so I have a little mini lint roller that's from cricket and I'm just going to go back and forth across my shirt to where the transfer is going to be placed and just remove any little fibers that might be there and the reason why you do this is because some of the extra fibers that could be on your shirt that aren't supposed to be there could turn a different color when they're exposed to a high temperature of heat so I just want to make sure that this is nice and clean and others not anything on this shirt that shouldn't be there I'm going to stack my invisible ink on each other that way I don't have to go back and do a second press it's best if you just do one press when you're working with us otherwise the color can fade after repeated pressing so I'm turning it over and just making sure that it looks good from the right side and now I'm going to Center my design on my t-shirt like to fold my design in half just to get a better idea of where the center is actually located at I'm going to press this in place at this point you could use some of the heat resistant tape if you want to make sure that it stays in place this is pretty sticky so I'm just going to adhere it to the fabric I'm going to slide a piece of butcher paper inside of my shirt and what that does is it just keeps the in fusible ink from bleeding through to the other side want to make sure that this design is only on the front of my shirt now I'm going to cover this with a piece of butcher paper my Cricut ez press is all the way warmed up I'm just going to place it on top it's set to 40 seconds I'm going to press my Cricut button and apply from heat now I'm going to slowly release going straight up because I don't want to accidentally move my design I'm going to remove my butcher paper and then I'm gonna let this cool just a little bit now I'm going to use a pair of tweezers to remove my transfer sheet it will be a little bit hot and look how beautiful this design is and you can go ahead and remove your cardstock now here's our final result for care of this shirt make sure to wash it on hold and don't use

expression fiber arts calm and I will put the direct link in the description below for you so the lace patterning starts with some basic knit and purl rows and those are rows 1 through 6 so I've worked those and made a little swatch here just to get started and then the actual visible lace patterning you see is rows 7 through 11 and that is what I'm gonna be showing you how to worked in it here's row 7 but row number 7 you're going to start by knitting 4 1 2 3 4 and then you're going to work a knit two together so just insert your right needle into two stitches and knit those two together then you're going to work a yarn over and knit 4 and this is just one repeat of the lace pattern you're gonna repeat this across your row [Music] now for row number eight for row number eight you're just gonna purl every stitch across your row so nice relaxing row there's actually only three rows in this pattern that have the lay stitching so the yarn overs and then the other rows are just simple pearls and knits and there you go okay now we're gonna work Row nine row number nine you're going to start with a knit three one two three then you're going to do a knit two together so just knit those next two stitches together then you're gonna work a yarn over and knit one another yarn over then a slip slip knit so slip your next stitch onto your right needle slip the next one onto your right needle and I like to sort of pull that down a little bit so I can easily insert my left needle into those two stitches and then knit them and then you're going to knit the final two stitches let's go ahead and do a row number ten row ten is another one of those easy soothing or laxing rows and watch some TV it's just purling all the way across and when you've worked at this row you're really going to be able to see these yarn overs pop out which is what forms that visual of the lace patterning we'll just finish that up and I'll show you how you can see those beautiful little yarn overs loop there they are and finally let's go ahead and do row 11 for row 11 you're going to start with a knit two one - then you're going to knit two together like so then you're going to do a yarn over knit three one two the REE then another yarn over and a slip slip knit just like we did before slip that next stitch onto your right needle slip the next one pull down your work a little bit

"kPUMT4N8IEo": "what's up guys my name is Dan McCready I'm here at Twin Cities in st. Paul Minnesota and today we're going to talk about the different kinds of cotton when choosing the right t-shirt you can only love you if you've looked at cotton t-shirts you'll probably see that there are a lot of different options you've got standard cotton ring spun combed ring spun heirloom organic lemon shrimp coconut shrimp what do these all mean what are the differences between these types of shirts first of all all cotton no matter if it's ring spun combed organic it all has to go through a process of spinning where the cotton is drawn out into long strands and turned into a yarn the yarns later sewn into fabric which makes your t-shirt so your basic standard cotton t-shirt such as your gilding g500 it's spun into a yarn but a lot of the short strands of cotton and left in there and you get a rougher feel less durability because of that it's the least expensive oh it's a shirt and I saved a buck next you've got your ring spun cotton all that means is there's an additional process of spinning the yarn and in that a lot of those short strands will be taken out this gives you a softer more durable type of cotton not too shabby the next one is your combed ring spun cotton and that's just an additional process of coming out short and mid-sized strands of cotton leaving you with a really long strong durable piece of yarn and then this would be like your next level 3600 your American Apparel these give you a much softer much more durable t-shirt this shirt is really soft and nice I love it if you've looked at Bella canvas shirt so you've noticed they have something called heirloom cotton all this really is is a cone ring spun cotton they've coined their own term heirloom cotton it's their process of towing and spinning the cotton and it's a marketing term they claim it's the best in the industry if it is or not that's up to you to decide but that's all that is is a cone ring spun cotton heirloom cotton huh highlight misty and then lastly we've got organic cotton which has nothing to do if it's ring spun or told and everything to do with the way it was grown and harvested in an eco-friendly way so to recap you start with your standard cotton also known as carded open in cotton that's your cheapest least durable roughest feeling cotton and then you go up to ring-spun which is softer more durable a little more expensive and then you go into your combed ring-spun cotton t-shirt those are much more expensive but they're much softer very durable very nice t-shirts are made out of this and then finally you can go into your organic Cotton's which make the price go up even father if you're looking to have t-shirts made head over to Twin Cities com fill out a quote form and we'll get you set up thank you guys for watching this episode I hope you guys enjoyed this and we'll see you on the next video if you have any questions leave us a comment you", "fVJWMmDwH50": "We're talking about the Next Level 100%\nring-spun cotton long sleeve t-shirt. This is one of our favorite long sleeve\nt-shirts for a few reasons. First off, is the price point, it fits great into any budget and for just a\nlittle more expensive than a hundred percent cotton Gildan, you get a much\nsofter shirt. The colors, there aren't as many options as maybe the Gildan one,\nbut they're awesome because they're very standard. Instead of just telling you about the shirt though, about the fit and everything we do have our model. He's gonna come over and basically show this thing off. The first thing you're gonna notice is it does fit great, very tailored side. We have a seam right here that contours to the body just like every Next Level\nt-shirt. Next let's look at the neckline. The neckline on this is, it's bound on the inside, good stretch, a hundred percent ring-spun\ncotton. Just an awesome neckline. There's not too many special things about the neck on this shirt because it's just a standard crew neck. The sleeves though, awesome thing to note here, they're not baggy. How many of us grew up with a long sleeve t-shirt? Maybe you got it in sports and they're super baggy, you know like you think, who did they make this thing for? how many people are they fitting in here? No this shirt looks like it was made for Tyler, right here. Another thing is the sleeves. Normal long sleeve shirts have a big cuff this shirt basically just has a seam right here, so, there will be pictures on our site that you can look at for this but it's one seam right there so it's not a thick cuff. Great for pulling up it's just an awesome sleeve it doesn't feel heavy and as structured as other brands. If you compare this to the Canvas hundred percent ring-spun cotton one, you're gonna find that this one maybe feels a little more like an unstructured shirt a little more casual. I also love the\nring spun cotton in this very soft. Over the course of a good amount of washes it\nwill maintain its softness too. So, if you're looking for a great hundred percent ring-spun\ncotton long sleeve shirt. It fits a great price point, comes in awesome colors and a great fit. You look awesome in it Tyler. Thank you. On the Coed Monkey Soft Scale we rate this t-shirt a two.

The result is called Airlume. It starts with clean\ncotton about 25 to 30 percent of the cotton we start with is combed out \nduring our unique refining process. Because it contains impurities or does\nnot meet our standards. It's a common practice for manufacturers to dump some\nof that inferior cotton back in before spinning the yarn. But for us when it's\ncombed out it stays out. We only use long staple cotton in our Airlume process.\nThe staple length refers to the length of the cotton fiber. And this determines\nthe ultimate feel of the final yarn. By using only long staple cotton there are\nless stray fibers which keeps our yarn smoother on the microscopic level. This\nmakes for a tight even knit ideal for screen printing. We continue to innovate\nthrough the dyeing process. Using seven times less water than the industry\naverage and only using the most eco-friendly dyes. There's a right way to\ndo combed in ring-spun and it's through our Airlume process that we're able to\nmake the industry softest cotton. At Bella+Canvas were committed to using 100%\nAirlume combed and ring spun cotton. Be Different.", "oqq8sQT_bo8": "Welcome back to the Gentleman's Gazette. Today's video is the ultimate guide to Polo\nShirts. Polo shirt materials and which one you should\ngo for. Probably the most popular Polo shirt material\nare cotton blended fabric with polyester. It's popular because it somewhat soft. The polyester adds more longevity, colors\ndon't wash out as easily and they are more robust. However, blended materials are less comfortable\nthan pure cotton. They are usually less expensive, favored by\ngrocery stores, Target, or for uniforms. If you wear them personally, in your spare\ntime, I would suggest that you go with all cotton Polo Shirt. Sometimes, these blend polo shirts are also\nsold as \"performance\" and in fact, some are performance in the sense that they are trying\nto move away the moisture from your body when you play golf or tennis. other times, it's more of a marketing ploy\nto use a less expensive fiber or material then sold as more high end. So personally, I prefer natural fibers over\nartificial fibers but it's something that you have to decide on your own. Polo Shirts made out of a hundred percent\npolyester are the cheapest one you can find, you will sweat very easily, you'll overheat\nand it has a very ugly, shiny look that just screams cheap. I would recommend avoid polyester polo shirts\nat all cost. Silk Polo shirts are usually more expensive\ncos it's a more expensive fiber and all silk polos are not really around because the fiber\nis a bit too shiny and it's not really absorbent but when blended with cotton or linen, it\ncan be a really nice material. It is often used for luxury Polo shirts that\nwant to distinguish themselves from less expensive Polo shirts. In recent years, linen has become more popular\nbecause of its three dimensional structure and the irregular yarns that are used to either\nweave it or knit it and Polo shirts, that's true as well. however, linen is much harsher and coarser\nthan cotton so I would recommend if you want this look, look for a linen cotton blend fabric\nor another blend with silk fabric so you get the soft feel on your skin with the texture\nand the look you like. In the medium and high priced segment, the\nhundred percent cotton Polo shirts are definitely among the most popular ones. Cotton is classic, it's absorbent, it keeps\nthe color in better qualities, keep it for longer, just like with any material, cotton\ndoes not always equal cotton. There's a staple length and how pure it is,\nhow the yarn is spun but at the end of the day, cotton is a great material for Polo shirts\nand it's a classic that you can definitely rely on. Now, it's not all about the materials, it's\nalso about how it is made up and as I said Rene Lacoste invented the cotton mesh. Now sometimes you will see people talking\nabout Polo shirts fabric and when they say that you know they have no clue, Polo shirts\nare knitted, not woven which is why they are not a fabric. The difference is a fabric only stretches\nin one way and knit stretches in all ways is therefore more flexible and comfortable\nto wear. What is knitting? Knitting is a process of interlooping yarns\nwhile weaving means you have warp and weft and you go back and forth and up and down. You want to knit the fabric for your polo\nshirt because it's more flexible and comfortable to wear and it stretches into all directions\nbecause it's interlooped. You have two kinds of basic knits that are\nimportant, i am not going to talk about all the 25 ones, just two basic ones so you can\ndistinguish. You have jersey knit and pique knit. Pique knit is the more classic knit and it\nhas a waffle like structure and the name is derived from the marcela pique fabric which\nis woven and has not really much to do with the pique knit that is knitted but it has\nthe same waffle structure the same look which is why it gets its name. Different manufacturers have different sizes\nof the knit, a larger waffle knit will be more breathable but also heavier a finer knit\nwill be more lightweight but has smaller holes. Overall, pique knit is really classic, I really\nlike it and it's usually a little more expensive to produce which is why most manufacturers\nstill use pique and only the cheaper ones are using jersey knits. Here, I'm wearing a jersey knit polo which\nis cheaper it's a cotton poly blend that I don't really like but on the other hand if\nyou look at this Brioni shirt which is very expensive it also has the jersey knit. You can't always just say a jersey knit is\nalways less expensive because it depends on the brand and depends on the materials. In general, overall, jersey knit is usually\nused for less expensive Polo shirts , pique knit is used for more expensive ones. Next up, Polo shirt collars.", "OgvdeTXDIsQ": "[Music] what's up guys today we are talking about our favorite t-shirts what's up guys welcome back to Gen stands I'm George this is Blake if you have not hit that subscribe button yet hit that right now we are here every week talking about men's fashion lifestyle and today our favorite t-shirts now guys this is not just about one t-shirt this video is not sponsored these are the t-shirts that are in our closet what we wear on a regular basis and most of these are over a year old so we know that they can wear in so we get asked all the time what is the best t-shirt and the answer is like well what do you want to do what do you want to wear it for how tall are you how muscular are you so the right t-shirt for you is not necessarily the right t-shirt for me like me and Blake have completely different styles sizes and things that we look for in a t-shirt so my picks might not be exactly the same as Blake's picks but I'm gonna give you the reasons and Blake's gonna give you the reasons of why he picked his and why I picked mine so I think for me the most important thing when it comes to a t-shirt is something that washes well doesn't shrink in the wash keeps its shape and doesn't get like a funky texture after you want you know some t-shirts get like chilly and you're gross so all of my t-shirts in my selection I've had for over a year they wash easily I don't have to hang dry them I don't have to baby them because their t-shirts guys if I'm gonna baby some clothes it's gonna be a more expensive dress shirt or a suit but I'm not I'm not trying to spend all this time washing and drying and hang dry and t-shirts I want a shirt that looks good feels good and makes me feel good quite frankly you know so like it has to be like fitted but not too fitted you know I'm not the type of guy who wears like that Freddie Mercury super tight shirt you know but I do want to feel like you know a little muscular even though I'm not quite muscular you know but today I'm wearing what I call like my casual my every day teacher this is from Todd Snider this is a very relaxed relaxed fit it's not tight at all I've owned it since we're in 2019 since 2016 yes guys so there are different types of t-shirts for different types of occasions different textures different weights that work well for you know a denim jacket versus a suit jacket if you're going to go as an undershirt type deal so we're going to just kind of fly through these brands real quick because there's eight of them and if we spent too much time this would be a very very long video so for Blake Todd Snider was his first one I'm a huge fan of byl tea basically they make a luxe and like a regular premium version I like the premium cotton better than the luxe because the luxe is a little bit stretchier and it's a little too snug for me in the medium which I like to wear kind of a slimmer t-shirt I love these t-shirts they're super comfortable they're definitely not a shirt that I would wear with a suit because you see these little like kind of stitching's around the arms and whatnot it's just kind of a little too casual to dress up this type of a t-shirt alright guys so for my second sure it's is like my most luxurious of shirts and this is one of my most casual t-shirts is by Mac Walden it's about 45 bucks so it's not too expensive you know it's a 100% Pima kind it's very very comfortable very relaxed I typically use these with just t-shirt and jeans and I don't tuck it in so this is like my day to day t-shirt what I like about them is that they're not super fitted there's a little loose and I think they make their shirts for like every type of guy you know so they're not like for your muscular guy you're not they're not for your like your chubby guy is just a regular shirt it's like an elevated Hanes alright guys up next is my most luxurious shirt this is by Jason Scott and this is this is the shirt I wear with the suit this is I've had these for so long I wear the crap out of them they wash well they they're just really really nice it's Peruvian cotton so it's pretty nice yeah yeah this is the most expensive t-shirt I think in this area this is like $68 but which is which is a lot it's a lot of money yeah for a t-shirt we're not talking there's no there's no graphics on there it's just a regular plain t-shirt but I've had these for four years I love it so I mean yeah I love is it is an investment and it does seem like a lot but if you had the same t-shirt for four years you're definitely spending way more than $80 on Hanes t-shirt because you're going through those the neck stretches out they don't wash well so you know spend your money on quality pieces and I think every sister in this selection is a quality piece that will last you a good year plus so my third shirt here is from express this is more of your economical shirt it's only I mean today I brought like a salmon color one but they have like various different colors this one here is $22 the case so it's it's nicely priced and for the most part they're always about 30% off so you can get this shirt for anywhere from 12 bucks to 20 bucks sometimes they have a buy one get one free this is not sponsored guys I mean I am really a fan of these shirts they have that moisture wiccaning one that doesn't like you sweating it doesn't really show a lot or it kind of hides the sweat that's why I'm a big fan of them this is probably my least expensive other shirts but the one I wear mostly with suits last but not least for me I have buck Mason and I think this is the best bang for your buck t-shirt no pun intended a right these are like $32 and I've had this one for another four years at least but it's the heather gray which I think is I don't know this it gives a nice texture and makes the t-shirt kind of a little interesting for being plain so you can kind of wear this under it I wear this under a denim jacket constantly and it's just you know probably with this hat as well yeah I mean what but I think book Mason does more of like your Americana there man America yeah it's like you could hop on a motorcycle and I love it yeah they're not quite cowboy but they're not quite hipster they're like in-between the cool I'm a fan of them you know I know the guys really well they'd be do shirts for a while I mean system it's one of the best made shirts it's made in America so you know you're supporting American jobs in American labor so a plus two buck Mason right so now up next Captain America we have essentials so you I'm sure you guys know of jose zuniga teaching minutes fashion he does he decided him and his brother daily at their own t-shirt line well now it's a full-on fashion line but uh do pretty kick-ass t-shirts really soft really fitted this is the shirt that's gonna make you feel muscular even if you're not quite muscular they have I mean it's really soft like I'm saying I typically would wear these with like jeans or even like a sweats I kind of elevate my look when I'm wearing it but I keep it very very minimal so when I said some shirts aren't meant for both Blake and I this is one of the shirts that I'm talking about I have these shirts out of the bag there luxurious they're comfortable they're amazing t-shirts except for me the large was what Isis the what size I usually wear it fits me in the arms perfectly but squeezes me like extra tight around the midsection and you know if if I've had a pretty good sized meal that day you can you can see the meal yeah so you know sometimes even Excel is just too big for me so if you're not like looking for like a super loose fitted t-shirt you make sure you size up I was yeah yeah these are mine you trimmed and the the fabric is like it's a last it like stretches but it squeezes you a little bit alright guys so lastly we have a Polish this is a shirt I've been wearing oh dude I want to say five years six years when I first started blogging even before that what I liked about Paul's is that they're I mean they actually put thought into who's making their shirts so they go around the world and they they source a specific fabric but they get it made in an area from like Africa to Mexico to Peru to Colombia and they they really really put thought into making sure that who's ever making a shirt is actually getting paid a good amount you know and they're a good brand I've been wearing a shirt like I said five years I've wanted to out of this shirt right here I worked at Hong Kong to India I mean in New York I wash it about like 40 50 times it's a good shirt is trimmed this is this one fits you a lot like the book Mason so it has that like just casual to feel to it not too luxurious but you know it is a higher price shirt in that it is about 35 bucks right so that pretty much wraps up our favorite t-shirts we love to all these down below but remember guys not every t-shirt is right for you or the style that you're wanting to wear so you know if you're wearing suits you definitely want to look for a nicer collar a nice texture kind of a smoother shirt and if you're going casual obviously you can wear pretty much anything but if you're trying to elevate and dress things up it's probably a different t-shirt than your your denim and jacket heather gray type t-shirt and obviously fits are gonna be different for different types of people like I'm a bigger guy than Blake so what fits me well doesn't necessarily fit Blake well and vice versa so remember that you know you got to think about your size how tall you are how long is the shirt is there's a lot more than just like me telling you this is the best t-shirt ever go buy it now so that's why we have eight different brands here that are very very well made t-shirts and different price points different categories but I ramble so that's pretty much wraps that the video will have links to all these down below if you haven't I hit that

vinyl often but haven't had the opportunity to press heat transfer paper while the differences are clear between the two in that heat transfer paper can print full multicolored images with a single sheet of paper there are still some technicalities to keep in mind for instance what is the difference between light and dark heat transfer paper is there paper specifically for inkjet or laser printers or how about sublimation I'm a Stephan with the oppressed nation and I'll be covering such questions and more details about heat transfer paper that will give you a better idea of what options will best suit your needs if you're joining us for the first time be sure to subscribe and click the notification bill to be the first to watch tutorials streams and more from heat press nation if you're looking for details about heat transfer vinyl check out our video guide on HTV which you can watch right now by clicking the card above now let's get started heat transfer paper is intended for use on garments or other substrates with cotton cotton blend fabrics or synthetic fabrics as polyester nylon and lycra transfer paper can permanently transfer onto these substrates thanks to the polymer film able to bond the ink and fabrics together it is available in the standard u.s. letter and tabloid sizes of respectively eight and a half by 11 inches and 11 by 17 inches as mentioned earlier using heat transfer paper can bring full-color graphics of multiple layers down to a single sheet making the process of pressing detailed images much easier and efficient than before while some papers can transfer with no visible background or whitespace foremost we recommend to either cut paper transfers by hand or use the contour cutting feature of a vinyl cutter also known as printing cut let's go back to our first question what is the difference between light and dark heat transfer paper more specifically why are there two kinds of heat transfer paper available for printers light heat transfer paper is designed for pressing on white or lightly colored fabrics while dark transfer paper is for pressing onto black or darkly colored fabrics considering that printers do not need white ink for printer like heat transfer paper uses the white or light color of the fabric as a substitute well dark transfer paper prints like normal paper using the white of the paper itself hence why Sommer named opaque due to the way light transfer paper is transferred images must always be mirrored before printing them but this will not be necessary for dark transfer paper prints whether you are transferring on mostly light or dark garments or whether you use an inkjet or laser printer be sure to always have the proper heat transfer paper ready for your garments and press your transfers firmly moving on to the second question there indeed is heat transfer papers specifically made for inkjet and laser printers inkjet transfer paper is best for any inkjet printer at home or work likewise for laser transfer paper with laser printers these papers are specific to their printers as inkjet transfer paper is designed to hold wet ink while laser transfer paper can only hold toner with the inkjet heat transfer paper being as simple as either light or dark paper laser transfer paper is further divided into single or full color and white toner papers single color laser transfer paper is compatible with both light and dark garments while full color paper has separate light and dark offerings similar to inkjet paper white toner laser transfer papers are unique in that they are specifically made for white toner laser printers typically printing transfers in one or multiple colors alongside having the ability to self read the background or blank space of the printed image for both inkjet and laser transfer paper we recommend to use the best available quality settings for printing but keep in mind that over saturating the ink will cause it to bleed upon washing and weight after a day before washing any garment just press with either transfer paper and do not dry clean the garment lastly right after pressing any inkjet and single or full color laser transfer we recommend lightly stretching the transfer on garments to build up its softness and durability so far we've covered what heat transfer paper is available for inkjet and laser printers but did you know that sublimation papers are specifically for sublimation printers such as those from Sawgrass Rico and Epson this is due to the unique ink of sublimation which will print a solid form of an image which can then transfer onto a bright substrate through a gaseous state when you press with this in mind we advise against using any sublimation paper on basic inkjet or laser printers the sublimation papers we offer for sublimation printers are text print are for gel based ink alongside text print xbh are a water-based ink bold papers are compatible with any sublimation printers such as the Sawgrass SG 400 or SG 800 make sure to choose the paper compatible with the ink currently in the printer if you would like to learn more about sublimation visit our sublimation page to watch our guide video and browse our selection of sublimation products all in all if you are frequently pressing detailed images or graphics onto garments or other substrates heat transfer paper can deliver the results with full-color on just a single sheet even being limited to basic inkjet or laser printers still leaves you open with the opportunity to print with inkjet or laser transfer paper just find the paper compatible with your printer and light or dark substrates and remember that white toner laser transfer and sublimation paper will require different printers if you were interested in pressing with heat transfer paper soon we offer sample packs for both inkjet and laser printers with a three sheet variety of around 18 to 21 sheets of paper for both bundles essentially giving you a platter of transfer papers to try printing and pressing but we hope this video has introduced you well to heat transfer paper and if you enjoyed it be sure to LIKE subscribe and click the notification

"Tn-RC9xdVM8": "what up guys james here AKA the palm and today i want to go ahead and kick off the clothing and style side of this channel and i want to do so with a series of reviews about kind of like the basics the essentials of everyday like wear and also at just as important i want to go ahead and make these non sponsored videos i want to be able to speak to you frankly honestly and just tell you guys what my favourites are and what I perceive to be the best like products on the clothing market and so today I want to talk about like the basic t-shirt and I will talk about the basic t-shirt because I'm not interested in that like excessive stuff you know I prefer very minimalist approach to clothing and sometimes like a pseudo street wear and so I don't want no t-shirt with like I don't know like a  unhand color on hand like side or super long where you look like you have no torso or like bedazzled back I don't know the like the other people will be talking about what I want is a very simple very minimalist just quality t-shirt and so what I perceive to be the best t-shirt on the market right now is the American Apparel power-washed II based on its like the fabric the fit the price and just how well it fits into my style and so I've tried the full range of clothing I tried like t-shirts from like the 6080 like hundred dollar range down to like the six eight ten dollar range like we have like the APC NORs project and then the more readily available I kind of I would say retail store like rebranded t-shirts like J Crew club like Monaco like stuff like that like I've tried that more range at the same time I've also like worn like the whole gap like pains Gildan anvil and I've seen like the hmm those are like the fast fashion type of things and the American Apparel power-washed tea is what I ended up perceiving to be the best one like it fits most well into what I prefer to have like on my upper body like the t-shirt is like on this loser and the length is like at the crotch or slightly below and like American Apparel stays pretty loyal like the LA's like upbringing like the solid California fit is a very unique thing that I have a hard time finding with many other night t-shirt brands but like this slightly looser fit is what I'm used to is what I prefer is what I'm most comfortable with and so what we have is like a light slightly looser and fit overall we have short sleeves are slightly longer than usual slightly looser a neckline that's also slightly looser and that's also finer and the overall weight is definitely like a medium light and so it really fits well into like like the weather here I mean I don't dress for seasons because in California you don't need to and the thing is like this t-shirt also embodies like most effectively like the minimal list like aesthetics that I prefer like with the North Project t-shirts like they're beautiful they're on the heavier side given that they're like like a company base over in that area and outside of America they also have a different sort of fit definitely longer and slimmer which doesn't really work well with me at the same time a PC another non American brand definitely has a longer fit but has these strange shorts like the sleeves are also loose I kind of give you these like emperor's shoulders almost and like it's a nice t-shirt definitely expensive like eighty a hundred dollars but for the fit I'm not going to pay that much quality is definitely there but for the fit I'm going to stick to like the twenty five dollar American Apparel power wash teeth because it has all the same like accolades but it's definitely like a much better price then we step down to like the gap pains like anvil Gildan range and you get like really cheap t-shirts t-shirts that you can replace on like a monthly basis sometimes a weekly basis but the thing is you only have to replace them because they're so shitty that they just fall apart where they ball up the closest the next runner-up I would consider it to be like the gaps essential tea that one has a similar a very similar like feel also lightweight very nice fabric but the thing is it shrinks sometimes do you wash the pea which monitor you get and if it doesn't is typically the type of model that kind of balls up and just becomes like a shitty and uncomfortable t-shirt so I like their stuff and I would choose it second but with the American Apparel power wash tea being readily available there's no reason for me to opt for one of those cheaper brands and then with the HTM the Zara you're paying a very low price and it typically looks good but it's like the worst t-shirt you'll ever wear I mean those fast fashion places just basically so you cheap what's trending and for a very low price but very low quality sometimes even lower quality and so that's like not even a choice me I don't we consider that and basically like I picked this t-shirt also because like the colors that are available are like very nice and there have a huge range they also have like a section that's kind of muted or like neutral s and so I prefer like the port which is like the wine color the maroon type of color I plan to use this on the next t-shirt we print here at the pump and this is the teacher we use with the bank you baste pump on t-shirt so I know a lot of guys are surprised to quality never the model for and yeah this is what I was talking about the Navy is actually pretty nice under this light normally it's kind of the darker end and I would prefer to be a little bit bluer you have the white t-shirt or course and then you have this like neutral tan gray as type of thing and the color for this one is probably my favorite out of all the t-shirts because many other brands offer this neutral gray like tan greenish I guess color but those ones typically end up low to like much like skin tone and it looks like you're not wearing a t-shirt which is really weird or at least I think is really weird I know some of the other youtubers probably think it's legit but then again they also probably wear fish in it too but this is what I prefer these types of basics are what I wear on a daily basis and like I have like the crazy range of other clothing but at the end of the day I see end up wearing these like almost all the time that's why I have like like over 10 of these I think almost 20 like powerwash tees but yeah so that's my perspective on like the basic tees I proceed these to definitely be like the best t-shirt currently on the market that's a reasonable price and damn good quality and so okay I have something out of this video and the next one I'm hoping to talk about kind of watch my favorite denim my period favorite pair or model of like salvaged jeans and we'll continue down this I whole like essential like everyday wear type of theme and yeah hope you guys got something on this video and peace", "113vu1W79U8": "yo what does give everybody thank you so much for stopping by the channel once again from us over here at Locust mob honey so today's video should be relatively short simple and sweet as we are gonna be going over five easy steps to taking a standard black vintage t-shirt and turning it that cream color way now just before we get started I did want to give credit where it's due so huge shout out to the originator of this idea Jakob Keller the man the myth the legend of the og youtuber game he's been doing it for a minute now but what can I say man's is a model of consistency as it relates to dressing well he's also one of the best dudes on this platform so shout out to Jacob now if you guys did see his original pose and you saw how he was able to turn what was seemingly just a plain black vintage Braham t-shirt into this beautiful cream color way definitely very very unique needless to say when I saw that was like yo I have to try this and apparently that sentiment was shared among a ton of different people as the comment section was just filled with people asking how to do it what the concoction was how long it took and so on and so forth and actually there was a bunch of people in the Facebook group that attempted to do it I said there was a huge contingency to do this video here today so here it is we're gonna get it started a further adieu let's go and jump right into it [Music] so here it is this is what was formerly a black Metallica tee now it's a scream colorway and so that's one thing to really consider when you're gonna pick a t-shirt to do this to to treat with the bleach is to consider what's already on the t-shirt the color scheme the colorway and to decide if it'll look good because honestly some t-shirts just look better in black this one that's specifically I do think looks really cleaning out the silver Metallica font as well as the light blue graphic and some cream riding down at the bottom and obviously you got the silver Metallica sign on the back as well as the tour dates being in white but one thing is almost for certain is that you're gonna have black contrast stitching because obviously the stitches don't also bleach out to be cream they're just gonna stay black now with that said you're gonna need a few ingredients if you're gonna start this process the first thing you're going to need is bleach obviously this is the key component to starting this entire process the second thing you're gonna need is access to hot water this water is essential to somewhat dilute the mixture as well as its high temperature being able to loosen up the fibers to let the bleach do what its gonna do obviously if you have a mixture you're gonna have to have a container to put it in which is why I suggest using a bucket preferably one that's big enough to house everything that's gonna be in the mixer as well as be able to submerge the t-shirt so I would say the bigger the better and then last I highly highly suggest you use a pair of thick rubber gloves just because the nature of bleach tends to really dry out your hands so for the sake of safety I definitely suggest using a thick pair of rubber gloves now a couple things you might not need but might be helpful are a pair of tongs to be able to like check on the t-shirt kind of pull it up from the mixture as well as something to stir the mixture with or kind of push a t-shirt into the mixture for me I did use a wooden fork which I did find pretty helpful but like I said it's not exactly mandatory so now that you have all the necessary components for the process here are the five easy steps to follow to turn your black vintage tees cream so step one is to create your mix sure now there is a ton of different ways to do this but what I found for me personally is a mixture comprised of 70% Clorox which is exactly the entire gallon and 30% water makes for the perfect mixture something to denote guys is it doesn't need to be exact just more of an approximation one thing that I did want to stress for step one is to make sure that water is hot honestly the hotter the better just because that's what loosens the fibers and helps the process out a ton in fact if it's not for the hot water I don't know how cream you could get the t-shirt as I doubt it would become as light step to carefully carry the bucket outside or to a place with a lot of light to be able to ensure that you're able to see the color well as that's gonna be your measuring stick as to when to pull the t-shirt out step 3 through t-shirt into the mixture and watch the magic happen watch the discoloration happen because it happens almost instantly step 4 is a waiting process it's actually waiting washing and then waiting again make sure you have something to do in between time because the entire process takes about three hours so for me the shirt went into the bleach at about 3:45 p.m. like I said almost instantly the color began to change as a solution started to turn brown as well as the t-shirt this is evidence that the solution is good the water is warm enough and the bleach is doing its job now after a bit of time the shirt goes from dark brown to brown to dark olive to Olive then ultimately to tan which puts us at approximately 5:30 one hour and 45 minutes from when the t-shirt hit the mixture now bear in mind we are still in step four this is the washing phase and this part is particularly important because at this point the mixture is starting to cool down which is slowing down the process so I actually take the whole bucket inside and go ahead and rinse the t-shirt in piping hot water just to reheat those fibers up again to help the process along to expedite it anyways once you've completed the rinsing process to go ahead and throw the shirt back into the mixture take it back outside and this is the easy part you can go ahead and just leave it alone me personally I did leave it in the mixer for an additional one hour and 15 minutes and at this point you're starting to see the color fade out and it's becoming this cream color looks really really good but keep in mind it is still wet so it's a little bit darker than the final product but once that one hour and 15 minutes had elapsed I went ahead and gave it another rinse in very hot water I squeezed it out as best as I could and simply threw it in the wash and dryer and that essentially is the fifth and final step which ultimately gets you to this point here an ice cream vintage t-shirt honestly I'm very very happy with the results I definitely love to hear what you guys have to say in the comment section down below if you go ahead and try it anyways guys that's gonna do it for today's video hopefully it's clear enough and concise enough let me know in the comment section down below what you guys think about this shirt do you guys think I ruined a perfectly good vintage shirt or do you like the cream aspect of these t-shirts I definitely love to hear if any of you guys are gonna attempt it and if you're in the facebook group go ahead and post pictures I'll go ahead and start a thread for it I'd love to see what you guys end up doing with your shirts if you guys decide to go about it as always guys it is a major privilege to get to do what I get to do here on YouTube and make these videos for you now with all that being said as in every video here at locus well honey I'm gonna say peace and be blessed you", "cIgQpkEkhXA": "hey guys if you're interested in making t-shirts you've come to the right place I'm going to do a little t-shirt one-on-one with you about how to heat press a t-shirt stay tuned first I just want to show you my t-shirt this is my what Condon queen t-shirt that I made I got a lot of compliments on it so I'm going to teach you how to heat press t-shirts I'm going to do a couple of videos a little later on about how to you know print out a design how to make your design on silhouette and you know teach you a little bit so that you won't have such a hard time like I did in the beginning okay guys we are in the basement this is where I have my heat press machine I don't have an office space for this because there's just nowhere in the house for it we don't have an extra bedroom that no one's using so you have to put it where you can so anyway this is in my basement I just have a little corner my basement this is actually like a little window kind of thing in my basement near my storage so this is where I stuck it for now we're not finished with our basement so this is a little station I have a power heat press and you can go to WWE he trusts calm or I got minds off of Amazon and I'll put the price and everything below so anyway here it is and over here we don't have lights over here but this is the power button and as you can see the cord is coming out of the back you want to put your heat press near and outlet because this cord is this short and I'm just gonna go ahead and plug it up here you don't want to put it on an extension cord you don't want to attach your court to an extension cord so it needs to be near an outlet and it's gonna tell you what bolts and all that stuff you know that you need when the power press comes so this is the little book that came with mine and it's real simple it's really thin okay so I use the book and then also I use some tutorials but anyway you're gonna go ahead and flip the switch on and you want it set to 315 as you might have just seen that's what I have mine set on right now it is at 66 degrees and it has to heat up so you have to wait for it to heat up and I have mine set to a 16 second heat press and here are the buttons down here for your temperature settings I hope you can see that temperature settings and your time you're gonna click the tip button first and you're going to see the little arrow on the left hand side and I'm sorry I can't point to it right now because I'm holding down the heat press with one hand they're filming with the other so you're gonna tap that first button it says temp that's temperature and you're going to then go ahead and click start clicking on the up arrow and you will take it to where you want it sets you so if you want to set on 300 you know it might when you first turn it on for the first time it might be on you know 15 to 0 to 15 degrees so you're going to click that button all the way up until it says 300 or 315 degrees whatever you need it to be you're going to click it until it reaches until it says that number and then for the time you want to do the same I'm gonna click the time button and you're going to then go over one where you see the arrow up button right there and you're gonna click it up until it says 16 seconds or however many seconds you need your garment pressed for so most of my t-shirts are 100% cotton so what I do that's the setting that was recommended 315 degrees for 16 seconds so that's what I have mines and preset on it stays on that for the most part okay and this pressure knob mines kind of came already preset I really didn't have to do a lot to it the pressure is the amount of I wouldn't say weight but the amount of pressure that you want your shirts pressed at so that the letters are the vinyl sticks so to increase your pressure you're going to do it clockwise to decrease the put the pressure you're gonna do it counter clock the heat press is heating up to the temperature it needs to be you're going to position your t-shirt on the heat press and it's warm down here but this up here is what's hot that's the actual iron so you want to be careful with your hands and everything but you see where that nabhi is back there that's the center that's where I use my gauge for I don't measure and all of that stuff I've always been pretty good with you know just iron things and they come out well so you want to make sure the center of the t-shirt which this time I'm making a v-neck and this is the first time I'm doing a v-neck so you want to make sure that V is in the center with that retina and make sure that on the sides you have the same amount just kind of eye it make sure the same amount of cloth is hanging off now when you're pressing a shirt for a round neck you want to take about a business card size and that's where you want to start your first set of letters right here since is a v-neck you know scoops down lower we're not gonna go that far we're gonna go like half the size of a business card I'm sorry I'm gonna make go like half the size of a business card right under that V so that's about an inch and a half so we're gonna scoop this up so that all the letters and I'm gonna show you in a second what I'm talking about so that all of the design fits on here as much as possible so we don't have to double press I'm going to scoot this all the way up so we have more shirt to work with on here as you can see I have the V all the way to the back and right now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and it's not on there yet but I'm gonna go ahead and press this for like mmm six seconds to get the moisture out and I'm not even going to clamp it down that's about six seconds alright and that way oh sorry about that way that way you get the moisture out of the shirt and your letters will stick properly okay I have the vinyl here and in another video I'm going to show you about how to weed how to actually do a design and then print the design and weed the design so anyway I have everything cut out right now since we're just learning about pressing okay this is sticky on this side so what you want to do is make sure there are there's no lint make sure that there are no little specks of vinyl on there either because that will press into your shirt I did that one time and I was able to fix it but you don't want to do that okay so we're gonna put this up kind of near the V okay and Center it and then we're gonna do the rest with all the other letters and I'll come back and show you what it looks like so you just you're just kind of eyeing and measuring if you measure you just kind of iron make sure and everything a centered we're gonna get the design on there ready to press here we are with the letters on and the little designs there's one more design I have to put on and that's gonna be at the bottom of the shirt it could not fit on to the platform so has to be pressed again and as you can see it is centered make sure that your shirt is straight hanging off of there and like I said it's equal on both sides and the middle is where that be point is okay see my tip of my crown is where that B is and I can make sure everything is centered also guys the sticky side is down so you'll know when you come across my other videos when I make how to you know weed them out the sticky side is down so that kind of keeps it from sliding and we're gonna put a Teflon sheet over the design and I can't do it on camera because both hands need to do this so basically what you're gonna do is you're gonna cover this make sure nothing is sliding and because you know it's the sticky side is down it doesn't really slide easy but you're gonna put this over the design evenly while you heat press it so that nothing gets scorched or burned or anything like that and of course now it's all set its preheated it's 315 degrees and that is Fahrenheit of course and we're gonna go ahead and press Teflon placed over the design so nothing scorches ever going to lock it down takes a little muscle to do that alright guys and that first press was just for like four seconds that's a pre press and that is so that the letters adhere to the t-shirt but we're going to take this plastic off because if you don't take the plastic off you know soon enough it gets those you ever seen those indentations or blocks in the shirt around the design like squares or rectangles or whatever around your design that's because of the that plastic has been left on so you want to just get the vinyl adhere to the shirt and you want to take the plastic off and this peels away I'm going to do the rest all right the design is adhere to the shirt so I'm going to go ahead and put the teflon sheet on top and finish pressing it as you see this is glitter and this is glitter know the accent at the bottom is gonna be glitter too Teflon is back on for the second press I'm gonna go ahead oh shoot we'll go ahead and press okay by the time you get the handle down to a certain point I thinks it starts counting so you want to hurry up and click it in but anyway I want to let it go two more seconds because it wasn't really pressing when I was okay now you just yank the handle up and it comes up okay and there we go that is so pretty on a purple shirt white and silver so there we go I'm gonna put where I get my vinyl and everything from down in the description box okay I'm gonna go ahead and put on the other part of the design this is the bottom part for the design of the shirt as you do t-shirts more and more you're gonna come up with little crafty designs that you do in your own that no one else does this little trick here I'm not going to tell you completely but I kind of take scraps from my mind lines that I cut and there are always scraps left over we have to weed out designs and stuff so some of the scraps I use and these are scraps actually and I just use them and make little pretty designs on the shirt to add a little extra oomph and originality to my designs so these do not have the plastic on the back because they were weeded out so you do have to put the Teflon on carefully for that okay as you can see that design is straight on there too you can see through the paper and I am just going to put it on there just for a few seconds I'm sorry like 10 seconds because I've already heated this part of the design so I'm not going to overheat it but I just wanted to get this stuck to the t-shirt and now I'm gonna finish pressing it so it's a good press on there won't come off so I'm going to turn the shirt around so that it's you know may might be included in there and that's okay but I'm gonna go ahead and turn it around there we go turn this shirt around my turn turn the t-shirt around see that's that hanging down so I just want to press the bottom like I said may as include it and that's okay so I'm gonna go ahead and put a press on there and I'm not going to leave it on for the full 15 seconds because it's already been pressed a little bit so give that to that I'm gonna have to give it a pretty hard yank and there we go Oh nicely done and here is the t-shirt Oh nicely done and it's all centered looks very pretty I hope you can see it decently I try to get a picture of it kind of further away in a second but I'm letting it kind of you know just cool off it is a purple shirt with white riding and silver glitter crown silver glitter accents here down at the bottom and this writing is white also so came out very nice alright got another one to press but thanks for watching guys and I'll see you right back here next time on traces please subscribe", "Y2F9EM2ylgg": "a type of t-shirts that I think is super versatile and awesome looking is the box ET some people say that for an alternative air box of a t-shirt it's just a plain old regular t-shirt just size up but it isn't usually the case with this because when you do size up sometimes the - sure it becomes a little too long or the area maybe around the sleeves become too wide and it kind of just loses that look and it just looks like a really really big teacher so I got the reason for this video back when PacSun dropped its fog essentials collection and it had a bunch of those busted t-shirts I had the chance to purchase one of the teachers but it just couldn't justify the hundred dollar price tag for just a t-shirt when I factored in duties and shipping in my search of the cheaper alternative I think I have found in my opinion a awesome buck see fit t-shirt alternative that only costs four dollars and that is the all sell 1301 t-shirt so that my local urban outfitters not too long ago and it happened to stumble across the store selling these all style t-shirts for around $17 I really like the look of the t-shirt the model they used to advertise the old style t-shirt made it look like a busted t-shirt but when it felt a t-shirt material it felt really closely similar to any Gildan t-shirt so I looked into the all self grant and I didn't find out that they basically Harlequin Calvin in which they sell blank apparel like hoodies and other teachers so that's when I thought to myself if urban all parents are selling these basic all sell t-shirts for 17 dollars could I find the wholesale price per t-shirt on a site like wardens or t-shirts FDA I tried t-shirts FDA and black apparel and they didn't carry the all sale brand but luckily wardens did and they also carries the exact t-shirt I'm talking about and they're only charging four dollars for t-shirt so what it is I bought a few t-shirts as you can see behind me right here and the rest of this video will just be me showing you guys the fizz the t-shirt as well as my recommendations for sizings and what not so the t-shirts are a under set cotton and what that means is that if you throw it in the dryer after you wash it it will most definitely shrink to avoid that what I do is I just after you watch it just hang dry it that way it will avoid the maximum shrinkage so the shirts have a pretty thick collar and I think it looks awesome when you're trying to achieve that box to fit look also the way the sleeves are structured they do have a slightly drop shoulder I normally wear mediums for my t-shirts but in order to achieve that box good look I did fess up to a large so my recommendation is to size up one from your regular size for your benefit I also bought an extra-large size but I found that the length was too much on the extra-large and it turned into more of a longline t-shirt having worn the t-shirts customs already economic save $4 it's an awesome t-shirt the ways of the t-shirt is very nice and it drapes just enough but it's also not too heavy in that it reads as a perfect spring t-shirt also if you do decide to layer a hoodie over the shirt where the trigger will pop up under the hoodie it will fray out kind of looking like a skirt it was kind of sit there because of the weight of t-shirt which makes for a really good layer so at the end of the day you are paying four dollars for our t-shirt so you are paying for the quality that you get like the packs on five essentials question they are at that price but for a reason it probably justifies and quality hopefully but if you're like me and you just want to try out that box to fit style but you don't want to pay $80 or hundred dollars for a t-shirt I think the all self 1301 t-shirt is a great alternative so that does it for my review of the all style 1301 t-shirt if you guys have any questions about what size you get or where to find a

walking you through three ways to tie-dye your t-shirt we'll be doing three different methods crumpled shibori and spiral first let's go through everything you'll need gloves to protect your hands an apron or old clothes a tarp or plastic cover fabric dye salt or soda ash dye fixative plastic squeeze bottles large Ziploc bags of container and hot water rubber bands wooden dowel and of course your white t-shirt to begin make sure your t-shirts are clean wash them even if they're new new shirts sometimes have a chemical that keeps the dye from taking properly prepare your dye instructions will vary we use the powder that you mix into hot water which we then transfer it into our plastic squeeze bottle you don't need to put your dye in to squeeze bottles but if you're gonna die a t-shirt multiple colors this is the most accurate way if you're dying with just one color you can dye the shirt in a container full of dyeing you're ready to prep and dye your shirts the first technique is called the crumpled pattern start crumpling the fabric with your fingers keep scrunching the tee until everything is in a crumpled Mound hold the shirt in place with rubber bands the tighter you make it the more patterns you'll get apply the dye using the squeezed models and don't hold back you can really soak the tee flip the shirt over and repeat on the other side if you're using multiple colors liberally apply the different dyes for more vibrant random final result once died seal your t-shirt in the ziplock bag to keep it damp as the die sets and let it sit for six to eight hours [Music] lay your t-shirt flat and set the dowel in the center where you want your spiral to be twist until the t-shirt is a spiral shape find the tee tightly with three rubber bands creating six wedge shapes [Music] apply your colors one by one to the wet shapes for the best results make opposing wedges the same color now flip the spiral fabric over and repeat on the back once died seal the t-shirt in the ziplock bag and let it sit for six to eight hours [Music] roll your t-shirt tightly around a non-absorbent tube we use the paper roll which honestly wasn't the best but it worked secure both ends with rubber bands [Music] tightly scrunch both ends of the Roll t-shirt towards the center you can also secure rubber bands along the entire tube applied to the fabric rotating the tube is necessary once died seal the t-shirt in a ziplock bag and let it sit for six to eight hours [Music] final steps once you've got your t-shirts sit for a while prepare the dye fixative by mixing it with warm water you'll want the water to be between 100 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit soak the t-shirts in the fixative the exact time they'll need to soak varies based on the type of fixative so check the packaging after soaking the t-shirts rinse them in cold water you can use some light detergent if you want finally leave the shirts to air dry one important thing wash your tie-dyed shirt on its own the first time you put it in the machine to avoid the die bleeding onto other clothes and that was our quick and easy guide on how to tie down [Applause] be sure to LIKE comment and subscribe for more curated

channels and I've done a lot of research and I've done this before a bunch so what I've done is I've taken different elements from different things that people have done I've tried them all and mix it up and made my own deal basically yeah just got to do everything that they do and put it all into one that's what I did so it doesn't work that well on a really stiff t-shirt those really crazy crazy 100% cotton shirts that basically can stand up on their own doesn't work that well on them but about five or six of my other shirts came out amazing sometimes you got to go through the cycle twice even three times but to get a two just properly distress a shirt for most shirts it's gonna work pretty good so let me know in the comments below let me know you think if you like my channel please subscribe [Music] warning the time wasted watching this video is non-refundable [Music] next episode is the full episode a week with Donnie this is a tutorial episodes it's a small one just a little episode I don't want to I'm not gonna put any Trevor cartoons on this so maybe I might put a little one in there but because people want to see tutorials according to my friends people want to see tutorials so I'm gonna do a tutorial they want to see more Donnie I want to see more of you doing art making things doing crafts today is a tutorial on how to de-stress your t-shirts so this bag of salt was about $5 at the nursery basically Home Depot has these and check this out so I got a bunch of my shirts in here and this is phase 1 phase 1 is in salt water so I got salt water about five days I'm taking out right now and I'm gonna be Phase two [Music] okay so first one is my heavy-metal shirts and this was already like a soft t-shirt so the system worked really well in this this is really really super soft of course it was already soft so that was I was kind of a no-brainer the second one was skinny Jimmy's shirt the design with my friend Ken this worked really well too this shirt was um was a pretty standard t-shirt it wasn't a super heavy shirt but it wasn't a like a softie so now it's a softie and system worked on this great this was a hard team this t-shirt was pretty hard Atari Matt to some music for Donnie TV and and I've done an episode on him he's amazing and I really want to wear a shirt nah the system worked really good on this this I ran through twice I ran through this the system two times and now it's perfect I love it this I ran through the system three times this was this was a regular 100% cotton shirt as well and it just was really really really rough it was a heavy one so I'm gonna Hugh I'm gonna use the Puma stone on this King gizzard and the lizard wizard t-shirt I really want to wear it [Music] [Music] again do this at your own risk don't destroy your t-shirts don't get holes in your shirts just be careful I'm not a hundred percent sure how good it is for your shirt to leave it in vinegar and salt for a few days or a day or however long you want to leave it in for but anyways I found that this system works on a really heavy shirts it's just it just really doesn't work that well but you can get some of that starchy feeling out of it anyways good luck let me know you think if you like the channel subscribe and like leave a comment below thank you for watching mm-hmm distress some shirts man [Music] [Music] it is [Music]", "KgAgKwf641A": "hey guys Adam here from DOS information supplies and today we're going to talk about printing designs onto t-shirts and other garments and what paper to use for what items and I'm going to assume that you've got a dye sublimation printer using dye sublimation inks or either a reco and maybe the superjet are inks are one of the Epsons with the sublimation ink okay and the first paper I want to talk about today time is the standard dye sublimation transfer paper now everybody knows that realistically you're looking at polyester garments anything with a hundred percent polyester well you can't print anything out I tend to go anything over sixty percent polyester you should get a reasonable resort but try and get as close to a hundred percent as you can with this paper the reason being that the ink needs a polymer to bond to and however having said that when you do have the hundred percent polyester the results you get from this paper is absolutely brilliant and obviously there are lots of different types of this paper on the market this is just the one that we use here for all our sublimation is the jet stream digital f-35 paper it's a really nice balance of price and quality and but again you know there are a lot of options alright now the downside to using your standard dye sublimation paper is that you can only use it on man-made fabrics also you can't print anything dark with the ink being transparent em it won't show up on a dark surface the other thing that kind of stops you printing on dark with these that your printer isn't printing white and it will print CMYK but not white so if you want to put a white design onto a black t-shirt for example which is really popular you know bands and stag do that kind of thing you can't you can't do as it's not pretty in white there's no ink to transfer it just leaves the white blank okay however there are options that you can choose for for the situations so you want to print white cotton t-shirts for example or any other sort of natural fabric you could look at something like this this is the Reva media transfer paper for light garments now this is the one I use for light stuff if it's cotton or you know any other sort of natural fabric basically what it does is it has a transfer layer on top of the paper so you print your design out onto the paper well you mirror the design onto the paper lay the paper facedown well you'd cut your design out actually because the whole paper will transfer in the heat press so you need to cut your design out late design face down and close the press it takes about 25 seconds and the surface of the paper is an adhesive and we'll add ear to the garment you then peel back the backing paper revealing the design that's then bonded to the material fantastic for light cotton garments things like that absolutely brilliant and it is compatible with a cameo custom as well or any other form of cutter so you can really accurately cook those designs out if you need to but it's also really easy to cut by hand for your dark and for dark t-shirts cotton t-shirts I kind of think cotton I use this which is the equivalent dark transfer paper this is the river media dark transfer paper now these come in a Falls irrelevant 100 sheets per Park and they do the arc the arc they're not the cheapest thing in the world but the quality is absolutely brilliant so it's it's worth it it's worth it's worth the price tug basically the way this works is slightly different you don't want to mirror your design on the dark paper it put your printed the right way up because what you're going to do is you're going to peel you're going to cut it out and peel it away like a transfer lay it on the garment and then heat press it the back of the transfer layer on this paper has a heat activated adhesive which then bonds permanently with the material underneath and there is also absolutely brilliant both of these also provide that white because the the transfer itself is white you can have white text and things using using this paper without having to print white sideral don't need an Okie or anything like that you can do with this transfer paper and both of them have a little bit of a hand to them when they're on the when they're on the material but it's not it there's very very little it so it doesn't stick out a long way like some of the vinyl which is a nice effect but this is very smooth to the fab it feels quite natural when you're wearing it and things like that they also withstand washing really well recently with the dark fabric transfer actually just as a test I did a jumper and I probe it to my partner who has been sleeping in it and washing it and we've we've really really arrived about and it looks really well I'll stick a photograph of that jumper at the end of this video so you can see what I mean but it has been them it has been washed pretty thoroughly because I don't think she's ever read a garment care label in our life but that's just me alright guys the other thing with these two is they can actually be applied to the heat a standard household iron I am going to look at doing a video on how to do that in the in the future I'll show you how to do that but I can send the instructions to anybody who wants that so yeah so you don't actually have to have a flat press to apply those transfers to you to your garment well I hope that's helped and I hope I felt clear some things up obviously are different variations of this available these are the ones I would use I've tested quite a few of them and these the ones that I found I got the best results with yeah that's it from me today I hope that's cleared some things up here's a question I get quite a lot kind of printing a black cotton t-shirt with my sublimation paper and if you've got any questions get them in the comment section below or email me director Adam at dye sublimation supplies coda UK and I'll do my best to answer any

i think there is one field in particular whereby every possible measurement i am the leading expert without equal i'm of course talking about white t-shirts when it comes to white t-shirts i'm the [ __ ] jeff bezos i am i'm like the judge dread of white t-shirts i am the law and i'm constantly hounded by fashion icons and popular fashion magazines like vogue you know charlie what are you wearing today please share with us charlie we're not worthy but what are you wearing and the answer is always the same it's a white t-shirt baby i've been wearing white t-shirts almost daily since high school since like my sophomore year high school so over 10 years now which is extremely sad and pathetic to say out loud but it's the truth and i can say with a high level of certainty that i'm probably the only man in the world that can make that claim been wearing daily white t-shirts for over a decade now so that means i'm the only one qualified to give an accurate tier list for white t-shirts all the white t-shirts you're gonna see today are ones i found at walmart because that's where i get like all my [ __ ] white t-shirts from i can get like six of these for a quarter so i just decided to go raid walmart and find all their white t-shirts and put them to the ultimate test with the only white t-shirt connoisseur me right here this monstrous [ __ ] meat ball of muscle nice that felt powerful

washer and dryer so it's in fine condition it looks absolutely wonderful the comfort is off the charts it feels like you're being coddled by an angel the gildan fabric is one that's my personal favorite and my daily white t-shirt i don't typically branch out from the gildan unless i have a special occasion so gildan for me comfortably sits at an s tier just because it's so reliable it's so consistent you know you know exactly we're getting into with the gildan white t-shirts and now we've reached that magical moment where it's time to talk about one of the most well-known properties in

fit actually boys this is a children's large this actually might be like my ideal size that hugs your chest nicely yeah i feel like really strong you might burst out of it at any moment why we also have a couple other kids sections selections such as wonder nation nice i'm excited for that one this right here was from the polo fall catalog white t-shirt collection and after spending a little bit of time with the polo white t-shirt children's large i have to say it's a pretty solid shirt it's you know there's nothing offensive about it it's just it's just pretty forgettable i have to say it's nothing that you'll wear and be like holy lord i feel like a million bucks it's something you'll put on be like yup that feels like a white t-shirt and for that reason i'm gonna have to comfortably sit the polo white t-shirt at a b-tier rating i would just expect a little bit more because this was like a seven dollar white t-shirt for seven dollars i could own the entire gildan brand of white t-shirt so i was really shelling out big bucks for the polo and was expecting big things but didn't find those big things no boundaries there's a lot of room to grow in this shirt and the pocket kind of sags real low like grandma's titties down here that one's pretty see-through is it i can see all of your tattoos right through it no boundaries more like no chance of me wearing this out in public i mean just an embarrassing white t-shirt really i don't like shirts with a pocket like that and especially not a pocket of that size that pocket was big enough to put like a small golf cart in i don't know why you'd need a shirt pocket that huge unless you're trying to like hide a human being inside of it it was absolutely disgusting the fabric wasn't even comfortable it felt like construction paper it was way too big but that's because i bought from the adult section and well there's just there was no chance that i was ever going to enjoy this shirt but i decided to at least give it a try they didn't have like an adult small which i can fit into this was like adults large or extra large don't remember just not a great shirt really not at all i'm gonna have to put this one at definitely an f tier fruit of the loom platinum oh boy that's a nice one my least favorite brand but i've never tried their platinum selection awfully bougie this comes with dual defense technology working a wicking and odor protection what is wicking like moisture whipping ricks it off your body keeps you dry okay boys i can really feel that dual defense technology kicking in you look dry yeah i smelled like a bag of dog [ __ ] before putting this on but now i smell like roses that one's also pretty see-through is it like i i know i know your tattoos are black ink but i feel like i should have been able to see it up through yours yeah but actually this is kind of nice fabric it feels like really flimsy though like i feel like if i just get like one tug here like the whole thing's going up just rip that one off i actually feel like i could yeah you're getting oh yeah i didn't even put a lot of force behind that just just rip it off we're ready for the next one i just ripped so much of my hair as i mentioned fruity loom is probably one of my least favorite brands it's like wearing a handkerchief if it was covered in broken glass i really don't like fruit of the looms fabric at all but this was from their platinum selection which i had never tested before and i do have to say they upgraded the fabric on this it felt much better than i was used to with old fruit of the looms the only real critique i have is how flimsy it is as you saw two big tugs in the entire thing was completely kaput it was [ __ ] you know if you're using this for like sportswear if you're playing like defense on basketball and someone goes up to like you know dunk over you you're they're ripping your entire shirt into shreds it's going to get vaporized because it just doesn't have any durability to it so for that reason through the loom platinum i'm putting at a c tier i would expect a little bit more fruit of the wound platinum not important just to get a full comparison you're gonna have fruit of the loom not platinum okay that's gonna fall apart before it's just part of the loom just really uncomfortable fabric it's like a bunch of sandpaper reminds me of tracing paper yeah it's terrible i could definitely trace your tattoos too that was nice it feels like one ply toilet paper it looks like the torso is far too long for the arm length yeah absolutely yeah it's just a terribly made shirt it's great for your arms and my torso fruit of the loom should just be out of business terrible the platinum selection at least a little more comfortable just a bit flimsy yeah as expected classic fruit of the loom is just absolutely abominable there is nothing redeeming about it if you were trapped in a really cold environment with only one option for clothing and it being fruit of the loom you're better off freezing to death it would be more comfortable than wearing the fruit of the loom t-shirts so for that reason that's going to be enough tier here's here's one that i've never even heard of but it to my untrained eye feels pretty nice this is wonder nation did you want to rip another no i hurt myself the reason you haven't heard of this matthew is because you don't have children this is a child's brand yeah i would do it yeah it's walmart's child's brand i had a little battle getting that over my hulking muscularity but i feel like it's a nice fit that's a good one yeah wow wait wait show us the back again and give us a little like lap flex oh that's ripping see if you can burst out of it like the whole i'll just try and like flex it off more like i wonder how i got this strong you look massive in that shirt yeah this is an s tier can i try that one out those shirt is gonna look really fast does that mean you actually got it on oh yeah oh my man you look like a psychopath that wouldn't be allowed near like that of my arms it's part of the wonder nation anything you could burst out of that no i mean it's a nice fabric i'll give it to him dude i feel huge in this shirt oh my god like a maniac yeah you would be banned near every elementary school it's a nice fabric now all right it's got like barbed wire in the clutch really sharp [Laughter] all right i give up unfortunately wonder nation failed the ballistics test failing or passing that's pretty good the wonder nation children's medium shirt was actually surprisingly comfortable as well as coming with like a plus five self-esteem booster to it because it's so tight it compacts everything and just makes you look like a [ __ ] man so yeah i mean wonder nation i'm actually gonna give like a comfortable eight here as tears being a little generous because it is so tight it's like wearing a woman's corset it's good it's to be a bit hard to breathe if you're wearing it for an extended period of time but for that like short 30 minutes that you have before you pass out or asphyxiate yourself wearing the shirt you're gonna look great in it it just it really just makes you look good and feels good you feel like confident yeah i just don't like v-necks i just don't this doesn't work for me it's a great fabric absolutely won't fault him on that but i just don't understand v-necks is that the most see-through at the top for sure yeah so i can see something like that there's nicer fabric than the others but i can like that's the most i've seen your tattoo through a shirt yeah absolutely that's been every shirt so far so that's good that's part of the the good thing about white t-shirts yeah yeah yeah haynes premium are extremely comfortable i knew that going into it i'm no stranger to haynes premium this definitely was not my first rodeo however however i am pretty unfamiliar with v-necks i've only worn a couple of them in my life the last time being back in like early high school late middle school when i was like 160 pounds like four foot five and i thought fedoras and studded bracelets were cool so a v-neck wasn't necessarily going to be the ideal shirt to wear with that combination of all those factors but honestly as i wore the v-neck around today it really started to grow on me i really started to warm up to the v-necks design honestly i'm going to give haynes premiums v-neck here a nice comfortable a-tier rating it's literally called athletic works dry fit perfect there you go it's not the worst thing in the world but it's not overly comfortable either what that one's the most seat yeah you were gildan right yeah so your shirt so far is the only one i can't just see straight through oh nice like this one this one looks like it could be a fishnet like shirt on this one it kind of feels like it yeah i really don't get the design i guess it's for like sweaty old men maybe but i just don't get it it's not comfortable it doesn't feel like awfully able to breathe you know and then you're right that's definitely an old man yeah like working out at the ymca the ones you see blow drying your balls in the locker room usually i'm not sure more like athletics doesn't work because this shirt [ __ ] sucked i was not really a fan first impressions were far more positive because putting it on and only walking around doing a small 360 to show it off it didn't really really start to dawn on me how uncomfortable the shirt was it's just the design is not conducive to human skin it really gets very grating it just it feels gross it's like wearing little grains of rice across your body i just didn't like it so i'm giving the dry fit athletic works a deter rating maybe if you're like absolutely [ __ ] drenched in sweat it does a good job of not letting that sweat bother you by distracting you with how uncomfortable the shirt itself is i mean i really don't know the dry fit was not for me all right it's just called george this is george's white t-shirt they're multiple-sided like no they're all that's a big smallest there's a rather large small but you know george i don't have a whole lot to say about george pretty inoffensive feels all right not the best not the worst i could i could tailor that and it would fit you guys yeah it's a little big for small right yeah but like it fits you well oh wow that looks good wow george should hire you this is pretty fantastic design actually before matt tortured the george white t-shirt and shoved it through the [ __ ] shredder here it actually fit very well i thought and was very comfortable i granted the torso was a little long for a small unless it's trying to like fit on slenderman or something it was a little disproportionate but the actual shirt itself was nothing but quality george really has outdone himself again with this excellent feeling fabric that they've created here in their laboratory they just need to work on their dimensions of the shirt i would say so i'm just going to give george a b-tier rating so yeah that's uh that's about it for this white t-shirt tier list see ya", "zCD_bssV4ak": "how's it going everyone we think it's really important that people think about wear clothing comes from and how it's made so today we're in India and we're going to go and meet some of the people that grow the organic cotton that gets turned into our t-shirts [Music] so here at Agena factory which is where cotton gets separated out with a usable part of fiber loaded so the guys are showing us here the end product of this process where the cotton seeds are pressed and this is what we end up with and it's used to feed cows [Music] [Music] completely closed the water recycling facility so the guys will eat drink [Music] when you make cotton about two percent of the material in the spinning factory ends up on the floor so we're going to go look around and see how this cotton waste we turn it to paper and that's the kind of paper we use in a packaging there for us [Music] what's amazing about that if it that's just high-quality is any other part that I've ever seen and it's just cotton and water when Perez arrived with us they're stored in a factory on the Isle of Wight and here for us are made in real time that means the printed in the seconds after their orders and because of that there isn't any waste [Music] this is the last stage in the process we're finished products are sent out to our customers but it's not the end of the journey because every product we make is designed to be sent back to us when it's worn out and we pay that material and ream manufacturer into new products that can be worn again new products like this remanufactured t-shirt that I've worn throughout the journey", "0X-HfUmGtk4": "What\u2019s up

Every time I made videos on T-shirt\nprinting you liked it very much.. ..and I always try to bring you\nan easy, simple and new technique.. ..that you can use to\nprint T-shirts at home easily. I feel those techniques\nare pretty easy.. ..yet I have noticed people\nsaying in the comments section.. ..that it would take\nvery long to do this.. ..or that I don't have\nmaterials to make this.. ..or can you tell us of\nan easier technique than this. Guess what.\nI have the world's easiest technique.. ..which I am going to\ntell you and I guarantee you.. ..anybody can print a T-shirt\nat home using this technique. Look, I do so much for you, so, it\nis your duty to do something for me. Do you see a subscribe\nbutton like this one down below? Click on it and\nsubscribe to my channel.. ..if you haven't done so as yet. And if you have done it, don't forget to click\non the bell notification.. ..so that you know every\ntime my new video is out. Also, here are my instagram handles. You can follow me here as well.. ..so you get daily updates.. ..about the things going\non in my daily life or my work. Alright? Shall we begin? Then get ready,\nit's time for some DIY. Why? Because I love it. I am going to show you the easiest\nprinting technique in the world.. ..which we will\ncomplete in three steps. Step one is that you need an image. You can use your phone\nor laptop to choose an image.. ..or you could make an\nimage as I have done over here.. ..using photo editing or by\nusing a jacket design software or app. My image is Happiest in Goa. I made this image as it best\ndescribes my mood of feeling.. ..and I want to wear this on my chest. You can make a print\nof things that you like.. ..or download an image similar to it. The print is here.\nI will simply cut it. All I need is this square design.\nThe size does not matter. You can print any size\nbig or small with this technique. Okay. So, my cutout is ready. Now we can move to step two. In step two we shall\nuse our special material. This is cling wrap or cling film. Basically,\nthis is a thin plastic film or sheet.. ..which we use to wrap foods such\nas sandwiches, salads and fruits.. ..so they remain fresh. We have to use this to\ncompletely wrap our print.. ..that is to say,\nwe have to cover it for printing. So, let's do that. Now I shall take a\nbig piece of cling wrap.. ..place my print on top of\nit and cover it with the cling wrap. Like this. But please ensure\nit does not have any wrinkles. We shall stretch it\nand spread it nicely.. ..and cut off the extra bit.\nJust like this. Make sure there are\nno wrinkles at all. If you see any wrinkles, you\npull it again and remove the wrinkles. Once you have stretched it,\nyou just flip it.. ..and fold it inwards instead\nof cutting it. Just like this. The cling wrap sticks on to it.\nLike that. This way your edges will be clean. I am folding all the\nsides inwards like this. In a way this is similar\nto the lamination technique. I have applied a plastic layer\nor film in front and at the back. When I iron this on to the T-shirt,\nthe plastic will melt.. ..and stick to the T-shirt.\nTo further strengthen this bond.. ..I shall cut some\nmore pieces of cling wrap.. ..and stick it to\nthe back of the print.. ..so that it acts like glue\nand easily stick to the T-shirt. Okay. With this done we\ncan move towards our third step. Let's bring in the T-shirt. Here's our T-shirt.\nThis is a plain black cotton T-shirt.. ..which I have ironed\nproperly so it is wrinkle free. In this case,\nI am using a new T-shirt.. ..but you could recycle\nyour old T-shirt if you wish. I am going to print it in this spot.\nLet's bring in the print. Here's my Happiest in Goa print. Now I shall align it correctly. Once the position is aligned,\nwe will lay butter paper on it. Butter paper is a glossy shiny paper.\nIt is also called wax paper. You can avail of it\nat any stationary store.. ..or places that sell baking tools. Okay. After laying\nthe butter paper on it.. ..I shall iron this with a hot iron. Here's the iron.\nNow we must iron it carefully.. ..so that all the plastic melts and\nour print gets stuck to the T-shirt. The ironing is done.\nNow let's peel off the butter paper.. ..to see if our print is stuck. You must be careful and if possible,\nlet it cool down a little. After that you can peel it off. Okay. I waited for 5 to 10 minutes.\nIt is completely cool now. Now I shall slowly\npeel the butter paper. As you can clearly see, the butter paper is stuck a little.. ..but it is peeling off slowly.. ..and our print is\nstuck well to the T-shirt. There you go. As you can see, our\nprint is stuck nicely to the T-shirt. Look at that. Pretty cool, right? Like I said,\nthe technique is extremely easy.. ..and I was pretty careful. I used similar pressure all\nover on low heat to stick it nicely.. It is slightly untidy at the corners. The cling wrap is\nstill unglued over here. Similarly it is gone\na little crooked over here. You must take a little care.\nThe iron was excessively hot.. ..which caused the\ncolor to fade a little. But it's okay.\nIt has a slightly distressed look.. ..but overall I'm very\nhappy with the print.. ..and it stuck to\nthe T-shirt very easily. With that my T-shirt is ready.\nLet's try it out. You see? Didn't I tell you\nthis is the world's easiest technique? And you can print anything\nyou want on your T-shirt with this. But bear in mind, you cannot\nwash it in the washing machine. It has to be hand washed\nand you must do it gently. It is possible if you use\nextra pressure or brush it hard.. ..the print could peel off. You have no reason to worry though. You can easily fix it. If you apply cling wrap\non the spot which has peeled off.. ..and iron it, it will be reaffixed. It's that easy. I know that many people will\nwrite in the comments section.. ..this will come\noff when it is washed. The color is faded. It won't\nlook good. The finishing is not good. I wish to tell all them. Think about\nit, guys. You made this yourself. It's handmade. It's unique. Quite possibly you will not find the\nprint you made or stuck anywhere else. One of its kind. Maybe the durability or\nthe finishing does not match.. ..the product you buy in the market.. ..which is made using a machine\nin a factory. It is okay, guys. I taught you a technique\nwhich you can use to reaffix.. ..even if it gets spoiled a little\nor you could make it all over again. Not just one design.\nYou can make many kinds of designs. So, it's good to learn\nnew things and try new things. If you just sit there commenting,\nit won't work. Try new things. So,\nI encourage you to try making this. It's super simple. I really hope you guys\nenjoyed watching the video.. ..and found this tutorial helpful. Give me a big like if you value it.\nShare the video with your friends. And if you make it, you must\nclick pictures and share them with me. These are my instagram handles. You can post them to me here\nand tag me. I too will watch them. And if you haven't subscribed\nto my channel as yet.. ..please subscribe now\nand leave a nice comment.. ..so it makes me feel good. See you.\nTill then, do good and be good. Peace.", "3DTegwqbJ6M": "hey guys how you doing this is home with liberty graphic designs i'm gonna make a really quick video on sublimation so don't go anywhere [Music] okay so i always say i'm gonna make a quick video right and end up ends up being like 20 minutes but i'm gonna try to keep it very short and uh like you guys know on my video sometimes i put a lot of information this is not gonna be one of those videos so okay so one of the things about sublimation it has to be 100 polyester though you can use some blends like for example 65 um uh yeah 65 35 right and you'll get like a vintage kind of look but um a lot of whenever we do sublimation we always stick to why well i'm going to be sublimating this fluorescent orange and then we're going to be doing some other colors obviously this is not white right but there's colors that we can use on this one like for example black blues reds you know stuff like that colors uh um dark color colors like that can be sublimated on this type of shirts so let me show you first uh how to do your uh like regular vinyl right on 100 polyester and and then we'll go from regular vinyl hdv uh to sublimation okay so i have a sheet right here and this is sublimation paper as you can see it's pretty big i just printed this it's 24 by 24 uh using the epson f570 so i'm gonna cut my artwork okay so the first one we're gonna make is gonna be this um fluorescent orange uh a jersey or shirt and this is gonna be actually all this i'm going to make like three different shirts i think it's three different shirts a lot of these are a friend of mine not for the same friend right but they're all they're all very good friends of mine so it's gonna be a like say for example a construction construction uh company this is all we need we don't need a bag i'm sorry we don't need a pillow okay so this is all we need you don't need a pillow for this because you're not going over any seams a lot of people will put the color on this side so you don't print it that's that's a really good idea me i don't care so i'm going to press this for one minute 60 seconds and i have other settings in here everybody prints with different settings i have my settings i have everything everything dialed in the way that i want it again everybody prints like for example they'll say 400 for 60 seconds or uh you know 425 for x amount of seconds me i got my own settings and i'm gonna keep those two myself so there you go that's the front and look at that that one's done and this is what it looks like dang it it's hot that's what it looks like it's nice and dark i mean it's really really black so again those are settings that i already already been playing with um and i printed this on an epson f570 so now we're going to do the back and the back is same same thing and you guys are going to ask yourselves juan you don't use a uh t-square no i don't use a t-square there you go that's the back and you see how dark it looks i mean dang it it's hot it's like really hot but look at how dark that is i mean that's like a true black i mean that thing is it's like it's really really black it's amazing right it looks really really good well you're gonna be like well it's a bright color yeah it is look at that it looks really really good so on this t-shirts right here there's no need to make a screen to screen print it none whatsoever you can use sublimation now let's move over to something a little more challenging black it's a black t-shirt and let me show you against this black t-shirt this is 100 polyester i'm going to show you against the t-shirt so you can see how dark my black my black is you see that you see how dark i am on the uh on the sublimation yep it looks really good okay so now on this one 100 poly no i'm not gonna use sublimation so for something like this if you guys have any sublime any uh polyester shirts like this you know you cannot sublimate black so for that we are going to use regular vinyl you're probably going to be asking why are you using vinyl you can screen print it well the reason why is because this is just one shirt that's the reason why i'm using vinyl so all i got to do on this one change my settings because i don't want to i don't want to heat press it for one minute so that's it peel it hot and then i just give it about three seconds without the uh without the the uh what they call it the carrier i'm not going to touch it because it's like super hot so there you go and by doing that that you know five seconds it really pushes the the uh what they call it the vinyl back into the fabric and notice how my shirts i'm not burning my shirts you see that sometimes when we saw blue maid you can see the part where you actually burn the shirt okay so now we're gonna move into yet another shirt and the next one is gonna be this charcoal gray so charcoal gray let's see what happens with the sublimation and the reason why i'm doing this video guys is so you guys can get an idea on how dark you can get sublimation to work so we're going to take our sublimation on a dark gray shirt so a lot of you is going to say it's not going to work because sublimation is supposed to work only on white t-shirts or light colors let me change my settings okay so let's see if our dark um garment worked look at that you see that so a lot of people will say somebody mentioned dang it that's hot it's like really hot a lot of people will tell you sublimation only works on white t-shirts no it does not depending on your settings and how good your you know your printer is this is how good you can make it look so let's throw a logo on the front just to kind of finish that shirt and then after i do this logo i'm going to show you something real quick [Music] also notice when i lower my press i went real slow when you're doing sublimation you want to go real slow if you don't if you didn't apply adhesive or put a heat tape on it you want to you want to lower your press real slow because if you if you bring it down too fast the wind uh that you create by pushing it down can move the artwork and that's the front of the shirt and you can see it's nice and dark really hot too see that so this is a very dark shirt and yeah you can still make it work okay so the next shirt we're gonna make is gonna be this um gray one and the color and this one is actually silver that's the color on this one silver and this one we're going to do a number and do a number on this one um this is a jersey for like a soccer team okay so except for the number and on this numbers this is really cool because on the number i even in i even did the logo of the team um so that's what it would look like on a gray shirt and it actually looks it looks really good okay so but one thing i wanted to show you and i'm gonna show you on this red one is this one's right here they get a logo on the sleeve so a couple of things you got to do on the sleeve if you're going to do a logo on the sleeve do it where the sleeve is actually folded just like that like it is and then put it right there or whatever is going to go right in this case it has to be right in the center of the of the sleeve well if we do that so usually stick your hand inside so you can get it right in the center and then you follow the crease right see that crease okay so when you're working with uh something like that it has seams i'm actually where i'm where i'm placing the the print there's no seam but the seam is on the other side so what you want to do is you use a piece of foam any foam would do just make sure that you put a piece of teflon teflon sheet on top of it so it will be something like this so you will put your sure like that right and see right now the crease or the seam i'm sorry the seam is right here and there's the crease so that that's the center of the shirt now if you put a piece of foam in there the this right here will sink into the foam and you can you can go ahead and sublimate it and you won't have a problem but if you sublimate it directly on the planet the blonde there's not going to be any room for that for the um the song part to go anywhere and you're going to ruin the shirt it's not going to sublimate um it's not going to sublimate properly the best way to do that is if you get a pillow but if you don't have a pillow and this is one of those heat press uh pillows so if you don't have a pillow you can go to walmart um hobby lobby uh joanne's or whatever where they sell a foam and you can buy a piece of foam that would be the cheapest way however if you're gonna go this route i suggest you put a piece of a teflon sheet parchment paper any type of paper to protect the foam from getting sublimation into the foam uh it doesn't matter if you get sublimation on the foam right you can throw it away but if you get sublimation on the foam or any type of um ink on the foam it's going to transfer over to the to the next garment so this is what it's gonna look like okay so if you use a foam make sure that you adjust your pressure because now uh you added a foam this thing is not gonna close see it just won't close so adjust your pressure try it and um and then go from there i already lost my my little crease make sure you put it upside down and now we can sublimate the sleeve there you go sublimate it using a regular piece of foam and you're gonna probably ask yourself oh you're gonna probably say juan you said to use to cover the phone yeah but if you notice i'm only using that little part right there so there's no way that the ink can get over there but just to be on the safe side make sure you use something to cover that foam you see everything is sublimated then this thing this thing is hot so so look at that i mean you can actually tell where the the sewn part was or the seam you can see where this the seam was right there i can actually see it but if you notice everything sublimated correctly so by using a piece of foam you can um you can get away from you know so um from these uh seams right here just by using a little uh cheap piece of foam one thing i forgot to mention guys uh when you're doing multiple shirts this is some sublimation okay so as you can see i went and got another shirt but one thing is very important that you do is make sure you put a protective piece of paper like on the other ones you didn't see me using that but i'm gonna show you real quick because uh sometimes the when you're doing the sublimation sometimes when you're doing the sublimation this is sublimation paper right sublimation will actually bleed through depending on what kind of settings you're using on your paper and what kind of paper you're using so it'll bleed through the paper and actually stain the uh um what do you call this the teflon the teflon sheet and then when you go to apply an or when you go to supplement another shirt or garment whatever it is you're using or sublimating masks t-shirts whatever you're sublimating that image is going to be imprinted on your teflon sheet and you can actually stain the other shirt or whatever it is you're using so i'm going to show you real quick uh what i mean by that because i didn't explain that on the video i was about to edit the video and i was like let me let me fix this real quick so let me show you real quick what i'm talking about okay okay so we're going to do this shirt right let's say for example on this one we're going to do the number this one's going to be number four so i've been doing this for a while if you guys if you guys don't feel comfortable just placing the the number or whatever it is you're gonna sublimate like that uh use a ruler so you're straight i've been doing this for a while so well i i don't use that anymore but this is what i'm talking about grab a piece of butcher paper uh even regular paper will work um let me fix this right so it doesn't slide on me this is what i say i'm look i'm in the market for another heat press because i like to thread my my shirts and this one i can't thread them so if i was to thread it see you know i'll be stretching the the shirt because it's already hidden at the bottom so that's what it means by threading a shard is is where you can put it inside the machine so that's why i'm i'm in the market for another heat press so okay so going back in this right so um several ways of finding your center you know you can fold it in half just make sure that your uh that your edge to edge but in this case we're just going to put it about right there and then the position and the numbers you want to leave enough space just in case they want to come back and say can you add a name so if you put your name your numbers up too high you're not going to be able to add a name in the top you're going to have to do it at the bottom so i usually i usually place my num my numbers about six inches from the color down um that's where it's going to go so and then this is what i was saying put a piece of parchment paper a piece of butcher paper even regular paper however this paper that you're gonna put in here has to go in the trash after you use it and i'll show you what i mean okay so now this is what i'm talking about um i know you're not probably not going to be able to see it on camera maybe you can but there's a very let me get this out of here um so there's a number right number four and what i was telling you about it'll bleed through the number or through the paper um depending on your settings so i don't know if you can see it but there's a very faint uh image in there of the number well if you don't if you don't protect your your heat press that will bleed through and you you're going to put an image on your um on your heat press or your teflon sheet and then when you go to when you go to press the other one you're going to have like for example not all the shirts are gonna be number four but i say for example we'll go to number five you're gonna have the number five and you're gonna still see the number four in there um trust me uh right here you can hardly see it but when you press a shirt and watch i'm gonna show you just so you can see it let me see if i can put a print um i have this material here this is what we use for some of the mask this is white so we're going to try to see if we can get that number to sublimate because you're going to be able to see it on the white print better than you can on this piece of paper so this is just replicating let's say for example you put another shirt in there um like for example the number five or number three whatever you know okay and after you use this paper pla make sure you throw it away um this is pretty cool it actually cleaned the ink that was in this paper it actually took it i mean it completely cleaned the the ink that's pretty cool yeah because i can't even see anything anymore but if we look at our print again it's very light but it's right there again i don't know how good you can see that on the on the uh on the video but it's right there i can see the number four right there it's going right there over here again you can hardly see it but if you're doing multiple shirts that's gonna get uh brighter and brighter and brighter and then you're gonna ruin a shirt okay so again i forgot to uh to show you this i forgot to tell you about putting a piece of uh a lot of people use butcher butcher paper um perfectly fine whatever paper you want to use uh if butcher paper is too expensive you can just buy a rim that's what i call it right a rim of paper regular printer paper and then just put it on top to protect the the heat press or the teflon sheet that you're gonna put in there that way if you transfer anything onto the the um not only the shirt but to whatever you're protecting you can throw this away and measure you can only use this once so use it once and throw it away get get rid of it don't use it again because you'll see how it actually um and this one you can hardly see it see this one i couldn't even i can't even see it but even though you cannot see it trust me you want to get rid of it just in case if there is residue of uh adhesive in there i'm sorry not adhesive of sublimation ink in there again depending on what your settings are and what i mean by settings is what how much ink you actually actually deposit on the sublimation paper i like to do a little extra myself because you get better prints that way so so yeah make sure you use some sort of paper so you protect your heat press so i forgot to put that on the on the regular video that's why i came back i didn't finish editing the editing the video so i came back and redid this one so you guys uh can see what i'm talking about okay now also on the other video i didn't show you uh how i was doing the sponsor and everything so let me show you real quick so it's really it's really easy for you to mess it up once you uh line up everything say for example that's where it's gonna go when you lower this if you lower it too fast did you see that how that one moved so that's what i'm saying be careful you can add adhesive just regular adhesive you don't have to go buy that expensive pro spray that you know you can buy of i don't know i can't even remember the johnson plastics i think sell some on a lot of people sell those you know pro sprays this is regular spray adhesive that we use for screen printing you can use this just spray a little bit so just enough so it'll stick wherever you want it to be at now even if i move the shirt that's not going to move well flip it over it will right um but that has enough enough adhesive for the for the graphics to stay on and it won't mess it up trust me the adhesive will not transfer it'll it won't stay on the shirt and it's just a little bit i mean i just sprayed a little bit so yeah you so you want to apply just a little bit of adhesive so the the um what do you call it the print doesn't move and then don't forget to put your paper on it because remember the reason why we put in the paper is so it doesn't transfer onto the heat press and that's it remember we grab this piece of paper and again on this one i don't see any transfer but even though even though you don't see anything get rid of it because there could be something there that you don't see because i literally don't see any any transfer on there but we're gonna throw it away and as you can see if you add adhesive to it um the adhesive completely leads to i mean it won't you won't have any residue and you don't have to use none of that you know pro spray that they sell and that's it now remove that shirt okay now if you do happen to transfer some ink into the teflon sheet either the bottom or the top one keep one of these bottles handy uh this is just a degreaser and what i do is i take one of my whole shirts and as you can see it's all orange so spray a little bit in there just like that this is just in case if you did transfer some and clean it and just clean your plant and you'll be ready to go the um what they call it the degreaser will take any uh residue that you left in there okay so i just wanted to i just wanted to point that out because i forgot to like let you guys know or you know show you that little trick but yeah thank you for watching guys [Music] you",

get that on the hob and get it boiling and then yeah I just start water boiling Kate right here and just go ahead first for the water right there just kind of submerge it give it a good old rub something good home wrap and set an alarm for 45 minutes and also guys don't stand over it while you do it for the whole 45 minutes because it made me feel super lightheaded and not in a good way so I don't recommend doing that don't know if it's like fumes or like just the heat I don't know but yeah don't recommend that ya get mixing that every five minutes or so for the 45 minutes it's going to get whiter and whiter with time just like it's Michael Jackson and then it's going to be looking crispy by the end of it as you can see I'm still mixing still whipping and I think this is about ten minutes until the end of the 45 minutes and as you can see it's looking proper white and yeah just keep submerging it making sure the whole thing gets coverage with the dye remover as you can see pretty much out of time so we're going to move on to the next step now I'm just sweet squeezing all that lovely dye remover out before we get on to the next step so just run that water through wring it out make sure it's all out of there and then we're going to move on and get the oxy action vanish stuff on the t-shirt so you're gonna need this vanish powder I'll have this link down below they recommend one scoop obviously Kate's no stranger to a little bit of white powder so I've decided to go for two just for that extra wideness because you know go hard or go home we're whip it up now and just stick the t-shirt in leave this for eight hours which obviously is a long time but that's what they recommend for it to take full effect so you know just do that make sure it's just like submerge the way I've rigged this up you can see eight hours detail and now we come back eight hours layer that is just crystal white very nice now last step just going to want to drain out wring it through again wash it with water and then bring it through you're going to want to hand dry it as well because obviously the crack into the print can be caused by putting it in the other dryer in the lake tumble dryer so don't do that I recommend trying it on the radiator or outside or whatever and then just iron it and it's gonna be looking so crispy so I'll show you the next clip which is gonna be the final product after it's been dried and ironed and it's gonna be insane I think you'll agree it's a lot less yellow and just looks great 100% the best technique for this type of thing [Music]

everybody it's rachel with die press today i want to show you how to use poly t plus for supplementing cotton and cotton blends poly t plus is a one step formula that allows you to prep and sub a shirt in only five minutes paula t plus does two things at once it removes the chemical sizing and it also lays down a polyester resin on the cotton threads let's talk briefly about chemical sizing thread is coated in chemical sizing during the manufacturing process to prevent the thread from breaking while they weave the fabric together sizing can cause two problems one is it will burn and scorch when heated and it will also cause your image to fade after the first second wash poly t plus is sold as a concentrate there are three reasons why we sell it as a concentrate number one we sell it as a concentrate to prevent freezing when we ship it to colder regions we also sell it as a concentrate to extend the shelf life of the product and lastly we sell it as a concentrate to save you money because we don't want you to have to pay for us to ship water across the country since i'm pretty sure you have water where you live here are the four smaller sizes that we sell of poly t plus the four ounce bottle poly t plus will make 16 ounces of spray when you add water and it will coat about 30 shirts the 8 ounce bottle of poly t plus concentrate will make 32 ounces of spray and we'll coat about 60 shirts 16 ounce bottle we'll make a half a gallon or 64 ounces of spray and we'll coat about 120 shirts and lastly the 32 ounce bottle of poly t plus will make a gallon of spray and coat about 240 t-shirts all right so before we spray the shirt we do want to get our heat press heated up because this formula needs to be pressed while wet so i need to make sure my heat press is ready so as soon as i'm done spraying i can press it wet in order to remove the sizing and cure the poly t-plus at the same time so i've set the heat press at 330 degrees and that is currently warming up so while that's warming up we're going to go ahead and spray the shirt the first thing i want to do is i already made up my spray i took the four ounces of concentrate poured it into this 16 ounce bottle and then i added 12 ounces of purified water and shake it up and you're ready to go okay so you want to spray the poly t plus about the size of your image this cardboard is just slightly larger than my image so i'm going to use this as a template to mark to have an idea of where to spray and then you're just going to spray you get it good and wet you need to have it wet in order to see steam and to remove the sizing so this step is actually going to be wetter than the second coat that we will apply after all right i think that's looking pretty good next thing you need to do is cover it with parchment paper any other type of paper will stick so it must be parchment paper uh this is parchment paper from costco the thicker it is the better because if it's really thin and flimsy it will tend to get wrinkles which will press into your shirt so we lay that across there and you should see some steam coming out here okay that's 30 seconds open it up that first coat is dry now we're going to apply a second coat this is the second and final coat this one can be a little bit lighter than the first coat and i'm just i kind of remember where my image is going so i'll just spray that area right and roll it in again all right oh and by the way this shirt is actually a 60 cotton 40 polyester and we recommend starting with a minimum of 40 polyester because you're gonna get more vibrant images uh the shirt that i'm wearing is actually 100 cotton um i did this whole technique on this shirt and it's already been washed but in my opinion it's not as vibrant if there's at least a little bit of polyester in there all right now this time this is the second time we're pressing it wet this time we're only going to press it for 20 seconds and this is to cure and dry the poly t plus so we're ready to subtle mate okay all right now the shirt is ready to sublimate so we're going to set it aside before we sublimate we need to pre-press at 385 for five seconds to make sure there's no more moisture left in the shirt okay i'm ready to subtle mate i got this really cute design from debbie does design and i'm going to put this on the shirt center there and what i like to do is i like to cover my sublimation paper in this case it's just multi-purpose paper cover that with regular copy paper so this absorbs any extra ink that might pass through that way when i do my butcher paper i can keep using this butcher paper over and over again and not have to worry not throw it away and not be so wasteful okay so we have the temperature of 385 we're going to press medium pressure for 70 seconds and actually i just did want to show you here we don't i don't have anything on the press except for the thick rubber mat that came with my heat press and that is because all the seams are off this press if you were doing a smaller shirt like a onesie or kid shirt or even a raglan shirt you would need to lift up the image area higher using a silicone mat so you would lift cut it about the size of your image put it underneath the shirt so that your image area is higher than the thick seams on your shirt like i said medium firm pressure 70 seconds all right 70 seconds is up all right looks good nice and vibrant still feels really soft if you happen to get too much coating on there and it feels a little stiff the softness will come back after the first wash thanks for joining me today be sure to subscribe to our youtube channel also join us on facebook look for the group titled dye sublimation that is sponsored by die press for more details about polyt plus check out www.dipress.com", "M02QVTxhOM0": "- Hey everybody, so my last video I talked about how anyone can get started selling T-shirts online\nfor some extra side money with print-on-demand and\nhow you can even scale it to a full-time income. So in this video, I thought I would take\nyou behind the curtain to show you one of my\nprint-on-demand sites and my eCommerce portfolio that has sold well over a\nmillion dollars in T-shirts. And I'm also gonna take\nyou through 10 things that you need to do before you start selling\nT-shirts to make money online. Now for some of these\nthings, if you skip them, you still might make money\nin your T-shirt business, but you will lose out\non a lot of extra money that you could have had. But for others on the\nlist, it's much worse because if you don't do these things, then you might end up putting your T-shirt business at risk. And just to clarify for\nthose of you that don't know what the phrase print-on-demand is because we have had a lot\nof new subscribers lately. Here is how it works. It's when you print products individually as customers order them. So, for example, there\nare merchandise companies like Printify that will let you upload artwork to their website and then place it on to\nproducts like T-shirts, which you can then list\nand sell in your own store. And then when a customer comes and buys one of the T-shirts from you Printify will then print\nthe design onto the T-shirt and then ship it out to\nthe customer for you. Automatically without you\nhaving to do anything. So yes, print-on-demand is pretty cool. So we've got 10 things to discuss so let's just jump straight into it. One, choose one niche market\nto zoom in on and master. Now there is one exception to this, which I will explain later, but for most people who are looking to start a T-shirt business,\nI very much recommend that you choose a niche market and you focus in on it. So this is one of the stores\nin my eCommerce portfolio and as I said, this one is quite unique because it's done well over\n$1 million worth of T-shirts. So the sales number that was on the screen was the total sales for the store. This is actually a flex store. It sources and sells\nproducts in multiple ways, but the main way it does it\nis through print-on-demand. So what you can do inside\nof Shopify's report section is choose to filter the\nresults by product type. There are much more complex\nfilters that you can use and honestly, as a store\nowner and marketer, this feature is wonderful and\nI'm gonna be using it a lot in this video. But yes, by filtering the results we can see that more than half\nof the sales in this store came from T-shirts. That's a lot of T-shirts. And you know what? All of those T-shirts were\ntargeting one single niche. Yep, all of those T-shirts were\ntargeting one single niche. And, of course, for those\nof you watching out there that don't know the word niche, which can be also said as\nniche, both ways are fine, means to target a distinct\nsegment of a market. In other words, having specific appeal to a targeted group of people. So, for example, if you had\na store targeting pet owners with products for cat owners, dog owners, fish owners, and dragon owners that would be a general store. But if you were to instead just focus in on one specific\npet owner, such as dogs, that would be a niche store. I was reminded the other\nday why I had personally had a whole lot more success with niche stores over general stores when\nI received this comment from a viewer. \"Hi, Sarah, I want to know\nif I'm on the right track. \"I'm aiming to two main subjects,\nHome Depot and clothing. \"For Home Depot, I'll be\nselling things like paintings, \"cups, accessories and things\nfor each section of the house, \"kitchen, bedroom,\nliving room and bathroom. \"For clothes, I'm aiming for women, men, \"babies and especially pets. \"So am I being greedy\naiming for too many things?\" Yes. Let's be honest, mate. The only thing that women, men, babies and pets have in common\nis that they have a pulse and they all living in houses. So I was recently talking\nto my friend, Fred, who literally spends millions\nof dollars every year advertising his niche stores, and I was talking to him about\nhow I get lots of questions from people in the comments\nwanting to set up general stores and he said to me, \"By why\ndo they wanna do that?\" and I said to him, \"It's\nbecause of the fact \"that they think that if they\ntarget one specific niche \"that they're not gonna be\nable to scale their store \"since they will run out\nof products to sell in it.\" And he looked at me\nbefuddled and he's like, \"But it's the opposite. \"Niche stores are easier to\nscale than general stores.\" and I agreed. The reason why we genuinely believe this is because when you have a niche store you're building up a\ncustomer base of people that you know are passionate\nabout one specific thing and what that means then is it much easier to launch new products again and again, and have your previous customers come back to buy your newly launched products, and this is especially true\nwith print-on-demand stores like T-shirts business where you can essentially\ncreate unlimited products. You are only limited by your imagination or by your designer's imagination. Whereas with a general\nstore, your customer list is very fragmented. It's pretty much summed\nup by that famous phrase. Jack of all trades, master of none. That's why as you can see, this\nis not a one product store. This is a long-term store and it has sold many different designs with lots of repeat customers. I get a lot of people ask\nme about one product stores and I'm sorry people,\nbut those just aren't the sort of stores that I\npersonally invest in to. So don't expect them for this channel. But like with all things in life I've got friends who\nreally like general stores and they can probably\nargue their case very well. So remember, in life\nthere is no best business. There are just different businesses. However, I genuinely believe\nthat niche stores are easier especially for beginners to market, but as I said there is\none exception to this. Two, consider opening a general store on third party eCommerce platform. Yes, this is the exception to that. T-shirt business is on a\nthird party eCommerce website like Redbubble or Merch by Amazon you should very much consider that. Why, well, it's because\nRedbubble and Merch By Amazon are general stores. So you're essentially listing\nyour T-shirts for sale on what is already an\nextremely large general store and you don't have control over marketing to previous customers. It's Redbubble and Amazon that do that. So you don't get the same\nbenefit from niching down and branding your store. Because think about it, here's a T-shirt that a\nseller is selling on Amazon using the print-on-demand\nprogram, Merch By Amazon, and if we use the Amazon sales\nresearch tool, Jungle Scout, we can see in the past month it estimates that they have\nmade thousands of dollars, which is pretty cool. However, when a customer\ncomes and buys this T-shirt they will have other products\nup-sold to them on Amazon, and you know what, these products here they are not the seller's products. They are the products\nfrom their competitors. What this all means then is that on a third party\neCommerce site like Amazon you don't get the same advantage that you get in your own store where you can create a curated\nexperience for your customer where you can control the customer journey and up-sell them to multiple\nproducts by niching down. Three, add simple text-based\nT-shirts as cross-sells and up-sells, and to pad out your store. One of the challenging things about starting a T-shirt\nbusiness is the design part. Even if you yourself are a designer, it still takes a lot of\ntime and creative energy to come up new great designs. So that is why, if you ask for\nany URLs to my stores I own, nope, I'm not gonna give them to you. So that you can come in and steal my IPs. But anyway, moving on. Something I've highlighted\nbefore on this channel is that simple text-based\ndesigns can sell extremely well for humorous T-shirts,\nbut that doesn't mean that they only exclusively\nsell for humorous designs. Nope, so if we come back to my report on the top selling T-shirts in my store. You'll see that sitting\nat number 10 is this one that sold 835 shirts, and trust me, this design, it is painfully simple. Like painfully simple. Now, since I don't want\nto reveal my design IPs for people to steal, I have instead opted to create a similar example product in my example Shopify store Brewed Treets, and here it is. Yep, it literally is\njust a big block of text of a popular one word phrase in my niche on a basic T-shirt. And it's these sorts of\nT-shirts that anyone, regardless of designing\nabilities, can create Just by using simple, free apps like Canva and Pixlr's inbuilt\nopen source free fonts, anyone can create these\nsimple text-based designs, like this one, that made over $22,000. And you know what, that's just\n$22,000 from T-shirts alone. Coming back to the product sale report, I switched up the filters to show all of the\ndifferent types of products that also feature this\ndesign in the store, not just T-shirts, and\ncollectively this simple design has sold over $82,000\nacross all of its products that it's been printed on to. But while that's great and all, I have to stress, this is not a design that I would recommend\nsending paid traffic to. Paid traffic is expensive and so to turn a profit, especially if you're using\nFacebook or Instagram, you really need to have\nan eye-popping design that's gonna catch the attention of the person who's\nscrolling through their feed and you know what, designs like this, they're just not very visually engaging. Obviously as you can see though, preexisting shoppers who are\nin the mood to buy more things will add these simple text-based\ndesigns to their carts too, but they are best left for shoppers who have already found your\nwebsite through other products or free organic traffic, not paid traffic. Teaching how to create these simple text-based designs\nusing Canva is something that I teach in my\npremium training course, The Ecomm Clubhouse. If you're interested in\ncurated tutorial videos I'll have a link to it in\nthe video description below. Four, check what T-shirts you\nare selling to your customers. Here is something to be aware of. When it comes to T-shirts,\nnot all T-shirts are the same. So, for example, if we\nhead on over to Printify, you'll see that there are\nmultiple types of unisex T-shirts. There's this one here,\nwhich is $20.81 a shirt and then there's this one\nhere, which is $8.30 a shirt and then you have this\none, which is even cheaper, $7.10 a shirt. So you might be thinking,\nwhy is one T-shirt $21 and another T-shirt is\na third of the price? Well, it's because of this. Not all T-shirts are the same. So this cheap T-shirt here,\nthe actual make of the T-shirt is listed here. It's a Gildan 5000 whereas this more expensive\n$8.10 T-shirt here, this is Bella + Canvas 3001. These are two completely\ndifferent makes of T-shirts and thus, they have two\nvery different prices. This information is usually available for a free third party eCommerce platforms with print-on-demand\ncapabilities like Teespring, you just gotta look for it. For example, if you come\non over here to Teespring, you'll see that there\nare different T-shirts and you might think well,\nwhat's the difference between the $10.50 Tee and the $14.33 Tee So to find out, you just gotta come to Teespring's product overview page. And here you'll get more detail on what brands that they use. So their premium tees use Next Level whereas their cheaper\ntees use either Hanes or Gildan, depending on\nwhere it's fulfilled from. So how can you choose\nwhich one's right for you? Well, actually it's pretty easy. Five, use Jiffy T-shirts\nto research reviews for different styles of T-shirts. So pretty much all\nprint-on-demand companies will list the different T-shirts that they use on their site. But there is one\nparticular company Printful which has an additional\nfeature, and it's this. Reviews. The print-on-demand store\nowners can leave reviews for different products. They usually aren't\nreviewing the print quality, more the T-shirt brand itself. So this T-shirt here, the Anvil 88VL has a 3.5\nstar rating out of five. Now on the surface that's not great is it? You probably think well, you\nknow, I'll avoid this T-shirt. But here is the thing. Four reviews? Statistically, that is pathetic. All it takes is for some\nsilly reviews to be left. This person here left a three star review with no complaints. They simply rated it three stars because they didn't know if\nthey liked the shirt or not yet. So to them, this was a neutral review. And this person here\ndidn't like the fabric and thinks it's bad. Yet, this person below\nthem really likes it. With such a small number of reviews you can't really know who\nwas right and who was wrong. So what you need to do is you\nneed to come to Jiffy Shirts, a T-shirt wholesale website and do a search for reviews\non that particular style and brand of T-shirt. And that will give you an\nactual true representation of the quality of it, and\nwhether people like it or not. When you do that you find\nthat actually this T-shirt is extremely well reviewed when you increase the\ncustomer sample size. Now when you're starting out and you don't have a strong brand yet, it's fine to use T-shirts like this to keep your starting costs low, but if you have an established\nstore like my one is, then like me you'll want to\nswitch to higher quality Tees with softer cotton. Two good brands that\nbalance cost with quality that are available on a lot\nof print-on-demand websites are Bella + Canvas and Anvil. Six, stop refunds by not\nselling T-shirt that run small. Okay, so if we come back\nto my report in Shopify, check it out, there have been\nover $1.5 million in sales with Tees in the store, after\nyou account for the discounts. And the refunds? Just $24,000, and when you calculate it, that is less than 2% refunds, which is way below industry\naverage for a store this size and do you know how you\nget a refund rate that low? By ensuring that you have happy customers. So when you come to a\nprint-on-demand website and you are choosing your\nTees, I strongly recommend, for the sake of simplicity\nto avoid T-shirts that feature this dreaded\ntext in their description. So, for example, let's compare\nthese two sizing charts. Here is one T-shirt. As the description says,\nit runs true to size. So if you scroll down to the sizing chart, we'll see the different\nsizes go up to three XL. Now, let's compare that\nto this T-shirt here, which runs small. If you scroll down to the bottom and check out that T-shirt's sizing chart, we'll see that the sizing\nis extremely different and that someone who fit a\nlarge T-shirt in the first one will not fit a large in the cut of T-shirt because it, well, is\ndrastically different. Here they are side-by-side\nand as you can see, the T-shirt that runs small does not scale as sizing goes up. And so when someone who\nnormally wears a large T-shirt, gets it, and it doesn't fit,\nthey go, huh, that's weird. Guess there's something\nwrong with my T-shirt and I need to get a refund. And even if they didn't assume that, if you normally wear a large T-shirt and the large T-shirt doesn't fit you, you know what? That's not a nice feeling. And not only will it mean then\nthat customers will feel bad because of the fact that\ntheir T-shirts don't fit them, but they'll also be less likely to order from you in the future because think about it, no-one who normally wears a large T-shirt wants to have to order a two XL. Having happy customers\nis extremely important when running an online store and it's something that I\ndiscuss in my free ebook. \"The Six Tips That Six\nFigure Online Stores Follow To Make Over $10,000 A\nMonth,\" and you'll find links to download that ebook in\nthe video description below. Seven, be aware that not all\nprint-on-demand providers do large prints. This is just a quickie, but keep in mind before you design your T-shirt, not all print-on-demand\nproviders do large designs. For example on Printify you don't order your\nT-shirts directly from them, they just act as a third party service that connects you to the\nprint-on-demand providers, and one of their suppliers that\nwill print onto this T-shirt is DTG2Go, and they have the capacity to print this design onto\nthis Bella + Canvas 3001 Tee. Whereas this other\nprovider, Monster Digital, can only print the\ndesign onto that same Tee at a smaller size. Now oftentimes this doesn't really matter, but there are some of you out there that might be designing your\nT-shirts to be a full print that goes over the whole T-shirt. So keep this in mind before\nyou start designing it. There is a slight work around for this when you're doing your marketing. Eight, pick product mock-ups\nto increase conversions. So here is a sneaky trick\nthat we use in the industry. So when you're using a\nprint-on-demand provider most of them will give you a\nvisual mock-up of the product that you are selling to be\nable to use to market it, but unfortunately these\nusually aren't all that great. So as my subscribers\nknow I usually recommend that you create your own product mock-ups to use in your own marketing. And the place that I often recommend is this website here Placeit. With Placeit, you can upload your design that you plan to print onto a T-shirt, Placeit will then create\nbeautiful mock-up pictures for you featuring your design\nthat you can then use to advertise and promote it. They are infinitely better than standard boring mock-up photos that print-on-demand providers give you. However, when you're choosing which mock-ups to use in your store keep in mind, if you are selling a T-shirt that features a small print or can only print onto a\nsmall area of the T-shirt when it comes to just the\nplain product mock-up photo it can look a little awkward. On a mock-up like this, the\ndesign looks really small in relation to the T-shirt itself, which it can make it\nless visually appealing and not pop as well. But there is a solution. And that is to use crumbled mock-ups or mock-ups where the T-shirt\nis tied in a knot like this. This helps to draw attention\naway from the empty fabric and instead draw attention\nto the design itself, increasing conversions by creating a more eye-popping picture. Nine, choose a T-shirt printing company that offers the services that you need. So here is another quick tip. Do you remember how there\nwere these two companies that Printify work with,\nDTG2Go and Monster Digital, that will both print onto the same shirt, but have different printing size areas? Well, that's not all that's\ndifferent about them. Monster Digital here, the only service that they have on offer is\nthey'll print whatever you want on the front and back of\nthe shirt and that's it. Whereas DTG2Go offers\nseveral other services. Not only will they print\non the front and back, but they'll always print on the sleeves and they will print a custom\nlabel for additional branding. Printing on the sleeves\nis free, I believe, but a custom label is\nnot, so keep that in mind. Now for most of you, the standard label that's\nalready on the shirt is absolutely fine, but\nif you were planning to have your own really\nhigh quality T-shirt brand, then you want to make sure\nthat that feature is included with the supplier that you choose. The same goes for Printful, they do all of their printing in-house, but not all T-shirts are\neligible for additional features like custom tags. So to check just filter the results and now you'll know which\nT-shirts to choose from. 10, check to see if your\nniche is about to die. Or if it is secretly a seasonal niche, so that you don't get catch\nout by any unexpected, unhappy surprises, when\nyour sales suddenly dip. So let me show you how to check this. So Google has a great\nfree tool, Google Trends. If we type in a phrase, such as SpongeBob, we'll see how much search\ninterest the phrase SpongeBob has received over time in Google. So if we set the results to show us how SpongeBob the show has trended over the past five years we'll see some interesting things, and as you can see, interest\nup until 2018 had kind of flattened out, but in 2019\nSpongeBob had a resurgence. So this tool is a great way to\nsee if interest in your niche that you plan to make and sell T-shirts in is about to rise or if it's about to fall. Case in point, there is an\nonline game called Happy Wheels, which has a huge online\ncommunity dedicated to it, but take a look at it on Google Trends. As you can see, the\noverall trend for the game, well, it's not good. So I highly recommend\nthat you come on here and you check out how your niche is doing. And something that I\nwant you to keep in mind is this as well. Even if your niche isn't\ndoing so hot right now, as SpongeBob showed us,\nniches they don't just fall, but they rise as well. So while it's probably a\ngood idea to think twice before you get into a niche\nwhich is in the middle of a rapid decline, if your\nniche interest is bottomed out then this could be a\nreally great time to get in to capitalize when your\nniche trends up again, which is exactly what\nhappened with Minecraft. Minecraft videos or\nrelated merch plummeted, but the creators who stuck\naround when it bottomed out got paid handsomely when it rose again. And by the way, while you\ndo have to be very careful if you want to piggyback off\nof popular IPs like SpongeBob when you're creating your own merch there are some ways to legally do it. Which I discuss in this video. There is another reason that\nyou should use this tool to double check your niche and that is because it\nmight actually secretly be a seasonal niche. So a niche that is seasonal that would probably\nsurprise no-one is baseball. If we take a look at baseball\nover the past five years we'll see that interest in it rises sharply when summer hits. But you know what? I've discovered something surprising. I've see plenty of successful\nprint-on-demand stores that focus on brands of trendy\ncars with big fan bases. And so I wondered how is the\nMini Cooper doing these days. When I did a search for\nit and I took a look back at the past five years,\nI was shocked to discover that this is, well, a seasonal niche. Interest in Mini Coopers\nrise as the summer hits and then it falls down over winter. Now perhaps because I'm\nnot a big car person, this is more surprising to me, so I decided to compare\nit to the Toyota Corolla and while interest definitely\ndips over winter for it, as a whole, it's not as\npronounced or as seasonal as the Mini Cooper. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with seasonal niches. It's absolutely normal. It's just nice to know\nabout this in advance so that when you see sales dip in the fall you don't freak out because you know that they're gonna rise\nagain in the summer.

show you how you can grow your business by choosing to be different and we inspired a movement here we are six years later in the middle of an industry-wide tipping point where more people than ever before are seeing the value in going with Bella canvas the fastest-growing brand in the industry so check out these videos from 2012 they are still as relevant as ever hi I'm a Bella canvas tea cart it open and I haven't been outside in a long time and just how long has it been the year was 1999 and I was a one-time promotional giveaway but then somebody took me home and crammed me right bottom of your heart how long you been out friend here I'm super south 1% combed and ring spun teaser a war homes at times my retail TV appearance is some of the people proud to put the logos off what year is this ostracizing show because of like you can not because of watching hi my Bella canvas team and I have a card it opened NT what is all that what you tweaked so over you man oh yeah yeah this is how I made it takes a little more time and effort to remove debris so how do you stay so soft come on a person comb the ring-spun cotton so I thought well the impurities come down at me through multiple cleansing processes maybe nothing but pure cotton fabric would you want it that's it awesome yeah it can be I give me cone you're never gonna be comfortable that a moment hi I'm the Bella campus dude and I'm a car dude open NT are you smiling about over there I'm gonna chipped out today what really yeah I can end up on tour with a rock band or join a fraternity or even end up in a retail boutique possibilities are endless you get so many awesome options dude how are you getting into a retail store customers only one 100% comb and ring-spun cotton shirts that you know our sides seemed in fashion forward no retail stores gonna want to offer their customers inferior product like carted open and wait what are you going I don't know probably a one-time promotional giveaway and then straight to the back of a closet for the rest of my life oh you got stuff going for you yeah name one Gucci yeah be cool be cool it's retail hello did you know that I am super cheap I'll see the world buddy I guess this is goodbye hey guys guys I'm still in here hello hi I'm a Bella canvas T and I'm a cartoon open-ended hey bounce how you doing what up you're a hundred percent come to ring spun cotton tea you're always welcome every Delta thanks buddy right no I'm not you wait why here at retail we have standards I'm just no you're not you're carted open in and we hadn't let you in a retail in five years can you please just don't be touchy [Music] we're at capacity hey guys hey guys I'm right here yeah we're gonna need security we've got a cou like fun yeah he's a scratchy water we can hear everything you", "Qf5soaOZcj0": "[Music] hi everybody sprite here from kandy systems very excited about today because today i have one of my favorite people in the entire world with me um and that is christopher sigmund from forever hello christopher hello sprite good morning how is everybody ah i hope everybody's good and i hope we don't have any audio issues um you guys let me know if we do uh david's not in the office today so i'm have to having to troubleshoot everything myself we'll see how it goes but i'm really really excited about what you're going to do today because yesterday doug did his he did a bunch of hot stamp foils with the laser dark which was it turned out really really good or the laser light no cut but everybody kept asking well how do we do this with sublimation and so i'm very excited to do sublimation of cotton today great so we're definitely going to do some hot stomach for today and let's see how quick how creative we can get today sounds good all right well with all that being said i'm going to turn it over to you and and and have fun thanks guys so today we were going to show you sappy light no cut we're going to show you satellite no cut glitter subtly light with hot stamping foil exactly dart glitter and supple flex 202 so five products and we also play a little bit around with it so we can combine for example exactly light glitter the foot stepping foil and if you have any questions just type into your chat sprite will show them out to me and i'll just answer them right on the go so we need a sublimation printer we do need a heat press like over here and a computer of course to print out of subtly light cotton for those who don't know is a relatively new product about a year old and it allows you to use your sublimation printer to decorate cotton garments subtly light and supple light glitter will work on light colored garments that's why we call it light and suddenly dark glitter will work on dark colored garments like this one over here let me just show you the bird's eye view so you can see a little bit of what i have prepared for you uh this this over here this is sadly light this here is sapli dark glitter over here we have sapli light glitter the christmas shirt this is supply flex 202 and on hot stamping foil just to give you an example let's just spread this out for you this is hot stamping foil with subtly light and this subtly finishing foil let's just start with the easiest one the easiest one would be subtly light no cut there we go so this looks like a regular piece of paper i hope the camera can catch it so this here has a printable side has kind of a rubbery texture to it and on the back side let me just see if the camera can pick it up we have this way a satellite no cut print out on it we're going to feed this to our mesh printer over here i do have the sawgrass sg800 sublimation printer print 11x17 it would also work on the newer models like soccer's 1000 or so of course 500. it works also with most epson laser sublimation printers let me just set this up we're gonna feed it with the printed side facing upwards put the cartridge in and we're gonna print it out so when we print it out we print over the virtual also print manager or the saw correspond manager when you work with the new version of it and on the soft press print manager you just select cotton and under cotton you will find subtly light something like twitter and sub reflex profiles for it if when you print on something dark litter you can basically just use the same profiles as for supply light clicker so we're gonna print this over here just make sure you do mirror it push the print button just takes a short moment and then it will print out while it's printing i hope the printer is not too loud we just take our t-shirt which is there we are a 100 cotton garment let me just see if i can get the camera to focus ah camera doesn't want to focus right now there we go 100 cotton fruit loot garment nope there's no spray on it the shirt comes as it is straight from the box we're going to place it on our heat press what you want to do is you want to preheat it to get moisture out of it we work here with about 180 degrees celsius or about 360 degrees fahrenheit and we just preheat it for like 15 to 20 to 30 seconds we just observe our heat press there's always a little bit of steam coming out it's the moisture that's trapped in the shirt and when this is dry we just open up the a press just reduce the pressure a little bit so now we have a nice flat surface it's dry and then we're going to take our print out that's mirrored and do place it on our garment let me just show you in a close-up how the print looks like there's some banding in there but it shouldn't be too big of an issue you can see that the ink is really glossy and it's wet see that how weird it is you want to use it as long as this is wet we're going to place it here you don't move it otherwise it works much then we press for 30 seconds at 360 degrees fahrenheit and we peel it hot as soon as the press is ready what's happening right now is that not we do not actually sublimate like the ink is not becoming a gas in this state and will migrate into the fibrous but there is a special coating on the paper and this coating will transfer together with the inks on the cotton garment hey christopher so jerry has a question she says she asks um if the design has a lot of detail should you cut around it you don't have to cut around it if you have a lot of detail let me just finish this one here ah just give you the birth eye view if you had designed a lot of detail let's say just get it over here so you can see how much detail it has let's just zoom into the fine text over here you can see that let me just move this up so there we go and you can see how big my finger is and you can see how fine the text over here is you do not have to cut it up the only thing that you might see on a little bit darker shirts that doesn't get darker than a white or like gray shirt is on the closed letters like here on the g or on the o in the no cut you might find a little bit of coating transferring with the design but typically on a light colored garment you will not see it so it doesn't matter how detailed your design is let me just show you a quite good example that i did recently is the godzilla design over here which is the total so this is how it looks like and here on the collapsed building we have a little bit of wires hanging around little steel bars over there and just zoom in for you even that little detail over here i mean you can recognize the structure of the fabric from from here that transfers so there's no need to cut around what is important to mention is that supply light subtly light glitter and supply dark glitter will only work with certain artwork it will not work with photographic artwork and it needs strong bold colors so every time you have an artwork with light colors like pastel shades sky blues or for example lighter skin tones like mine you would need a higher ink density the way the paper works is with ink and with the weight of the ink so to speak and as soon as you put enough ink so enough liquid basically onto the paper you can activate the coating and you print more ink on darker colors that's why it works only with full tone vector artwork not the photographic artwork so i have a i have a few more questions um so uh elizabeth asks do you need to place paper inside the shirt so that the design won't go through to the other side good question let me show you okay this is the shell we just did just get the close-up can and let's go over here to the inside so of course you can see let's just see if the camera can catch that yeah you can see the design on the inside on the front side which is quite normal that's something that you have a screenprint as well but let me just put it inside out for you so this here is the inside of the garment and you don't see anything so it will not sublimate through because we are not actually sublimating onto it we're basically transferring the sublimation on top if that makes sense yes so and there's been a qui a few questions about the washability of it yes i mean you guys made some tests with it uh i would say last about 25 to yes 25 watches is a good number it will fade over time because it's not real sublimation as we know it we're not dyeing the fabric but we're putting a transfer on top of it for this more for like promotional or fashion artwork and nothing for that will last you several years what's important is that you have to finish your print with a parchment paper like a matte finish or if you like it more glossy with the glossy finish this will help to embed the transfer stronger into the fabric and it will last much longer we do this for about 15 seconds um so us finn said he tried this out and he had a couple of breakouts in the picture um so what was he doing wrong if you have breakouts in the picture then we will have it mostly with lighter colors in the artwork so in this case the artwork was not suitable or was not set up correctly for the for the paper so a good way to recognize it is if you print a color chart like on forever ots.com on the download section you will find a color chart with little squares and it will give you cmyk color numbers for example a red consists out of 100 magenta and thunderbirds and yellow and if you add those up together you have 200 color saturation or 20 of weight of ink weight and you will need about 100 150 depending a little bit on the printer on ink weight or color to make the paper work did you answer your question uh i think so i think i think so um yeah i've also noticed um that sometimes uh if the pressure isn't right um that it can i can also have i've noticed a few people trying to use clamshell presses and they have um issues where they're not getting good pressure on one side or the other yes this can happen we do highly recommend swing away heat pressures like the g9 dk20s over here it is the insta 256 like the upper class heat clamp clamshell swing away heat presses and this is something we highly recommend a good way to figure out if you have enough pressure would be either the ten dollar note test or the parchment paper test so the way this works let me just give you the birth a few we have our parchment paper we put it in for about one third we close it and just change the camera again if i can pull it out with just two fingers here i can't i don't have enough pressure and typically on a clamshell heat press it will close in the back over here first so you have more pressure in the back and less pressure in the front or on another example when we have a thicker garment like this one over here like here on a sweatshirt we do want to leave the collar off the press like this so we have not even pressure all over so especially when we work with hoodies or sweatshirts like this one make sure that the collar is not inside the pressing area just leave it a little bit out then you have more even pressure so now we have seen how the subtly light works what would happen if we print a design like this onto a dark garment well pretty much the same as it would happen with regular sublimation there is no white ink in the sublimation printer and sublimation it does not have any opacity so we will have the garment influence the final print color so let me see what i have down here we do have a girly pink a manly light blue a heather gray or a stronger pink what would you like to see um let's go let's go let's go blue let's do blue and let's do blue so and i i have i have a couple of questions um i think uh some people are confused about the type of artwork so um when you say vector based uh you're just meaning um not photography so it has to be right so it has to be rich colors and not photography because jerry asked about using it in cmyk and that's not neces that's not true at all it's an rgb color scheme um you just uh uh you have to make sure they're very vibrant colors yes so basically when you use a thing by k you can very easily figure out if you have a rich color or not if we seem okay the lower the lower the number is the less color you print with rgb it's a complete opposite you have numbers from 0 to 255 and that on three colors r g and b like red green and blue and the more higher the number is the lighter the color becomes it's quite hard to figure out if you have enough ink or not with c y k we have four numbers like cyan magenta yellow and k for black and they go from one to from zero to one hundred and if all these numbers add up to at least one hundred or one hundred fifty and certain apps and printers then you have enough ink to work with it and it's quite easy to do actually to go into photoshop or corel most of the time you have like the eye picker to eye drop a tool or like an info box you can just hover your mouse over it and will tell you exactly how much color you have with on certain areas of your artwork so what you would like to have is strong bold colors like this example over here i'll just get you another few like this example over here where we have a strong red we have orange and earthy tones over here yellow tones and black so there's no lighter color in there can you talk about the uh the hand of the subalight how it feels yes absolutely so basically you will feel something on it but it's less than vinyl it's always like a screen print i would say it's not heavy at all i can stretch it and it comes back nicely just go back and stretch it comes back nicely you don't have this paper feeling in this paper noise so basically the garment will just the garment by itself and make it like this front cam so you can see me this here is my microphone over there and if i go with the garment itself this is the garment noise that you have and on the on the artwork itself you go over here you basically have no additional noise on it so there's not much on it it's very soft almost like a rubbery screen printed type of feel so let's just do the same article we just did but on the blue shirt so you can see how the color will be influenced this time i printed a little bit bigger what we're using over here is by the way just regular subject hd inks so there's no chrome blasting or no specific ink let me just wait until the printer is finished so you can hear me a little bit better but very important here is just regular sublimation so the same ink that you use for your everyday sublimation jobs no special printer no special ink the only thing you have to change is the paper and disregards so anthony asked a good question does this work with 50 50 sweatshirts or does it have to be a hundred percent cotton um it does work with fifty fifties or even with hundred percent polyester in case you want to do it this way uh it makes actually sense to make it to work with polyester when you work with the glitter substrates let me just show you one over here so this here is a sweatshirt and i don't know if you can recognize this in this camera but when i show it over here and close up you can see that this here has glitter particles just zoom in for you so it has a nice subtle glitter it's much much softer than a regular heat one so glitter vinyl just like this stretch it and let me just see what kind of garment is this this here just go back and turn much sharp so this here i hope you can read it is 80 cotton and 20 polyester so mixed fabrics mixed fabrics will work as well so like 50 50s or like 65 35 and we have quite often with sweatshirts there's absolutely no problem at all typically you can print on any kind type of garment with this heat resistant to the temperature that we're using on the heat press which is about 360 degrees fahrenheit so my garment here is preheated my printout over here is ready so you can see it's glossy so there's a lot of ink on it and you want to use it while it's still moist you can let it sit here for like five to ten minutes but please don't let it sit for longer because if the longer the printout will sit there more moisture will evaporate from the front out so it will dry up and if it's too dry there's basically just sitting too left ink on the paper and it will not activate the coating that will bond with the garment anymore so then we'll have a fully transfer so very important to oop preheat your garment use solid artwork like solid colored artwork and do not let the printout dry completely so let's just peel this off just give you the other can bird's eye it's a hot peel there's actually not much special to it when you peel it just make it make sure that you peel it while it's hot so this works great and well i think we're back up on youtube but it never fails all right let's uh okay we are back on youtube but um but not on facebook well we we are we're just on a different uh we're on a different stream i love i love i love the internet it's this is my my favorite um so you're good to go okay good so on this uh uh sweatshirt over here we can see that we have glitter particles on the actual transfer itself and the way to achieve this twitter look is by i hope you can see this in the comments i love the internet yes this is what's up um sorry sorry okay does it pick it up it looks probably looks quite white on the back on the on the camera and it has the named supply light up printed on the back side of it and the way this media works is exactly the same as which is something like regular so we put it in our printer the printed already virtually also print manager or the socrates print manager we do select the right paper and we push the print button pretty much the same process what we also want to do is we want to preheat our garment again so this time let me just use the light pink one this one over here again the moisture will evaporate and as soon as no steam coming up anymore the garment is preheated and ready to be decorated so this was about 15 seconds now and here we have our printout now we can see the glitter part is a little bit better with the ink on it and replace the transfer while it's still wet onto our garment and the glitter is especially great for everybody at last a little bit of extra bling bling i probably can see my girlfriend working with running around with one of these shirts over here for christmas and the nice thing with the glitter is we can actually combine it with hot stamping foil but we come to that in a second so same process we do want a hot peel and there we go so just move the camera a little bit and now we have here a self-reading twitter artwork let me just zoom in for you and throughout and what you can see is that it only transfers glitter particles where the actual artwork is like here in the empty space where nothing has printed we just have to pure garment color on the text down here even here in the little eyes over here let's just see if we can zoom in a little further see that it even prints these little ears over here in the little antennas so this is a great add-on if you like click supplementing glitter vinyl the supplied twitter will be a great add-on sprite how much do you like hot stamping foil how much do i like it i absolutely love it it is one of my new favorite things and to work with hot stamping foil we have a so-called subtly finishing foil adhesive this is basically a clear film and it's slightly milky one side has an adhesive on it the other side is just blank and if you can scratch the part let me just go over here on this camera if you can scratch the part off like over here then this is the right side facing towards the garment so we take this now place it on top of our existing printout you can do this with a regular supple light and we can also do this with this supply light clicker just cover this up with some parchment paper or coffee paper whatever we have attend same temperature let's get the camera out of the way and press it for about just 10 seconds so feel it while it's hot a little bit of ink will come off we'll just see a bit better over here but it's nothing to worry about that's quite normal it's just supplemented a little bit into the adhesive and now we can see this it's slightly tacky we can use that tackiness to attract hot stamping for us i brought a small selection with me do you have any favorite sprite like we have here i i like the rainbow one you like the rainbow one yeah then we're gonna make rainbow so what i'm gonna use is i just press on a part of it with hot stamping foil so just cut this off over here and place it onto just this way on the speech bubble we don't need that much and a little bit here on that corner so there we go then we're gonna just cover it with parchment paper or if you've got the finishing sheet whatever we prefer to have same temperature and we press it for about 10 to 20 seconds and during that period the adhesive that we just applied to the actual printout will get reactivated and we basically grab onto the hot stamping foil and we make it last very long in the wash this is 20 seconds yes i can definitely speak for the washability of the hot stamping foil because some of my favorite shirts have hot stamping foil and i think um i've washed them probably 50 to 60 times so how often do you wear a shirt sprite i typically wear shirts because i have so many of them and so many different ones basically like every third week i wear the same shirt every third week you wear this well i don't have as many clothes as you apparently yeah because i like to experiment i like to play around with it and uh forever let's play with it and they like it when i'm creative so i'm using that and whether you just buy shirts for me flank shirts and just whenever i find a free time a little bit free extra time i just design a little graphic like godzilla ones something that i played around with recently okay let me just see which color is best let's just use this angle over here and every time i find a little bit of time to design something i just play around with it and create a new t-shirt for me so that's why i have so many and it will they will last me forever actually so as soon as the foil is cold like cold to the touch which doesn't take so much so long you can just peel it off and the hot stamping foil would actually just stick wherever the out this of course there you go save the drama for the llama in rainbow how do you like it i absolutely love it that looks great so we have now combined glitter from here together with hot stamping foil and we wash exactly the same of course we covered up the glitter now without stamping foil but this is a way to really get creative and combine glitter without stamping for it which is great for like birthday shirts and so on especially when you have little girls and the nice thing about this we can reuse this foil if we want to let's say if i want to press print something on here i could absolutely do so but if we want to make the foil last longer we can just cover it up with some parchment or some glossy finishing sheet we just repress it again for a couple of seconds just to make sure the foil really and bats to the print out and then it will last a moment how many times 50 60 washers yeah pretty much forever yeah um one of the things that we do is we when we make shirts and when we first got all the material we um we give them to the guys in the warehouse my husband being one of them and yes he's definitely washed shirts um to where the shirt breaks down before the print does so so uh we now have seen subtly light softly light glitter and we all have seen the hot stamping foil the nice thing about hot stamping foil is we can actually use it also on dark colored garments so if you want to we basically create a printout we typically use black because black is a dense color but we don't necessarily have to work with black you can also work with purple or with red or green we will stick all the same disc in the case of sappy light stuff like glitter now we're going to work with something dark glitter which again looks quite similar to the subtly light clitter put one sheet next to each other let me just see if you can get a good view of it over here okay you don't see it let me just try this camera i don't know if you can see it from the camera i don't see it on my screen but the subtly light glitter has more like a glittery look to it while the subject dark letter has just a couple of dots like glitter dots on the paper and they are covered with a white layer on the back side it's quite easy to different differentiate just go back this subway dark attack comes with a blue backside print and has written subtly dark on it let me just pull this over so it says supply dark litter and it's blue and this up the light glitter basically has this the product name on the back side of it so it's quite hard quite hard to mix both up and the way this works is again pretty much the same as with a supple exactly like glitter print out you print it put in the printer facing downwards and you just get a design for you use that one i like that one so the virtual auto print manager is just receiving the file it's mirrored so it's good to go you just push the print button suddenly dark glitter will give you even opec colors like these over here onto a dark garment and we'll add a little layer to it let me just get you a close-up see that it's a nice clear layer to it there's no cutting no weeding involved so we can do fine details as well there we go and also here apply the same rules do you want to preheat our garment we take our printout like over here and typically after 30 25 to 30 seconds it should be ready to go we take our printout this is the printed side and facing the printed side towards the shirt and on the subway dark litter we want to increase pressure a little bit again we're pressing for 30 seconds and then we peel hot it's a little bit harder to put to peel ah there we go create vintage design there we go um just get over here and then you want to finish it in this case with the glossy finishing sheet can you see how glossy and shiny it is i think doug used it yesterday and we repress it for about 15 to 20 seconds when you work with a softly uh dark glitter you need to make sure it has really really strong dark colors so it is ah that's a good camera angle so we can actually quite see how shiny it is just get the other camera for you guys close up we zoom in you can see it's nice and shiny the question comes up quite often on the subway dark is if there is also something dark without glitter and there is not at least not yet the reason being is the glitter particles in the subway dark litter work as an additional opacity layer and they light up the colors so it can really stand up onto darker garments if you would use for example regular so there's a regular stuff with dark formulation without the particles there would not be enough um opacity to actually withstand a dark fabric you don't get true enough colors that make sense so that's why we haven't launched a subway dark product right as of yet some space over here this one over here is supple flex reflex 202 and as we can see over here we have a lot of lighter colors in here like sometimes you have even have white and if you have photographic artwork and want to print or even if you have any artwork you want to print onto dark fabrics with cotton then you would have to use the supple flex 202 which is basically a heat transfer vinyl that you have to cut and weed out so you can use a cricut or a silhouette or something similar and cut out the shape that is the shape of the art of your artwork peel it off like over here so like this here is already printed and cut i'm going to peel it off the ground just give me the words a few and you peel it off like so actually quite easy to weed i personally prefer the no wheat products because i'm just lazy so this is read it out except a little over here but we'll get to that in a minute and with the subtle flex 202 we can actually work with photographic artwork let me just give you the close-up camera over here so you can see how the artwork looks like so we have basically a city line of new york over here but actually photographic artwork and the only way to work with photographic artwork with subject to cotton is right now the subreflex 202 pull this one out what i really like about the suppliflex 202 is the color will get activated while pressing it's almost like a little magic trick it comes with its own carrier tape so you don't have to buy additional carrier tape which is worth a few and we press it for about 15 to 30 seconds the first time and if you prefer a more matte look we prefer more matte look then we do press it again for another 15 seconds of the match finished paper zap reflex 2 2 always has kind of a semi-gloss look to it so you'll never get it completely matted down just pick this up what's the great way to work with actual photographic artwork so we can see that the is coming through already just let it cool off for a moment just two moments while this is cooling off because this is a little bit denser material with a little bit more time we could either use german technology like just putting something heavy on it it cools down much quicker or we can print another t-shirt let's just do sub delight with hot stamping foil and see how crazy we can get and let's just use go over here and use an all black design how many colors has doug used yesterday three was it right uh yes i think he did use three so again we do the same thing like we always do we preheat our garment just until there's no way by evaporating anymore what we can't do with the subway light sublimation is we cannot put one transfer on top of each other this this does not work because we always look for hot peel not with a cold peel or we could understand it besides the printer if not i just repeat so with the subtly light actually all the subtle products besides the superflex 202 we do have a hot peel just put this over here place it down don't move it anymore then you want to press it i can just decrease the pressure a little bit about 20 25 seconds this way so if i can and just put it like that it's always a little bit strange to print black on black you barely see the imprint but the imprint is here just to attract the foil later on we use this sapling finishing foil right over here that's the size that you can scratch cover it up and press again for about 10 seconds so what we can't do over here is we cannot put color on top of color on top of color because why would if while we're peeling hot we would remove actually a part of the foil that was there in the first place what we have to do if we want to work with different colors we basically just cut them all at once and place them on our artwork right now in this stage so what we have to use with sublimation is basically hot stamping for it of choice let's use the rainbow again then we have to cut out all the parts that we want to foil so let's just use this one over here let's drop over there and put it on here then we use the green one this color over here place it over here but not all of it just a little bit just over there what we also can do is we can create vintage effects with this foil by merely crumbling it will just make a nice ball like if you would play with a cat just see if you can just just get you a better view of it so it's really nice and crumbled over here we place that on top of this part of our printout and the rest i would say we cover up with gold just like this cover it up and press again for at least 10 seconds there would be 20. right how many colors do you have on stock do you remember um i i think about 24 maybe i don't know if that's right actually i know we have a lot we have a lot so while this one is pressing actually it's already finished just open this one up this subtle flex 202 is now cold so now we can basically just peel it right when we peel it the best way to peel it is in a flat angle just like this let's do it yeah that looks good so you can see what i'm doing so there we go we just peel it like that we push it down a little bit with our hands and then we have basically no too little resistance when you peel it off so it's actually very simple to do so now this is a little bit glossy a little bit shiny as it is right now and if you want to mat this down and get a little bit more wipe and cut to put it back into our heat press and press it again and while this goes ultra press and cools down we just repress this shirt over here so we have here our matte finish paper put that on top and with the sub reflex 202 you really want to make sure that the neck is not in the heat pressure with even pressure and what you also can do is to cover it up with a bunch of copper papers or parchin papers to really get high pressure on your print so i'm using like five to six sheets increase the pressure a little bit which way and press it for about 15 to 20 seconds this one is already cold we can peel this off but let me just first show you the sapliflex 202 put this inside now this print is finished the black's got a little bit deeper because we pressed it and the dice could develop completely just do your close-up cam close-up look over here and because it's dyed all the way through it's really really long-lasting just a little bit sharper there we go so this is a great way to create photographic artwork the semi-gloss finish on cotton garments with a sublimation printer it has a heavier feel to it because it is essentially heat transfer vinyl but for open artwork like this this is great the only thing i would avoid with it actually is scratch the only thing i would avoid with it would be like square outfits like say you do a photo of somebody and it's really a square then it would feel like a huge piece of plastic that's something you would want to avoid this material but open graphics like this it's great especially on hoodies and sweatshirts so let's just see how this one turned out just go back with the zoom so here we are when we peel this you can just take it i place my camera on the shirt over here peel this one off peel the rainbow foil off over here as well and i think it's just coming a little bit better this is the vintage effect and this is the regular one and let me just show you the wind effect close up because it's really interesting so let me just change the camera so now we can see actually all the crumbles that we've had in the foil we can see in our printer over here just try to get a little bit closer to it and this can create really neat vintage effects the same one has had no crumbles over here this is all nice this one here has all the crumbles so depending on what kind of design you like you can adjust this to your liking spot are there any further questions that i could answer you um i do have a couple of questions um so candy says she has a gx7000 rico will it work with that printer yes okay uh the gx7000 are basically like the predecessor of the sg800 yeah some thousands of the bigger ones the tablet printers yeah the biggest issue here is just that there are no profiles available from sawgrass for these machines so what you do is you print with high quality settings just make sure your artwork are just strong bold colors and especially on blue you just want to add a little bit of magenta into your blues because blue by its own on your on the older ecos don't transfer as good as on the saw grass with the profiles okay and um jerry says when would you choose the subliflex 202 over the subla light and jerry anytime you're doing like a photograph or um going on to a dark cotton or dark shirt is i when i would go with subtle flex 202 yeah absolutely correct every time like i would prefer the subtly light for everything that it works with like it's self-reading it's softer it's actually cheaper and works faster because you don't have to cut and you don't have to weed but it has some limitations like with only a full tone color artwork like this one that we have over here for example or like the godzilla design that i made a couple of days ago over here right this one's straight just move it over here in my preview this one works great with the subtly light light card garments and bold full tone colors every time i don't have bold fulton colors like i have lighter shades or i do have a darker garment i tend to work this up the flex dual too okay so i have um i'm gonna split back to both of us so i have um jason asked how long would the gloss last on the silvoflex 202 if you don't double press actually the gloss lasts pretty long it doesn't it doesn't come off um if you like additional gloss you can actually use also the gloss finishing sheet it's super glossy but your cross making sheet wears off over time while the natural gloss or the base cloth from the sub effects 202 will not wear off over time typically but you have to do that that second press is what kind of into it yeah yeah so also increase the durability and so it's highly recommended to do a second press yeah and um i somebody asked if there was a cheat sheet to refer to all the different settings for each product we actually have that on our website so if you go to the products page on our website it has all of the instructions and videos for everything so yes yeah we also have on forever's youtube page if you go to forever underscore transfer you can find also tutorial videos about this update light about how to set up your colors correctly with a photograph and we should another printed color software because there are no education profiles for it how you check your colors so there's quite extensive tutorials in it you just need to take some time to watch them because they're pretty lengthy i think like 15 20 minutes yeah that's okay but you know they're they're very informative less time than watching me for an hour right now wow we have enjoyed it very very much and thank you so much for your time um everybody thanks for watching sorry about the little glitch on facebook but this will be available to watch later um so check it out on youtube check it out on our facebook and christopher thank you again this was this was fantastic thank you sprite thank you county clients i really enjoyed it until", "AkGBMYyzxRM": "hi welcome to another educational video about screen printing my cat spit productions today's video was a heat-transfer video and I wanted to just talk a little bit about the heat transfers again you know the first couple videos I did on these these avery transfers that you can get at Walmart you can get them you know staples Walmart Office Depot all those kinds of places that carry this kind of thing this is a package of eight-and-a-half by eleven there's six sheets in here I think I got these for about seven dollars you know six and change seven dollars something like that okay and these are just good to have around and and I don't use I don't do any heat transfers for commercial purposes like for selling shirts I don't do any digital heat transfer so I just use these for prototyping which is what we're going to do today or just when I want to make a shirt for fun you know bootleg shirt of something that you know you don't want to set up to prank because it's not yours you just want one shirt you know that's fine but I don't do he transfers on a commercial level the only heat transfer as I do on a commercial level for my customers are the the vinyl film the thermal films for names and numbers that would be on the back of the shirt you know for like athletics and stuff because it's practical rather than all the labor of screen-printing different names and numbers okay but today I'm doing a prototype deal we have have the artwork up in Corel and here's a test print to see that would film on paper right and we flipped it meaning that we reversed the image in the computer so that we print it out and it's reversed like this okay so you get good light on that you see it's reversed so that when we flip it around and place it on the shirt it will be correct okay so that's that's thing you can see Avery has the backside which is if you can see that has you know markings on it so you know which side the print you print the side that doesn't have any Avery printing on it and I've got the craft paper this time finally right we got I got a piece of craft paper which is kind of like a heavy wax paper that can take Heat and we've got the shirts I just use these I like these I'm in Arizona it's very hot I just use these Hanes undergarments and I like these they're very lightweight and they're great for me out here in the desert where it's hundreds of degrees you know so I just use these you know and we have the winter this is good thing to have you gotta let the shirt make sure there's nothing on there get trapped between the transfer because that's lame and I've got scissors and the other thing I wanted to say about this design that you can actually see is I put the big grey oval behind there and the reason why I did that is because I didn't you know it's not a weeding paper doesn't weed out so it would leave adhesive all in these areas so I put a big grey circle so that I could cut it out I'm going to trim it out in a circle okay so let me trim this out and I'll be right back okay so here I cut it I trimmed it and you can see a circle is nice and easy to do that's why I dropped it behind there as opposed to if you guys remember the love shirt right which was very difficult to cut out an intricate design to cut out this shirts been washed and worn several times many times I don't know several dozen times and we're going to show you the close-up of the two transferred shirts I'll show you this close-up when it's done and that one so you can see them side by side and let's move in for the transfer okay so remember that these are avery inkjet heat transfers for light garments you can print them out on any inkjet printer but they do not work on black t-shirt so these are only for white or very light colored garments and you know use your roller I already lent it mine and got it in position so I got all the stray fabric and lint or anything okay we're gonna put this down right and these are like I said they're a 'very inkjet heat transfers they're designed for use at home with an iron so you can use an iron but the heat if you use a heat press application is going to be way better it's going to last longer it's going to look better and it's just way better with an iron it's going to be difficult okay and it's important also to remember that Avery makes cold peels and hot peels this is a cold peel so we have to let it cool and then peel it you know but I've used other Avery's in the past where you peel it hot so always read the instructions here's the craft paper we're going to put that down we're going to press it for about 30 seconds and then we'll be right back guys it's about a 30 seconds we're gonna lift it off and now we're gonna let it cool okay little vapor from the shirt looks okay it's not scorched we'll let it cool and feel it okay here we are how'd you get the corner going because the cold peels are a little harder to do I don't like the cold peels as much okay because you let it cool down and then you gotta peel it and it's it just peel it's a little harder to peel and I just I prefer a hot peel because it just kind of melts off you know it just pulls off so easily and you do it right away it's a lot faster and I don't know I don't know why this everyone is a cold peel I remember the other ones I believe her hot peels so make sure you look at the instructions and yeah the cold peel is going to be a little bit harder to to get off like you know you got to get it started so it was hard to get started I had to tear it up in a couple places to get it started and then you know and then I'm able to peel it off so it's pretty cool I I just prefer the hot feels so let's show you close-up of the two shirts okay so there you go you have the two shirts side-by-side you can see the love shirt is in pretty good condition they when you do them with a heat press that seems that they work out really good and it lasts a long time okay so that's it this is just was just a prototype shirt okay that I wanted to do just to test out this design alright that's it thanks a lot for watching cats bed productions educational videos about screen correcting I really appreciate you checking out my videos and we'll see you next time thanks for watching you", "Nf0Luh35YXw": "[Music] hey guys it's me again says alene and my friend with a nice dress so today in this video we're gonna show you how to do an all-over t-shirt sublimation using app Xpress m110 just like my shirt size here so let's get started so the first step is to measure the t-shirt that you will be something making on and then prepare your chosen design from any imaging software will be a little bit shorter track or something else [Music] so in this all-over sublimation we actually used Cuba eggs it acts as a self sticking ink to prevent ghost printouts on to the textile whereas the generic sublimation inks use sticky type of paper which actually costs more technically you don't really waste textile and paper when it comes to Cuban eggs secondly Cuba inks reduces the smoke while sublimating in comparison to sublimating with traditional inks so the experts m110 actually has an adjustable pressure system you can either tighten or loosen it depends on the material you will be subletting on [Music] [Applause] [Music] so in this all-over sublimation we actually used Cuba eggs it acts as a self sticking ink to prevent ghost printouts on to the textile whereas the generic sublimation inks use sticky type of paper which actually costs more technically you don't really waste textile and paper when it comes to Cuba eggs secondly Cuba inks reduces the smoke while sublimating in comparison to sublimating with traditional inks more importantly the ink transfer rate is almost at ninety percent and its color output is more accurate the Qi ink is much more beneficial compared to traditional inks so lastly Cuba sublimation inks are highly pigmented therefore it is less consuming compared to generic inks thus it saves you money and you save the environment [Music] [Applause] [Music] so the extras m110 is deemed an all-over solution for an all-over sublimation because of its advantage on its heat plates in size which is 85 by a hundred ten fifty meters and it smelled door type flat face thus you have to control over your all over sublimation and the pressure system since the Xmas Edmonton has actually the adjustable pressure system so there you have it guys if you want to know more about the experts m110 this amazing machine we attack scrap are actually done a previous video so you can actually go through our YouTube channel at text raff and like and subscribe and happy some be and if you also want to know more information about that all over sublimation but just like what I did on my shirt so do visit www.texasback.com thank you [Music]", "3qQ_oLd9tSA": "[Music] hi guys it's crystal welcome back to my channel you guys see my video the other day where I used bleach with sublimation on a colored t-shirt you already knew I was gonna try it out with the infusible ink Cricut has designed this new product which is cricket and fusible ink it's very similar to the way that sublimation works except for you don't have to have that really big printer you just got to buy the these transfer sheets that are around $12.99 awesome Cricut infusible Inc I use today was this right here so this is Shaylee and I use the black and this color right here so I've designed this out with Cricut design space so I will sure that file down below it's completely free if you're an Access member these were files that were already in Cricut and I sliced sunflower in half and then this little quote here was already there and I kind of shrunk it up a little bit that way they went next to each other now their shirt that we're using today is color and it's going to be the same that I used on the other ones it's the Gildan soft style i'll have them linked down below gilding soft style and they are 65% poly and 35% cotton so you really want a high poly count when it comes to this these shirts have worked out really well with sublimation so we're gonna try it today with the infeasible ink so let's go and get started so we're gonna use the big 12 by 10 Cricut ez press - today it's at 350 for 60 seconds attempt down a little bit because when you're working with cotton you can scorch it so that's why we're doing the 350 for 60 seconds so let's go ahead and prep our area so I've already got these weeded out and they're mirrored and really ready to go we need our big mat down here on the bottom just get this back a little bit so we need our big mat down on the bottom you're gonna need a piece of parchment paper down on the bottom by this end a really big roll from heat press nation so I'll have it linked down below but if you purchase the box Cricut does um they do supply pieces of butcher paper so it like this one right here is a four count it comes with four sheets one two three four it comes with four sheets of the butcher paper so it does come with all four sheets if it's a box or two it's gonna come a tip you're gonna need one of those I've already got one on the bottom this is gonna protect our match we need a piece of white cardstock to go inside our t-shirts I'm gonna go and get that going now this is going to protect the backside just in case any ink goes you're going to slide this in and we're gonna scoot this up in just a second so you want to take your lint roller you do not want to skip this step and you want to lint roll the front of your t-shirt I go ahead and just cover the entire thing because you definitely want to get bigger than an area then your heat press so you want to go do that now thing we want to repress our shirt so you want to put down your butcher paper first this is gonna protect your shirts I'm gonna press my temps not all the way up there but I'm gonna go ahead and pre press at this point alright so now that we've got that I'm gonna move this you want to let your shirt completely cool back down because if you try to put your design on here now you have a chance of the ink coming out and certain to work with the heat and you may mess that up and have an image where you don't want it alright so once again I've talked about using the Cricut ruler it is the 3 by 18 and I do it in this direction cuz it has these lines here the 9 inch mark is the middle it perfectly comes three inches down I get it right here at the top I just get it even I can check my armpit here and see the lines making sure those are even and then I'm just working from this area here so at this point I'm gonna go ahead and lay these down and they're gonna go right next to each other today we're gonna use some heat resistant tape because these kind of want to move a little bit I'm gonna go ahead and get them tape down so now I've got that moved up where we can see what we're doing we're gonna quickly go through here my camera is gonna die so I'm trying to work quick alright so I want to work and see where I'm at all right so say that looks good to me I'm gonna go ahead and take these down stay still I may move my ruler I'm gonna cover this up with my butcher paper I want to make sure this is on the mat so everything's on the mat it's covered with my butcher paper and now we're going to press 350 for 60 seconds light pressure just making sure everything's covered and hit go all right we're gonna slowly with it I slowly move our butcher paper and this is a warm pill so I'm gonna let it set for just a second so I'm gonna go ahead and lift it up at this point just like that all right super cute so you could leave it on the shirt just like this I think it looks really cute you can still see it enough now this may fade out just a tiny bit in the wash you've seen the results on the other one and maybe of my new because of the 35% cotton that it's not gonna cling to but a majority of this is gonna stay but let's try the bleach effect I love this oh I'll probably remake this shirt I definitely want to try to repress infusible ink I haven't tried that like I've done with a sublimation so I'm going to set this aside and we're going to try to repress this again later actually we're gonna go ahead and do that now we're gonna leave this one like this so we can wash it by itself without the bleach so let's go ahead and do it one more time but let's this one we're going to bleach [Music] it says but your paper I've always said parchment paper they're basically probably nothing the same but I I call them so if you hear me say parchment paper it's butcher paper alright we're gonna go ahead and pull it up at this point alright so you can see how light the flour came in I think the black did really well and it's definitely lighter let me bring in the shirt so this is the first one right here - lot darker than this side so I don't really recommend I mean if you want like a vintage worn out look it's gonna be fine but I wouldn't recommend it cuz look at the bright colors the first time let me switch it real quick hold on alright you guys can see this alright this is the first press this is the second press so I really don't recommend it I don't think it worked out very great that way so really just do the one press unless you like this worn down effect so what we're gonna do now it does work on colored t-shirts and I'm gonna wash both of these so we can see how well it'll hold up in the wash let's go ahead and take this outside and bleach this one and kind of see how that effects gonna look and then like I said I'll throw these in the wash and we'll come back and talk about the final results here we are with the Cricut in fusible ink t-shirt so this is going to be the same thing as like the sublimation t-shirts with bleach except for this is the Cricut infeasible ink now this is the second time we press this one the other one we're just gonna leave on the colored t-shirt and wash it as normal but this one we're gonna bleach and give it a worn out effect and see how it looks alright so first thing you want to do refer back to my first video if you need to is basically gonna be the same situation but you want to make sure this is gonna be super flat now if you want some really cool effects you could take and kind of wrinkle them up here here and there you can get some really cool effects okay so but all we're going to be doing is I'm gonna be creating this vintage looks I'm gonna be spraying here kind of creating some sweaters here and there so I'll first start with my splatters and all you need to do is unscrew your cap and you're gonna get like these blobs so watch this so you see how I get like a blob like that I'm gonna get more of a little spots like that now do not put a bag underneath but if you've heard of my first video you can put a bag in between this so that way you don't get nothing on the back but I don't and you'll see how the back looks whenever we get done now to kind of get like some little spritz ins I kind of do this and shake you see and I'm getting some look like that so I'm just kind of getting that look stuff going on first trying to get some splatters that they're on my sleeves so kind of got some spiders so this is what I have so far see how fast to search the bleach it's a really cool once again this is 6535 so you see those really cool spots like that so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to kind of work from here kind of splattering out a little bit so with it kind of twisted in it's more of a mist so I'm just gonna kind of lightly mist going around so you can do as much or as little as you want to to get different effects and you can kind of start slower and that's going to do with this one and then add more as I want to so it's gonna be like a more faded out look so I'm kind of lightly you can see how light I'm kind of spraying that all right so let's kind of let that do its thing so you can kind of see this this wet area here everything else is kind of just more got this crazy bleach looking so we're just gonna kind of let it do its magic and kind of watch it now what's really cool with sublimation and it looks like confusable inks gonna work the same way cuz it will not bleach out so wherever the in fusible ink is so this stuff will not bleach so this stuff right here the infeasible ink is not gonna bleach where the shirt will but look how cool that's looking so like I said you can do your designs however you want to refer to my other video to see how I can I did those I do not recommend 5050 let me show you what braids this again I've sprayed it like five times I've already done it and then washed it and it first started out this dark color here my dogs are fighting hey guys oh let's work together um all I did was this it just turned out to be a really hot mess I do not recommend the 50/50 I do for sublimation like on the white but don't do it with the color alright so you can see where this is going okay how cool that is just kind of a really really light so if I wanted to be super white I would leave it and let it continue to bake in the Sun and then take it in and wash it out but I kind of really like the way they turn out like this let me show you what the backs looking like so far it looks like this you can see the sputter marks you can see some dirt as well you see them blobs it looks cool so I'm really excited so here in a little bit I will shut this down as soon as you're done with this and if you're working on more shirts I recommend having like either like an ice especially with a hot outside guys he's gonna intensify the bleach so you don't want to do that you want like a tote of ice water in there and you can be diving these in your ice water to stop that bleach process while you're working on the next shirts so have you a bunch of them laid out on your cement and getting them done at one time and like I said throw in those as soon as you get it to where you want it to be to stop that bleach get it in some cold water so what I do is I have like my towels ready to go in the washer or have the washer empty as soon as I get inside I put them right into the wash and they're ready to go I'm gonna stop it right here and shut it down get it in the wash I'll meet you guys back at the craft room got the results in Bleach this one this one we did not and I washed it though this has been washed and you can see nothing has washed out I already knew this because this is similar to sublimation and the ink becomes one with a shirt and it will never wash out never fade now this was a 65% poly 35% cotton so whatever was on the cotton is gonna wash away because it will not stick but whatever stuck to the poly will stay and as you can see with these results I mean it didn't fade a bit look at that on the colored t-shirt how pretty is that and then you can see how that black looks bring that up so you guys can see and this shirt says the influence of a good teacher can never be erased it's super cute but I love how bright and vibrant these colors came out super cute once again these shirts right here and I'll have it linked down below to where I buy these from they're about two dollars and something each they are the Gildan soft style they are 65% poly 35% cotton but make sure when you're going through and purchasing these whatever color you're choosing make sure it says Heather so it says graphite heathered or coral Heather it has to say heathered with it or it's not gonna be that 65 it'll be like 50% so make sure it says Heather and Heather it is where it kind of looks like this instead of like a solid color it has this really cool look to it so this is just where we applied it on a color you'd want to do it on like these Lauder colors here and it looks good so just leaving it like that love it bin wash didn't come out and you'll wash it again and again and again one that I bleached out there I love how it came out you can make these shirts however you want to with this design if you spray just a tiny bit of bleach it would just be a little bit and did a few dots here and there you could totally switch up the look but I love the way this one came out it's kind of hard to get the whole thing in here but this did not fade at all so this image here the reason why it's lighter than the first if you remember this is the second time that we had pressed it so we use that same image and pressed it for the second time now had I just pressed this image right here and bleach this shirt it would be this bright so the first time I press it if that makes sense it would be this bright on here but since I did the second one gave it like this washed out throwing it away I got another really cool effect in fusible link will not bleach out so when you bleach your shirt this is not gonna bleach out and it's not going to wash out the exact same shirt it was the exact same color and we just bleached this one so let's go out and look at it and see how cool it came out look at all these different splatters and it's pretty cool because you can see where the tag was sitting but I really love the way that this one came out kind of skeet up the bottom so you can see it a little bit here this is how the bottom came out now check out the back now I didn't put a plastic bag in here if you go back to my first video if you don't want nothing on the back you simply just put a trash bag on the inside all the way up and it's gonna protect it so nothing can get on the back we did that with my daughter shirt and I don't like that she loves it but I don't like just a plain back because in the Front's bleached but if you want something like that put a trash bag in between works great you so much is gonna go through and it's I didn't spray any extra bleach on this this is just from the front but look when we did those spray lines this is how that came out it's really cool and I love like these big bleach spots up here at the top but it really came out super cool but that's the shirt so there's your final results so play with your excusable ink you can bleach on these shirts again I'm gonna have the site that I buy it from I'm not affiliated but I love them number one I could purchase it let's say okay today's Friday I did this last Friday if I purchased because I bought these last Friday if I purchased these on a Friday I'll have them on a Monday if I purchase these on Monday I'd have them Tuesday like I always have them the next day and they're based out of Texas so they're not too too close to me and I always have them like that so now it may take an extra day with you I don't know just depending on how busy they are but literally I have them the next day I absolutely love them recommend them and I always look around and I can usually find a coupon code or I hit their chat button and I'll ask them if they currently have one and they usually give me an extra five percent so they're really good but these shirts are $2.00 and I think it's like free shipping after like $50 I just do that every time and I get a ton of shirts let me go and bring in a few colors you can see bring my my paper out here that says what colors these are so I can't really tell you that this one right here which is kind of like this pink should they say heathered so they're gonna be like this look right here so at this pink I got this quarrel once again they're about two dollars and something you say to 26 to 40 this coral is really pretty so if you're looking at the heathered coral this purple here I don't remember like I said what the name of it is but I don't think it's just purple I love it it's super cute and what I did I buy two of each one and I get them a mediums because my girls now this one right here I accidentally ordered four of them and they're large for me I just needed one dozen ordering two of but I accidentally I guess clicked it I ordered four of them so I'm like so I'll put some of these down at my booth but I love this color and I tried to cancel but once you make your order they're literally getting ready to ship it out right away so you can't cancel so pay attention love this color the same one that I did with the sublimation that color and this is what it came out so if you do one like this this is how it would look now this is with regular sublimation that's how this color would look super cool right party showed you

how to make clothes shrink first and foremost obviously you want to try just washing them in hot water if that doesn't work and you want them smaller still you take your clothes put them gonna sink anything at all or you know anything that'll hold water boil some water on the stove in a tea kettle or a pot you know anything you have available once the water is boiling pour it over your clothes and let your clothing sit in the hot water until the water is cool once the water has cooled off be careful cuz the clothes might still be a little bit hot but wring them out just a little bit so you won't be dripping water on the floor before you take them to the laundry room throw them in the washing machine depending on how many clothes you have put the washing machine on whichever setting extra small small medium large you know depending on how many clothes you have wash them in the hottest water you can add your laundry detergent of course you know let them go through their cycle when they're done take the clothes out pop them in the dryer again on the hottest setting possible and pull them out and your clothes should be significantly smaller I am Rachel you choose this and that is how you shrink clothing", "HLyFIEzJUxA": "what is up everyone my name is Charlie with char media and today I'm going to be going over the top 4 best blank t-shirts you can use for your clothing line today so let's get to it [Music] alright so coming in at number 4 on my list is a brand called all Sal now when I started my first clothing line I use them first and I can honestly say that they are a great starter brown and what I mean by that is there are there are other brands on my lists that are going to beat them out but the great thing about all style is they're not that expensive and they have several different styles to choose from which is always good when you want to really create a brand that has tons of different shirt colors like if you wanted heather gray Heather black white and all that stuff I know a lot of the brand's you would think would have all these colors but believe it or not some of these brands actually lack color so all style has a great selection to choose from they are great on price I think I remember paying around anywhere from four to six dollars per shirt and the more shirt to buy keep in mind the better the price gets and I I think I typically ordered around 40 shirts so the price wasn't bad even ordering for t-shirts so anyway all styles a great starter brand and that's why they're number four on my list alright guys so third on my list is a brand called Delta now I actually used them right after all styles so I switched from all style to Delta and I can honestly say I really really like Delta I had a great experience with them they even sent me some free sample shirts before I ended up purchasing several different orders from them but they have really good feeling shirts and when you put them on you feel really comfortable which you don't really get from a medium to low range shirt you know like a high range shirt would be American Apparel or something like that so Delta really held up as far as quality goes now the one downside I will say about Delta is they don't fit true to size and that really really ticked me off when I was buying shirts I didn't know that at first cuz the shirt that I bought actually ended up fitting quite nice so I didn't really think that I would need to worry about the sizing or anything like that but um a lot of my customers were saying that they didn't fit true to size so I would have a girl buy a small and she said she needed an extra small now but she normally wore small so anyway I had a lot of complaints about them not fitting true to size so that is one downside to Delta but if you guys can just keep that in mind it's really not a problem you just order a little bit more you just order one size above what you normally order and that's completely okay or just stock every single size and that would fix the problem as well and then let people know on your website that they fit a little small but other than that they fit great the ink really stayed in the shirt really well even after a months of washing the shirt I noticed so that's another good thing and the price isn't bad as well it's around the same as all style and like I said the prices could have changed so you have to check their wholesale account on their website but that was number three on my list and I definitely recommend you guys check and Delta out because like I said they are a brand that I've stuck with for a very very long time alright so coming in at number two on my list is a brand called American Apparel and I'm sure you guys have heard of them because they're very popular but the bad news is they are definitely on the pricier side I've actually bought a few of them and I can tell you right now they're definitely more pricey than all the other shirts I've used for my clothing line but the good news is they are very good quality so that kind of makes up for the more expensive wholesale prices and another thing is they're very popular so people might want to buy your clothing line more because they know that you print on American Apparel because chances are somebody that's buying one of your shirts has already wore a American Apparel shirt so they have that confidence already built up but other than that I think it's a great shirt too if you can get past the price and all that stuff I would definitely recommend going with American Apparel especially if you really want that quality the one downside that I see with them and this is just my preference is the shirts do feel a little thick on and that's just something I'm not a big fan of and they're a little more fitted than I would like them to be but I like my shirts a little bit bigger like I wear a large but I couldn't fit a medium you know so that's just my preference so if you can get past all that I definitely recommend them alright guys so coming in at number one on my list is a brand called Toltecs now this is literally my favorite brand to purchase wholesale blank t-shirts from and the reason why is because they literally have one of the best quality t-shirts I have ever worn in my life and the price is great as well so to me in my opinion this is the goat sure for any clothing line no matter if you're one of the BigDog clothing lines or one of the startups it does not matter this brand is literally the best so definitely Toltecs is number one because I have not only used them before but I've had so many customers tell me that they love the shirt the way it fills and the just the quality of it and everything like that and also the ink stays in the shirt really nice so you don't you know after a few washes the inks not going to look all shitty or anything like that so anyway it is literally one of the best blank t-shirts you can buy and that's why it's number one on my list so that does it for this video guys if you liked what you saw today please consider subscribing if you haven't already and don't forget to hit that thumbs up and also let me know what kind of brands you guys like to print on in the comments section below and I will see you guys in the next one thank you so much for watching", "zUSdiaahPaE": "how to shrink a t-shirt option one the washing machine pop open the Machine and set it to the hottest water temperature next wash your shirt dry it thoroughly using a medium heat set finally wear would drive option to boil some water step 1 Royall a large bottle once it's boiling remove it from the heat toss in your shirt let the shirts soaked in the water for around 5 minutes now drain the water let the shirt cool off wring it out and let it dry voila your once oversized shirt now fits like a glove", "2AOnHPxoLDs": "[Music] setting everybody boy big brando and today let's talk about a standard street wear t-shirt now as most of you guys know if you've been watching my videos or you've seen a bunch of my videos where i talk about blank t-shirts i always say it's a personal preference when i say personal preference i mean people have different ideas of what quality is how shirts supposed to fit what they want to offer their customers what they like in a t-shirt what they don't like all of that stuff plays a big role in ordering blank t-shirts but on this channel i always talk about running a brand from home i don't know much about running like a fitness brand or running different brands like with unisex t-shirts and stuff like that i don't offer any female t-shirts one of the big reasons why i don't offer women's t-shirts is because there's way too many options and you got to remember every woman is shaped differently and at the same exact time women respond better when they can try something on because sometimes they might wear medium but then sometimes in certain shirts they might wear a large or might be opposite maybe they wear a medium in certain shirts and then a small insert shirt so that range is very hard to gauge i personally don't offer exchanges and returns on my online stores so it's hard for me to send a shirt to a female that has to try it on before she buys it or if i'm vending it's hard for a female to pick up a shirt and be like yeah this is gonna fit me because sometimes their chest size might be a lot bigger or a lot smaller but their body size might be the same as somebody else so it's gonna make wearing the shirt a lot different also there's tank tops racerbacks halter tops crop tops unix v-necks crewnecks slouch necks there's so many different options when it comes to female shirts that it is very overwhelming so for myself i stay away from women's t-shirt and that's why i stay away from them because there's way too many options and it's hard to get the sizing right for females on top of that printing on t-shirts for women very hard also you gotta remember i use a standard rule of putting four fingers down laying the design down on a women's shirt a lot different if they're using a v-neck you can't do that five-finger down thing because then the design is going to land over their chest and then it might stretch it out depending on the size of their chest also if you put a design on there sometimes the chest might be a little bigger where the design wraps under and it's not really being showcased sometimes it's stretched out sometimes it doesn't land in the correct spot to be legible you know what i mean so for those reasons i stay away from women's shirts so let's get back and talk about a standard streetwear t-shirt a lot of people say hey i want to start the streetwear brand what's the best blank to you you got to remember there's a ton of different ideas of what street wear is you got that high fashion street wear stuff that's like fear of god and off-white and all those other brands and they might have some sort of like premium feel and then you have street wear that's kind of like the old like hundreds and diamond kind of skate street wear sneakerhead streetwear type of stuff so for myself i like to take the middle road of streetwear the streetwear companies that did like graphic tees like the hundreds and diamond and crooks and castles and a lot of these other brands undefeated all of those brands have really really cool standard street wear feeling t-shirts right not really like the high fashion stuff but it's also um like an everyday wear t-shirt for me that's what i like to compare when it comes to street wear that's what i'm thinking about so if you were trying to create a brand like that or you wanted a t-shirt similar to that i would suggest the all style 1301 this t-shirt right here let me see if i can focus in all style classic all style 1301 same exact thing very standard cut very standard fit very generic t-shirt so for myself if i was doing a street wear brand or i needed just a generic style t-shirt that's true to size it's not form fitting it's not really super baggy it's not heavy weight but it's not lightweight it's kind of in between it'll be considered a heavyweight t-shirt but compared to like real heavyweight t-shirt like pro club this shirt is not as heavy as that feels good on body straight generic fit a lot of your favorite brands use this same blank a lot of your favorite brands based their blanks around this t-shirt like if you ever took this t-shirt blank to the mall and you compared it to like the hundreds logo t-shirts or if you compared it to diamond or whoever else you're into or any of those skate street wear type brands chances are it's going to look and feel similar to this 1301 and i'm not saying i know exactly what blank every company uses there's always people that hit me up and they're like hey man you know what blank does off-white use what blank does supreme use i have no idea i just go based off of feel and fit right so if you wear a lot of supreme stuff obviously you know the fit and feel of a supreme t-shirt so buying a blank you would compare it to that right i personally don't wear supreme t-shirts so i don't know what it feels like i don't know what it fits like i don't know who they use but i have bought stew c t-shirts before i've bought the hundreds t-shirts before undefeated crooks and castles a lot of these other brands i've bought their t-shirts i've seen what they feel like i've wore them like a lot of brands in hawaii defend hawaii hawaii's finest a lot of these t-shirt companies use the same exact t-shirt these all-style t-shirts man so i know the fit i feel i i understand it i know my size in it if i was doing like street wear type of brand this is the t-shirt that i would use and this is the t-shirt i recommend a lot of people when they say they want to start a streetwear brand and they're looking for a good blank this is a perfect example of a t-shirt to use now there's a lot of people that are gonna be like well all right what's the best workout t-shirt or what's the best tri-blend t-shirt or moisture wicking t-shirt i have no idea i use 100 cotton t-shirts for all my brands i like to buy the t-shirts that my customers like to wear none of my customers wear tri blends or dry blends or moisture wicking shirts so i have no idea the best advice i could give if you wanted to do that or if you wanted a form-fitting t-shirt or if you're looking for a more lightweight ring spun cotton t-shirt is to order samples you could go to companies like alpha broder and tsc mission imprintables sanmar all of these third-party suppliers carry a bunch of different brands under one roof if i were you i'd create accounts with them and then i'd buy one t-shirt that is you know bella canvas and one that's next level one gilding and one all style in my size and the color i wanna offer and then i'd wear it press on it test it out so that way you have an understanding on what t-shirt you want to offer and what you're looking for out of these t-shirts asking some idiot on youtube like myself what i prefer and i tell you all style 1301 you go and you buy a shitload of these and you're trying to do like some fitness brand or something like that geared towards people that work out and you're like man this t-shirt's heavy it's thick it's stiff i don't like this shirt you asked me what t-shirt i recommend and i'm giving you a t-shirt that i recommend but you have a different idea of what you want so you have to just do your own research when it comes to these blank t-shirts this video is for the guys that are talking about street wear style t-shirts i'm not talking high fashion street wear i'm not talking i'm talking just that regular ash street wear regular generic fitting t-shirt you can't go wrong with this all style 1301 the classic all-style t-shirt you can also find these at your local swap meet a lot of times they go by aaa because the name is all style apparel and activewear triple a aaa their old logo used to be like a big a and then there's like three little a's in there that used to be their logo so the t-shirt was called aaa if you want to swap me t-shirt warehouse stuff like that they'll have them that's usually the generic you know three for 10 t-shirt that you could buy or whatever it is so once again basic street wear generic fitting t-shirt all style 1301 is a good t-shirt i know there's going to be a bunch of people what do you think about the gildan 9301 or whatever t-shirt that could be comparable i have no idea right i have no idea about any other t-shirt all style is the what this video is about that's what i'm talking about all style right now i don't get paid by all style this is just because i always get comments asking about i want to start a streetwear brand what t-shirt do you recommend it's easier for me to just make this video and be like check it out man if i was starting streetwear brand tomorrow i'd be using all style 1301. reason being is just because it's true to size people that wear extra large will fit extra large people that wear double x will fit the double leg they understand this fit and feel because chances are they already have this t-shirt in their closet from some other brand this is a very generic t-shirt a lot of people use it same goes for like gilding a lot of people use gildan i hate the sleeves on gilding i hate the way that it's cut i hate that boxy feel of a gilding t-shirt this one fits me a little bit better that's why i use them all right hopefully this helps somebody out out there because there's a lot of people that hit me up if you ever cruise the comments of any of my videos chances are there's some guy that wants to start a streetwear company and he's looking for this blank and that's why i made this video was for those guys that are in my comments asking about streetwear t-shirts now if you're asking about what blanks all these companies use i have no idea i have a system on how i figure out how certain companies use their blanks it won't work for everybody but if i ever needed that information there's ways that you can look on youtube and find that information you got to do a lot of digging and searching but sometimes it's out there you know what i mean and the way i do it is whenever any of these companies have uh warehouse sales or whatever it is i look for videos of people going to their warehouse sales or sample sales or whatever it is and then they have the [ __ ] boxes stacked up in there if they're using all style t-shirts all the all style shirts are bagged up put in these all-style boxes they cut a hole in them so you can grab the shirts you're seeing what blanks they're using you know what i mean it'll be a shitload of gildan boxes or next level or or bella canvas or whatever company they use that's how i figure out what brands use certain blanks is just by searching their warehouse sales or end of the year sale or sample cell when they show their warehouse you're seeing the inner workings of what they're doing that's how i find out what certain brands are using what blanks because all the boxes are there right there's just like a shitload of all style boxes in their warehouse chances are they're using all style you can see the logo on the side of the box but there's also a lot of these companies that use their own cut and so program they have their own custom cut t-shirts and they're not using a generic blank or a already made blink so what you have to do is you have to try to compare certain blanks to what they're using to get something similar but it won't be exactly the same it's like trying to compare hats to new era hats you're not buying a blank new era hat what you're doing is you're buying a blank hat and trying to compare it to a new era hat trying to figure out how it fits and feels how the how the bill looks how high is the crown all of that stuff so same goes for somebody that's using you know their own cut and so program their own custom t-shirt program you're gonna have to get blanks and then match it up to that if you own that brand's t-shirts like i said if you own supreme and supreme uses their own custom t-shirt program you would have to buy some blanks and then match it up to your supreme t-shirt to see if you could kind of match up the fit and feel and get something close to it but you're not going to get something exactly like it if they're using their own program so hopefully this helps somebody out out there if you got any questions leave it in the comments follow me on

up gang Matt with Mikey Designs\nhere let's dive right into that tutorial ok guys in order to get a bright white\nprint on a black t-shirt the the shirt that we do have that we are using\nthere's a next level t-shirt I'm just going to go ahead and load it up on the\npallet as usual and we are using the shop gnome print we're using a 195 mesh\nwith our epic amazing white bright by will flex this is our go to ink and\nessentially if you want a nice bright white print you just print flash print\nwith your white we coated these screens one-on-one again we're using a 195 mesh\nthe brighter you want your white print the lower mesh you'll use but you'll end\nup using more ink we tend to like to stick to the higher mesh counts because\nwe're not using as much ink and you're still gonna get a bright white print and\nit have a little bit of a nicer feel to it so here we go I'm gonna go ahead and\nflood it using a fairly upright position I tend to like to do a push stroke and\nyou just want to make sure you completely clear your mesh as you can\nsee here our mesh is nice and clear and then there is our first print as you can\nsee it's a little marbled and that's to be expected because you're kind of\npressing the ink down into the fibers of the shirt we're gonna send this over to\nthe flash and then we're gonna go ahead and print it again okay we went ahead and flasher Inc\nnothing is coming up on my finger so I know it's ready to go\nit still has just a slight bit of tackiness you don't want to cure your\nink you don't want to flash it too long otherwise when you do your top print\nthat top print will wash out over time so we're just gonna give it a flood and\nthen we're gonna give it just one good firm press let's go ahead and try a\nsecond one if I see you like it it looks like you hadn't cleared quite completely\nnow it's nice and cleared and we have ourselves a nice white bright print and\nagain this is using a 195 miss let's see if I can get it to focus a little better\nthere we go and that's about it I mean just do a print your first print give it\na few two or three hits until your mess completely clears because we were using\na lower mesh it is a little harder to clear if you're using a 110 a couple\nhits or maybe even a hit well clear it just depends on how firm you are if\nyou're using a manual and automatic probably would clear it in just one hit\nbecause it can put more pressure down then you flash it and to give it one\nmore hit you just want to make sure you play\nyour mess and there you go guys I'm going to go ahead and take this off of\nthe pallet and toss it through the conveyor dryer and to cure ink we tend to like to run\nour somewhere around 350 just to make sure it completely goes through making\nsure the ink really completely goes through the entire layer of film curing\nit completely and here we go it's a nice bright Fred as you can see I'm stretch\nit doesn't crack and we got ourselves a nice bright white print the key to\ngetting a nice bright white print on a black t-shirt is to use a lower mesh\nscreen either a 1 10 156 195 even or 200 it just depends on how much pressure\nyou're putting down your squeegee angle will determine how much ink you're\nactually putting down give it a couple hits flood it hit it a couple two or\nthree times until the mesh completely clears and you're putting that eat into\nthe fiber of the t-shirt you don't want to press too hard that weight you're\nsqueezing the ink through the shirt down onto the palate\ngo ahead and flash that afterwards once you flash it it's nice and tacky there's\nnothing coming up on your finger be sure not to over flash it otherwise when you\ndo your top print that top print will wash out once you flash your underbase\nor your your first hit of ink go ahead and hit it again sometimes hitting it\nonce will work you just have to keep an eye on your mesh make sure all that ink\nis completely cleared that mesh if it hasn't to go ahead and hit it again\nuntil it's completely cleared the higher the mesh the harder it's going to be the\nclearer it and I hope this helps you guys thanks\nfor tuning in guys don't forget to

inkjet and laser transfer paper you can print any image on a shirt all you'll need is your image a printer heat transfer paper and an iron so sit back and we'll tell you how up next hey guys it's 1/2 a shirt space and today I'm gonna walk you through the step-by-step process on how to iron a picture on a t-shirt first and foremost the color of the shirt matters this may be one of the most important steps in the whole process with that said keep this rule in mind the lighter the image the darker the shirt adversely the darker the image so lighter the shirt now that you have your color picked out make sure you check your inkjet transfer paper for the specifications on what fabric you can print on ie cotton and polyester this is very important let's move further into the transfer paper discussion the shirt color that you've chosen will also affect the transfer paper that you choose for light colored shirts choose thin transparent transfer paper dark color transfer paper are meant to be used on dark-colored apparel you'll want to make note of any clear background in your image this will appear white after the transfer now it's time to print once you've printed your transfer paper make sure you turn any excess transfer paper as this will be transferred onto the shirt now let's get started on the ironing process first you'll want to pre wash your shirts once you've transferred the image on there you don't want it to shrink in its first wash once washed and dried lay your shirt flat on a table or hard surface iron your shirt to make sure you remove any creases or wrinkles cover the transfer paper with the backing that you've peeled off this acts as the parchment paper if you've accidentally thrown this away no worries you can use a soft towel as an alternative make sure you heat your iron to the specified temperature of the transfer manufacturer let's start to iron start in the center of your transfer paper working in a circular motion to the edge of the transfer and then back to the center again repeat these sets as many times as the transfer instructions in case this could take about three to four minutes now sit back and admire your ironing skills while it cools once cooled carefully peel back the parchment paper or the soft towels and make sure you start at the edge once cooled and the parchment paper has been removed you now

on my video today I really appreciate your time and attention and if you like what you see please make sure to subscribe to my youtube channel and if you need screen printing equipment or supplies please check out my offerings at cats fit screen print supply.com okay so today's video is about fibrillation okay and I wanted to just kind of talk about this a little bit and maybe demonstrate sort of because I'm not sure that I can really show it on the camera I don't know if I have anything that has fibrillation but what is fibrillation so sometimes you might notice and I think this is probably especially with plastisol inks when people tend to over work or over print the ink on the shirt you know we can see the fibers of the shirt raising up off of the knit surface and you know moving into the ink to where when you're finished curing it and you know printing it and carrying it and you look at it you can actually see the fibers in the ink you know the printed ink and this could be I think it's probably you know more visible on like you know darker shirts where the fabric is dark and you're printing a light-colored garment you know sometimes it can happen with black ink on a white shirt as well where the fibrillation can actually cause the ink to look faded fuzzy you know have a soft look and fur for it for the case of black ink on white shirts it can actually make the black ink look gray okay so fibrillation basically is when the the hairy fibrous you know parts of the knitted surface of your garment get raised off of the knit and become free and loose and able to be up into the ink and it's visible okay so one of the first things that I can tell you is that sometimes it's the garment like if you're printing on a very soft brushed knit that is actually the shirts knitted and then afterwards the fabric or the fabric is knitted and then afterward the you know afterwards the fabric might be brushed to give it a soft feel and that actually is raising some of the fibers off of the of the tight knitted surface you know so sometimes the shirt itself can be a problem with fibrillation and you may even notice it on like test rags shirts that you've had in a test box a box of tucks test rags you know for a long time then shuffling them around you know you go in there looking for a shirt that you can do a test print on and all that action and motion and you know there could be shirts in there a couple of years old you know so when you do test prints on red t-shirts from a box sometimes those shirts can show a lot of fibrillation in the Tusk print simply because the fabric is old or used sort of speak okay and it would be the same case with a washed fabric if you tried to print on a washed fabric you might see fibrillation as well but not only that your ink you know that's a whole nother topic for a video but ink doesn't like the bonds necessarily to wash fabric not not all the time all right so that's the first thing we can say is the shirt or the garment itself you have to look at the tighter than it is the smoother than it is the smoother and finer the knit and print surfaces of the shirt the less likely you are to experience fibrillation but what can you do on press to avoid fibrillation okay so I have my trustworthy cat's bit design and I just have a test rag on here because I'm just going to demonstrate you know a couple things that might cause fibrillation on a garment that might be prone to fibrillation you know because like I said the better the garment is the less likely you know you would have this problem and fibrillation can be seen either you know before you know right when you print the shirt when you lift the screen up or it can happen like after it's washed okay so you know something something to consider but it's not always a problem for everyone but one of the things that can cause it is overworking the plastisol ink on the screen and that's why you'll notice when I screen print I flood off palette I always flood off palette okay I don't even know if the screen is printing I just threw some ink on here and there's some I got something in my ink there it was probably on the screen okay so that's why you notice that I flood off palette because if you flood like this right say I flood like this yeah I don't know if you could guys can see it in the camera but because of the off contact and such as I'm doing this it's actually there you go it's actually you know pulling some ink through you see it that's what off contact is all about so it's actually pulling some ink through and so the more I do this and then I do my print stroke like this what we're actually doing is is causing a little bit of stencil drag in both directions and you know that's moving the fibers on the shirt we're agitating them sort of speak okay so that's something that you don't want to do necessarily some people do that they'll flood on palette but in my opinion this can you know encourage fibrillation so that's why instead of flooding on palette just lift the screen slightly hold it flood with one hand put it down do your print stroke and be done with it okay and that's the other thing is you want to try to get the print off in as few motions as possible so you want to you know not overwork the print don't don't keep setting the screen down and pray it again and again and gun again you know what I'm saying you want to try to learn your groove and know how much to flood it like you might have to flood it the first time you're doing remember you know how I do my putty stroke I push it in a little then I lift it up the second time I do a lot less and I allow the off-contact to pull the ink through right and I want to achieve the print in as few motions or is it few actions as possible and that will also reduce the possibility of fibrillation okay so any kind of motion and you don't want to you know you don't want to do this either oh do a print stroke that way and a print stroke this slide that's the same difference because then you know you're moving the ink and the screen the stencil drag everything is moving in both directions and it's moving much more than if we just flood off palette and then do the print stroke okay so I think that's it really you know fibrillation is is it can be the garment itself and it can be overworking the ink on the screen and finally possibly in some cases it could be the ink if the ink is just so super thin it may not have the opacity or the ability to handle very soft brushed fabrics okay and the other thing that you can do if you see fibrillation on the first print like especially with white on black is you could do a print flash print and usually in most cases the print flash print seals it up really nice because because the fibrillation is active in the first layer like you know you do your first print and blah blah blah blah blah and if you see some fibrillation flash cure it solidify or gel it right and then do another cover print over it and it should cover that fibrillation okay so those are my tips on fibrillation so I was just shooting a video about print resolution and print clarity and I did this really flooded out it's where I overworked the ink on the black shirt white ink on a black shirt and this is as close eye as I can get with the camera but you can see I think you can actually see the black fibers are raised not only does the print look like crap and it's all flooded out but the black fibers are actually raised into the ink the on the printed ink surface so that is what fibrillation is and like I said it can happen you know right away you can see it like this or it can happen after you wash the shirt the fibers can come through the ink like that so just trying to show you an example here because it's hard to do without having like a macroscopic camera capability that's all I have for you today I hope you enjoyed this video please remember to check out cats fit

they're available HMS nation.com", "-_3u55y3gm0": "[Music] hi guys it's crystal welcome back to my channel today I want to show you the updated version of the Cricut easy Press reference guide so I figured I would show you using the two different heat settings so what you're gonna do now you can see that they have where you can click on easy press two or the first easy for us how amazing is that so you just click one or the other we're gonna click the easy press two then for your materials you're gonna see there is so much more so they have added tons of different products so now you can see the mesh is on there the fusible ink pens and the transfer sheets are now there we're gonna choose the everyday iron on light hit done and then for the material that you're gonna put it on there's so much more now so look at this I mean there's just everything is on here they even have the stuff once again for the infusible we're gonna choose 100% continent and hit done so now we're going to choose the easy press nuts or you can choose town and we're going to hit apply and now look at this it shows in more detail what you need to do so it says 315 for 30 seconds you can change it from Fahrenheit to Celsius just by clicking the button we're gonna use Fahrenheit and then on this next image here now what it's also going to tell you light pressure and keep warm peel right away at the top then on the next picture is going to show you how to layer it it's gonna tell you what supplies you need Preparation how to prepare your item the application is going to tell you how to apply it the heat all of that information and then it's going to tell you the care so allow it to sit for 24 hours before you wash it I highly recommend that you do that that really does help it says you do not bleach etc so that's how you use them you guide I'm really excited about it so we're going to go ahead and set our machine at 315 for 30 seconds okay so now I know about where I want my image to be I'm gonna remove everything and go ahead and preheat my shirt for five seconds I'm going to use my three by eighteen ruler get that even on there then I can go by the center which is the nine inch mark I can come down and work my way from left to right and that's gonna be perfectly centered I absolutely love this really for this all right I'm gonna pull off all the other layers and start going so I'm gonna do about half the time just to get this temporary tacked down and I'll just keep going adding layer by layer now I'm going to use a Teflon sheet in between just to protect my other pieces of iron on and just keep going [Music] [Music] now that we have all of our other iron on we're gonna switch tick litter so I'll just come back into the settings I'm going to choose glitter it gives us 334 30 seconds I'm going to adjust my ez press and start layering on my winter [Music] I'm gonna flip the shirt over and I'm going to go ahead and do an extra 15 seconds so it's gonna ensure that it lasts and there you have it super cute", "vfZ0HP2E1Pk": "hi guys Debbie here I'm just getting ready to do a shirt and I've had a lot of people asking for tutorials on sublimation and so I thought this would be a good chance to show you how to press a sublimation transfer on a t-shirt or tank top or for the most part any fabrics but the t-shirts seem to be kind of the trickier ones and there's a few little tricks that I've learned they make it a little easier so we're gonna start on the computer just to show you some print settings and how to set it up and and then we'll go from there okay so we're starting on the computer and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to open up a new document and show you right from beginning on how to set it up in case this is the very first time you're printing a transfer I use silhouettes to do so there'd be a whole different set of steps if you're wanting to promote different software but basically when you open it chances are it's going to look like this with your mat they're probably not that so you open it up and it's gonna look like this what we want to do is drag in the design so I'm doing a buffalo plaid mama bear tank top and I want the ping file so if it'll load and tell me what that is well I'm thinking this one yeah so the ping files have transparent backgrounds and that's ideal that there's usually JPEGs available too but the white background sometimes can be a different color and you don't even realize it just barely tint in a different color and then it'll it'll print with a different color so the transparent backgrounds are really the ones that you want and they should be a minimum resolution of 300 dpi which is dots per inch and that's the resolution anything less than that I mean 240 is probably okay but less than that you're going to start to see a pretty big reduction in quality but you just drag the design right into silhouette studio and then you want to set it up to print because we're not cut so this when I do these tank tops I've done enough of them that I do them all 11 inches wide so if you come over here to the transform panel and then this little diagonal arrow looking thing it'll let you select on the graphic and then change the size so you hit the little lock aspect ratio and you change the width to 11 inches and then we can want to go back to the page setup I'm gonna turn the cutting mat off I mean it really is a big deal if it's on but it just bugs me and then we're gonna turn the cut border off but show print order is a big deal because you'll it's gonna tell you if it's gonna print like right now if I printed this see the line the this stuff outside that border won't print even if your paper has plenty of space it will not print if it's outside that border so the border is going to tell you if you've got some sort of print settings that are not set up the way that you want now so this is 11 inches wide I need to do it on 13 by 19 sheet of papers so that it does the whole thing because in 8 and a half by 11 there's the print border goes in just a little bit and so I can't actually make it the full 11 and I actually wanted to show you how to print on a scrap anyway so we're gonna set it up for a 13 by 19 I uh 13 by 19 and 8 and 1/2 by 11 sublimation paper that's the only sizes that I buy I just haven't had the need to get anything in between but there's there's lots of different sizes that you can get but set it to 13 by 19 and then we want to fix this border right here so we're not gonna print it yet but go up to file print and make sure you choose your printer so I have the WUF 77 20 and then you go into preferences and I have pre-set saved so I can just come in here and click on 13 by 19 and it'll have everything that I want but I'll walk you through how to do it so I always print out a paper cassette one just because the settings that I use aren't available on paper cassette to the premium presentation mat if I was if I change this to number two I went to the type the premium presentation mat isn't an option so I put it on cassette one I choose the paper size so 13 by 19 I do it portrait but obviously you can change that to whatever you need and then you go to your paper type and go premium presentation paper mat and then go into quality and hit hi and I think that's it for this tab the borderless I don't turn on one it pops up with a warning and says that the quality might not be as good are on the edges but the issue that I've run into is the sizing tends to be off a little bit and I do print and cut sometimes or I do it alongside vinyl and I want to make sure that it's exactly the size that it should be and when I print borderless it seems to stretch it or something so I keep order less turned off so that's why there's this little line here that doesn't go all the way to the edge of the paper and why I'm doing this on a bigger sheets which I can obviously shrink shrink it down a little bit more but I'm just showing you this way anything so second tab this this document size is going to just automatically match what you had on the first tab color correction you want to go into advanced and hit ICM that's like the internal color profile for the printer itself so it's just the default it's gonna let it use the settings that Epson has set for the printer without having any special changes being made by the software so turn on ICM and then down here turn off high-speed and turn on mirror image by turning on mirror image it's going to automatically mirror it for you so you don't have to do it you never have to worry about forgetting to mirror and with sublimation it needs to be mirrored because you put the design face down onto whatever you're putting it on and so if you don't wear it everything will be backwards so highly suggest clicking that and saving a preset so the preset you can come in here at remove presets and once you have everything set on that screen you could just give it a name and hit save I already have some in here but then that just makes life a lot easier for you so thirteen by nineteen Kosmos that's the ink that I use I did have different ink and so I started saving with Cosmo so I know which ink because some of the settings were different with different inks so if you don't use Kosmos ink do some tests Walmart has fabric for a dollar ninety-nine a yard hundred percent polyester I've done hundreds hundreds and hundreds of tests compare and write it down very carefully and figure out what setting works better best for your ink but for the cosmos this was definitely the best for shirts now I changed up a little bit for mugs but fabrics and stuff the premium presentation met so anyway you hit OK when you hit apply but then you hit cancel don't hit print yet so hit cancel and if you look you see that the print border changed that's what you need to look for if you did something wrong in those settings and that print border isn't lining up like this you need to go back and look at them again this is basically the print border is going to tell you if something's messed up and it happens so I highly suggest turning that on so we have the design and I'm just gonna go all the way up see zoom in just inch it up to the edge here and because I'm kind of OCD we're gonna hit the center button so that it just makes placement easier when you're doing the shirt so I'm centering it and there it's good that's how I want it so we're gonna go back to file and print and hit print except I'm going to show you how to set up the printer first then I'll hit print okay now we need to set up the printer to make sure that it's doing what it should in order be printing the right thing with the computer is gonna be sending it so by default the tray is all closed up so you need to since we're doing the bigger sheet of paper pull it out there's a blue tab over here pull the tab and it'll let me extend the whole thing out and you need to have this one pushed back and this one pushed all the way back so you have the full tray size for the 1319 paper if you're using a different size just look at the lines on here and line them up accordingly now I'm not actually gonna put 13 by 19 in here because I am going to print on a scrap because a lot of people have asked me that so we're dual purposing this little this is 13 inches wide but I cut it off I was probably a pillow I have a lot of squares we're gonna pull off the side there's kind of so I'm gonna use a scrap and you just push it all the way up where the paper would be and you make sure your design is up on the top and paper so prints first and then the rest of its blank the printer will just push it out this blank there's nothing that's trying to do there just make sure there's no design that's going to go down beyond where there's no paper and I'm using a sub paper I get it on Amazon it works great and there's a pattern on the back so you want to print on the white side so you put it facedown you should see the pattern then you know you have it loaded right then push it in and you need to tell the printer what size you're loading don't tell them into scrap just put 13 by 19 in here so 13 my 19 is actually called Super Bee or a 3 plus so for paper size you choose that and for paper type you choose premium matte and it's actually working up on my screen and I have it saved as a paper favorite paper setting if you want to save it go into favorite paper settings choose which setting number you want and then you'd hit edit and go in and choose everything and then hit safe but I already have mine all sorts I'm not going to do that but I choose super be premium Matt okay use and they'll pull those settings in and you get close and you're good to go hold this out because otherwise it goes flying across the room I have my printer up on a big tall dresser it's the only place I have room for this giant printer but pull this out and then it'll catch it for you there's a little on the lid that comes with these I took them off the first day I started printing it's it's not necessary and it was just driving me nuts having to take a lid and put it back off so I keep the lid off all that out go over to either printer and hit print okay so the transfers printed what I like to do now I know I censored it on the page so I'm not really gonna worry about the left and right side but just to show you guys I usually cut it out as close to the design as possible so it's easier to line up on the shirt and I mean you can kind of see through the paper a little bit but sometimes it's just a little bit tricky so just for helping replacement I'm gonna cut off the extra on the bottom just so it doesn't kind of mess with my linemen so what I usually try to do is see the space that I have over here and match it over here with whatever is the lowest part so something like that and I just cut it I try not to put my ruler over that so I don't scratch the transfer itself and like I said I centered it in the software so I'm not gonna worry about trimming the right in the left but if it wasn't centered I would trim both sides too okay so one more thing you wanted to mention real quick make sure that you lint roller your shirt really well there's lint that gets on it in the factory or shipping or whatever and you can't even see it but it will show up blue when you press it and it's bad so lint brush lint roller to the front roll over the back go through a few sheets if you have to just to be extra careful that you don't get any of those little blue flecks on there and one more thing I just thought about the butt transfers I cut mine in squares like I showed you if you still have issues with the square of the paper showing up on the shirt you can try tearing the design out and it gives you kind of more of a feathered line that's a lot less noticeable on a shirt I haven't had to do that honestly I don't like doing that because I feel like I can't get it lined up as well and I got my pressure settings I'm Torri I don't have that problem but if you still have that problem try the tearing out thing that seems to work really well for people as far as the alignment I've heard some people will take a ruler or square and put like a plus sign or a big T on the back of the transfer really lightly in pencil so when you tear it you at least know how to get it level of where the center is but again I don't have to do that the foam kind of solve the problem for me but if you still have that issue that's just an idea if we're gonna try okay so now we can move on to the actual shirt process I do all my shirts and fabrics for the most part 400 degrees for 60 seconds I highly suggest checking the temperature of your press this beast for example is like 25 degrees too hot so I have all these little notes written on a piece of paper on the wall to get it to 400 days I have to set it to 377 so don't be confused by that you need it to be 400 degrees but little infrared thermometer works great make sure your platen is bare if you have tough long on the top it won't I won't read it correctly and you just aim it and press the button so it says 396 $3.99 so it just kind of depends this one is so big and it honestly it's a China piece of crap but it gets the job done but depending on where you shoot the thermometer on the Platinum the temperature is going to be a little bit different here and there but this one it was 399 right in the middle so we're gonna go with that now I use foam for all my shirts I have a couple different sizes I have a whole stack of them I just cut them with scissors I got this on Amazon I think I've heard Joanne's I mean really any craft store should have some foam but the foam gives it a nice soft backing so that you can get even pressure without having to do super high pressure and it helps allow for seams and stuff like that now even with paper underneath I have I've stained all of them just the ink that bleeds through some some things are worse than others this is from black sequin pillow and I had a sheet of butcher paper underneath and it still did that so now I always make sure that I kind of press it for a little bit to try to get as much ink off of it as I can and then I always put paper underneath if for no other reason than to protect what you're pressing so for this this little foam pad is big enough to cover the whole design so I'm going to use the smaller one because then I can leave the the seems to be off of the pad and then the shirt doesn't get quite so smashed sometimes you can see the back part of the tank top pressed into the front part of the tank top and so the smaller one works better but I just wanted to show you I have a full-size one sequined pillows I do on this this full one regular pillowcases waffle weave towels pretty much everything else goes on this bigger one and I never adjust the pressure on this press and they never changed the temperature I have another heat press that is a swing-away it's a lot easier to tweak the pressure on it this one is just a little bit I mean I had to add washers to the front part so that it would allow room and still be level with a foam pad so long story short I would recommend getting a nice he press but this works it's a sixteen by twenty four and I wanted the biggest one that I can afford and this is what it was but anyway so I'm going to take this one off it never press without this because this is pretty much those presses all just I use fabrics and so I always use with the foam pads so what you want to do first is get some butcher paper to go on the bottom I'm sorry you've seen my back but this is a big giant roll but your paper that I got from Sam's Club it's like I think I was like twenty bucks a piece that's big enough to cover the whole bottom platen and you can reuse this I got ink on the last one so I threw it away but I'm gonna pull this forward a little bit just so the top tank top strap can drop back there past the phone and put the phone down cover the top to protect the shirt itself so I have to then weigh the very first thing I do is I pre-press the shirt it gets out any initial moisture so I'm gonna take the tank top try not to burn your knuckles I really do like my swing away if you can afford a really big spoon or I get a swing away but this works so I'm just pushing this down so my seams I know you can't see this but right here is the edge of the foam so these seams from the tank top or not above it so they're not going to get smashed by the press nobody take butcher paper I put it over it and they just press it for a second whoa not a second but a few seconds then I pull it out and set it aside and I spray spray adhesive on the transfer now if there's I'm a little bit of a learning curve with this so I'm gonna show you how to do it this is my super high tech adhesive spring box I just use it over and over again I put it like this on the bottom and so what I'm not using it I just fold it back up and tuck at the bar get my kids labeled it sticky box so anyway put the transfer inside the box and this is the spray adhesive that I have found it works the best please for me I know that Conde sells a spray but their shipping was outrageous this was like 20 bucks at Michaels but you can use to 40% off coupon code so it makes it a little bit more reasonable but the trick is one use the box then you could be a little bit more flowy with it not worry about making a mess not to be as careful but there's a little black mark on the lid make sure it's aimed that way and it will get gummy after every time you use it so I take an alcohol swab which I keep a bunch of them on my windowsill here and clean that tip so that it sprays a nice fine mist if you don't clean that tip you don't have it aimed right it'll start to kind of drip and those drips will wreck your transfer so you can actually see it and know before you press it if you wrecked it and I've done it and I didn't clean it because there was only ten minutes since I sprayed the last one and it messed up so I am clean the tip I have the transfer inside the box I usually will shake it up I usually do a little test spray just on the side to make sure I'm getting a nice good mist and then you just kind of make a cloud inside see you could see the fog I probably should have the window open but the kids are outside playing being loud and so it's like a hundred degrees in here but that's all I do for spring so you pull it out and look at it if there's drips on the design those drips will show up when you press it so look at it and make sure that everything looks like it's got a nice fine mist before you waste a shirt cuz it happens I've done it just something to keep in mind so I'm moving the sticky box and not sure how well you can see this here okay so we're going back to the shirt so we pre pressed it it's sitting here looking all pretty quick thing about sizing I have yet to find some cheat sheet size chart that just tells you what size to make the transfer I measure every single one and just kind of get an idea so I thermometer over here I look at thermometer ruler I look at my ruler I might do this 11 inches I've already done this for I'm showing you I lay down on the shirt and I see where 11 inches would hit and no it's you know probably five inches tall and just kind of eyeball it and that's how I decide what size to make it but then I save it so I don't have to think that through every time I do a shirt so um there's a hair anyway so take your nice sticky adhesive transfer and I'm so I'm I'm big on eyeballing if you want to fold the shirt in half to get like a center line and put a careful crease whatever rulers t-squares there's all kinds of tricks but I just eyeball it and another reason why it's kind of nice to keep the extra edges on there's less gap on the side so it's a little bit easier to line up but I usually go a couple inches down from the neck of the shirt and I look up here these corners so it looks even and then I look at it from top to bottom okay I really don't like picking that up once I put it down but the shirts actually going to my sister-in-law and I don't want to mess it up so okay that looks good too so here's here's the really important parts that'll keep you from messing up a shirt you got to put paper inside the shirt on top of the shirt and under the shirt because it could depending on the design the ink can bleed through the shirt onto the back and I actually like to try to save these big pieces so I put paper underneath it as well so the paint doesn't give on this big sheet I have a stack of legal paper and regular letter size copy paper and that's what I use oh we're gonna cuz it's cheap and it's easy and I don't have to cut it so I take my legal paper and I put one on the press where the design is going to be I've kind of move it around as I need to I put one inside the shirt so this is another reason why I really like the spray adhesive is it'll stay put while you kind of mess around with it and you can line it up on the table and move it to the press when you're done it just it stays where you needed to there is adhesive tape high heat tape but I this big press creates like a suction every time I open it and even with the tape I couldn't get it to not move a little bit and once I got the spray adhesive down I'm sold okay so I can actually feel the paper through the shirt and we can pick it up and sometimes see it a little bit better but you just want to make sure that the paper is covering up so you don't send it through to the back cuz I've done that and then I get it as flat as I can and I grab you could feel the paper on the inside and the paper on top I just grab both and I pick it up and they move it over here to the press which I hate this part constantly fumbling the only for that foam again trying to get this stuff not getting smushed but make sure that the foam is underneath your whole design because otherwise it won't press you need to have good good contact okay then legal paper over the top so it saves this big giant piece of paper I just don't want to waste any more paper than have to cover the whole thing now remember 400 degrees 60 seconds but depending on your shirt you might want to you know you might have to adjust that a little bit but I've done the shirt I did this exact one yesterday so I know that this works so cover the whole thing the paper just kind of helps protect the shirt a little bit if you have a really shiny polyester shirt you could put two or three sheets of butcher paper on there it can help it a little bit but this press has a timer built in on it you just close it and starts counting but one last thing before I put it down I have a lint roller handy and you'll see why okay so now we're going to press it okay lift it slowly because it's it's gonna want to try to suck your paper up and make a big mess pull off and don't panic here you're not in a hurry do this carefully it's okay if it sits on here for a second even if you wanted to let it cool you don't have to like being a panic to rip it off so I'm gonna pull this off recycle bin the recycle bin gets filled up like every day okay so peeling this is important now I know we have spray adhesive but if for some reason you don't get enough on there or whatever it can still shift so just be careful in every step of the way when doing shirts I put my hand now it's hot but it's not - I actually my fingernails I can use my fingernail so I don't burn my fingers but I hold it a little bit in place while I grabbed the corner with my finger and then I peel it it just makes sure it doesn't shift while you're doing it um right when you get it out and pull it off I pull the paper out now I should have done this faster but again this is a really forgiving shirt some shirts are not as forgiving but while it's hot lint roller the crap out of it so this one like I said I've got the pressure down really good in this shirt stupid boy this shirt is is really forgiving that's why I like doing these ones so much but white especially it just seems to be harder but if you lit roller it really well and I'll do a video on towels that's where you see the biggest difference of towels but it helps lift up those fibers while it's hot so that they're not so melted down and then shake it out really good and that helps to but really this shirt this one is so easy this is a thread fast Apparel blizzard tank this is silver and down here is white blizzard they're my favorite super easy to do but anyway Oh turn this press off that's it and look at how good those colors look so I've done tests on all the the paper settings and stuff and the premium presentation Matt rocks now of the Kosmos ink rocks - so that helps I used to use a different brand and I won't name it because there's some people who love it but the blacks were kind of blue and the colors were just kind of randomly off some would be awesome and some wouldn't be so awesome so anyway um that's it beginning to end on how to sublimate a t-shirt just don't rush through it and practice but there's just a lot of little steps and I've I've wrecked all of them missed paper underneath missed part of the platen and so the design was cut off that's why I went for a really big press because it makes life easier in that aspect but but that's it and it's right than the fibers of the shirt it's smooth you know it just works awesome this was actually an SVG file and I went through and made some versions with buffalo plaid and I got like a grunge one or something and I can get links to all of those feel free to ask I can get you links for the tank tops the paper the ink any of it so let me know if you have any questions and hopefully you this helps some of you thanks [Music] you", "CHzLckkSATI": "Welcome back to the Gentleman's Gazette!\nIn today's video, we're going to be discussing a set of techniques that are\nabsolutely vital for keeping your clothes in wearable condition as long as\npossible, how to remove any type of stain you might encounter. This video is part\nof a series on garment care; the previous installments in the series dealt with\nhow to remove the musty smell from vintage clothing how to wash and\nmaintain wool sweaters and some cheap and easy laundry hacks, you can find\nthose videos by clicking the banners at the right. Today's video is the final\npart in this series and as we mentioned at the top, it covers stain removal. No\nmatter how careful a man may be in his day-to-day life with his clothes, the\noccasional stain is inevitable whether it be from a plate of spaghetti and\nimpromptu tire change on the side of the road or really any time spent with a\ntoddler, you're bound to encounter a tough stain at some point. Fortunately,\nhowever, stain removal doesn't have to be a chore or involve the dry cleaner. As\nlong as you understand some basic chemistry you'll be all set. To begin,\nhere's a breakdown of the four basic types of stains you're generally going\nto encounter. Stains can be organic or inorganic in nature and from there can\nbe oily or not. In other words, the four types of stains are organic, inorganic,\noily organic, and oily inorganic. As examples of each of these, stains from\nliving organisms including plants are considered organic, things like grass\nstains, blood, or red wine. Meanwhile, stains from manmade materials are\ninorganic, things like ink, solvents, or machine dust. Oily organics are things\nlike barbecue sauce or sweat stains and oily inorganics are generally cosmetics\nlike lipstick. With that said, there are a few exceptions as far as treatment is\nconcerned. Coffee and tea are treated like inorganics, for example. For such\nexceptions and really for any case, it never hurts\nto do a little bit of searching on the web but in general, here are the best\ntechniques we've found for getting rid of all of these different types of\nstains. First, standard organic stains are best treated with hot water and a\nsubstance that's commonly marketed as bleach alternative. Bleach alternative\nand oxygen bleach are marketing names for a substance that's scientifically\nknown as sodium percarbonate or SPC for short. It's the active ingredient in\ncleaners like Oxiclean but whereas those types of commercial cleaners\nusually contain fillers, SPC is most effective in its pure form. Here's a\nrelated point as long as we're talking about bleach alternative, never use\nconventional chlorine bleach on your clothes again. Not for stains and not for\nwhitening. Most white clothes are actually treated with agents referred to\nas optical whiteners or optical brighteners. Chlorine bleach, in addition\nto being harmful to the body if ingested or with prolonged contact, can also\nremove these optical whiteners from clothing actually making them look less\nwhite and can damage the fibers of clothes over time. So bleach alternative\nor SPC as we'll refer to it throughout the rest of the video is the way to go.\nFor treatment of an organic stain, start by laying a towel down on your work\nsurface. Actually, for any of the types of stains we're about to cover, putting down\na clean towel is a good idea. Next, add a bit of SPC, we used about 1/2 capful to a\nbasin of hot water and stir to completely dissolve it. Then, thoroughly\nwet the stained area of the garment in question with the hot water and SPC\nmixture. Lay the garment flat on the towel and gently blot at the stain with\na clean cotton cloth, wash cloth, or towel. You can also use a garment safe stain\nbrush on most fabrics as we're doing here. The exceptions to this being wool\nand silk, because these fabrics are often more delicate, we'll cover them\nseparately later on in the video. After pre\ntreating your stain this way, it can be washed as normal in your machine and if\nyou'd like, you can also add a bit more SPC directly to the drum of the machine\nduring the wash process. Next, standard inorganic stains like ink are best\nremoved by the use of a solvent. Rubbing alcohol or more technically isopropyl\nalcohol is best here. Although you can also use different substances like plain\nvodka. Applying the alcohol to the stain with a spray bottle works well after\nwhich point it can be gently blotted. Then wash as normal and as before, you\ncan add some SPC to the machine if you'd like. All oily stains whether they're\norganic or inorganic in nature are best treated by first dealing with the oil. As\noils often surround other staining substances, we'll be looking at these\nstains sort of like a stain sandwich that is oil layer, stain layer, oil layer.\nTo remove the first oil layer, fill a spray bottle with a solution of 50\npercent white vinegar and 50 percent water. Spray the oil layer of the stain\nand then blot. Actually, using a stain brush may work best here. Next, apply a\nbit of water along with laundry detergent or better yet soap flakes and\nscrub again to deal with the main stain layer and for the final oil layer, spray\nagain with your water and vinegar solution and blot or scrub a final time.\nTo finish here, you guessed it! Wash as normal with optional SPC. Finally, in this\nsection, we're going to pay special attention to sweat stains as they're\noften a combination of oily organics and the aluminum found in many commercial\nantiperspirants. They're best treated with a combination of SPC and a stain\nsolution. Apply a few drops of the stain solution to the sweat stain then add a\npinch of SPC, you should create a paste with either your finger or your stain\nbrush. Let this paste sit for at least 20 minutes or longer if you prefer and then\nrinse it out with hot water. In fact, boiling water poured\nfrom a teakettle works best here then wash as normal with optional SPC. Here's\na related tip to prevent stains from returning to these garments, you can\nspray the affected areas with your vinegar and water solution before\nwashing them as normal in your machine. So what about treating stains on wool\nand silk garments? As we said earlier, these types of garments are usually more\ndelicate in nature so you won't want to apply SPC to them directly or scrub them\nwith a stain brush. For these fabrics, it's best to pre-soak for a little while\nin water with a bit of stain solution and then wash as normal. Of course, these\ngarments, if placed in a washing machine, should be individually and tightly\npacked in mesh washing bags. You can add a bit of SPC to the drum of the machine\nwhile washing if you'd like since the low concentration and minimal direct\ncontact won't be overly abrasive. For more information on washing silk wool\nand other delicate fabrics, you can take some tips from our previous video on\nwashing sweaters here. Here are a few final tips for today.\nWhichever stain type and consequential removal method you're dealing with, know\nthat you shouldn't expect to see a complete clearing up of the stain as\nyou're scrubbing it. Rather aim for about an 80% reduction in stain visibility and\nthen machine wash, the rest should come out. As we said in our sweater video,\nwashing on warm and with the express setting should be sufficient for most\ngarments and you can always add a little bit of SPC to the drum if you so choose.\nFinally, it may well be that a given stain isn't solely one type of the\nstains we've covered here today. Therefore, if you've tried one removal\nmethod and the stain hasn't completely come out, just try one or more of the\nother removal methods and you should ultimately be successful. As an example\nof having to use multiple methods, we found both the fountain pen ink and the\nlipstick that we used for demonstration purposes in\nthis video to be especially resilient. They didn't come out with each of the\nfirst methods we recommended so we used a few other methods to get them out. We\nthink that they got to about the 80% stain removal threshold we were looking\nfor and putting them through the washing machine should get the rest of the\nstains out. With these techniques in your arsenal then, stains should no longer\npose a significant threat to you or your garments and you should be able to take\ncare of them completely from the comfort of your own home. As we said at the start\nof the video, be sure to take a look at the three previous installments in this\nlaundry and garment care series here. Which of the techniques we laid out\ntoday were you most surprised by and do you have any alternative techniques for\nstain removal that we didn't mention here?

informal given\nits two front pockets I'm wearing it over a shirt from Charles Charles Tyrwhitt that\nfeatures a gingham pattern in blue and white the shirt does have French cuffs\nbut I'm wearing them configured in a barrel style today so that they fit\nbetter under the sleeves of the sweater my cufflinks are vintage silver ones and\nthey feature a simple geometric pattern that complements the gingham pattern of\nmy shirt well my plain brown trousers harmonized\nwell with my shirt and cardigan and on that note you can check out our video on\nhow to effectively pair brown and blue here to go along with this color scheme\nmy socks are plain blue in color but they do feature a subtle stripe in their\nweave the outfit today is rounded out by my dark oxblood penny loafers which are\ninformal in nature and also harmonize well color wise I'm not really wearing\nvery many accessories today aside from the vintage cufflinks but if you'd like\nto take a look at some other types of

to another episode of fit design TV so happy to have you here on today's episode we'll be looking at cotton and polyester through the lens of a sportswear designer if you guys are wondering which of the two fiber types is most suitable for a sports or collection watch this video you're gonna find out [Music] welcome to fit design TV on this channel we'll explore what it takes to make it as an active wear fashion brand whilst providing tips tricks and actionable steps towards starting your own product line whether an entrepreneur look at the start your own brand or just someone interested in fitness fashion there's something for you here [Applause] [Music] cotton/polyester are often compared to contrasted just because they're so widely available on the market they're pretty much two of the most popular farmer types when making a selection on what fabrics to make there's a good reason for this and we'll go through it in this video the main difference that you need to know about these two fiber types is that cotton is a natural fiber versus polyester is a man-made or a synthetic fiber that we made in labs and those are pretty much the main core reasons as to what drives their differences we're looking at six different categories in terms of determining which of the two fiber types is most suitable for a sportswear application hopefully by the end you'll be able to make an educated decision on what is right for you we'll be looking at the durability of these two fiber types the temperature regulation of these two fiber types we'll also be looking at the comfort and feel of these two fiber types the ease of maintenance or cleaning the cost associated and last but not least the light weight this of these two fiber types we'll start off with number one the durability the durability has a lot to do with that cotton is naturally occurring and polyester is a synthetic fiber cotton will wear out over time a lot more easily than polyester while you'll notice with a new cotton t-shirt is it's good at retaining its shape up until a few washes at which point it begins to break down from a fiber standpoint it gets a lot more loose it starts to hang loosely it gets a lot softer and this is because it's just much more of a delicate fiber versus polyester which is polymer based it's synthetic fiber it's just going to have a lot more strength into your ability over time it's going to be able to withstand a lot more wear and tear which is important when it comes to sportswear design we're always active we're moving around we're putting our garments through a great ordeal of dynamic activity and our garments need to be able to match our need when it comes to stretch or movement or agility and if cotton is going to wear out over time you're going to notice your garment get looser it's not going to fit as well and it's just overall not gonna perform as well as it needs to perform versus polyester it's gonna go through a lot more wear and tear before it exhibits similar levels of deterioration polyester wins here next is temperature regulation if you know anything about the way that our bodies regulate temperature you know that we spell sweat through the surface of our skin and through the process of evaporation we move away heat from our bodies cotton is breathable which is a win for it in that regard however it absorbs moisture it doesn't wake moisture away from its surface puts it on the skin so what that ends up doing is it prevents the body from allowing sweat to evaporate away from the skin thereby allowing you to feel hotter which polyester doesn't do polyester is more thermal constricting up until a certain point so it'll make you feel hotter and a certain range of temperatures but it will allow you to quick sweat away to the surface of your skin which will allow it to evaporate it won't hold on to that moisture and it won't give you that hot look that cotton is going to do because cotton is just gonna want to absorb all this sweat or first is polyester which is going to wick that sweat away so coffin is much more suitable for neutral climates polyester on the other hand is going to be the more suitable for hot climates where you're going to want to sweat or cooler climates where you're going to want to constrain or restrict the movement of heat away from your body so if you want to look at it cotton is in the middle neutral and then plaster on either sides of the climate scale next we'll look at the comfort and feel comfort of your is a major reason why we select certain fabric and it's no different in this case polyester is known to be a bit more let's just say allergenic when it comes to the way it reacts with people's bodies yes it's silky and it's smooth but it does cause some irritation on a decent segment of the population there are many people that may overcome a certain level of irritation or just an overall mild discomfort with polyester based fabrics that they won't with the cotton content being durable sorry cotton being breathable and cotton being natural it just lends itself to being a lot more suitable for a wider range of skin types so cotton is going to get the edge in this regard cotton is just a generally more forgiving fabric when it comes to skin types and how it meshes with our bodies we also want to look at the ease of maintenance or cleaning like I mentioned cotton is just less durable so it's going to withstand less wear and tear that is afforded by washing whether it's a washing machine or your washing by hand you're going to wear out cotton and faster than polyester polyester though is more prone to deterioration from heat from high levels of heat because it's a polymer based compound it's going to be a lot more sensitive to heat which is also why you can't iron it nor should you iron it but the plus here is that you don't need to iron it whereas caught in wrinkles very easily needs constant care and attention to iron it polyester on the other hand doesn't you just have to be careful not to iron it because you will ruin the garment and not the subject the high levels of heat in a washing machine so it's a give and take here but generally polyesters is going to be easier to maintain over time we want to look at the cost cost is a complicated subject because there are a wide range of different qualities of polyester and cotton but if we're going to be very objective and comparing one to one generally cause it is more expensive than polyester because cotton is a naturally occurring fiber it's limited in our supply - what is available in terms of the agricultural landscape what is the local market able to offer us in terms of raw supply of cotton plant in order to create our cotton fiber needs versus polyester which is a polymer based compound we are able to make it a lot more freely and on our own terms so polyester is going to be cheaper in this regard however you can get better quality of polyester and at the same time you can get a better quality of cotton so it depends it is a give-and-take but I want to one buy a service gonna be cheaper the last is the lightweight nature of both garments hello cotton is more breathable on a meter per meter basis where both fabrics have the same thickness you're going to notice that polyester is going to be significant more lightweight again it is because of the fact that this is a synthetic fiber we're able we were able to create it and as lightweight a case as we can polyester generally is much more lightweight than cotton so for sure if you're going for a lightweight fabric and you want to have some thickness to it you want to go with polyester versus cotton that being said both fabric types or fiber types do have their applications in different cases but we generally do recommend polyester when looking at a core fiber type to incorporate your collection coffin is great for a certain level of tops or lightweight garments that you want to have in a situation where you want to have a natural fiber of your collection but for more of your heavy duty core essential garment types you want to look at polyester because it's going to perform in a way that is a lot more analogous with the needs of sportswear design hopefully guys that makes sense we've also done a video on polyester versus nylon because those are both synthetic fibers that often get compared we give you our verdict on that one highly recommend you check it out if you want us to compare and contrast any other fiber types leave it in the comments below we always love making these videos for you guys if we missed on anything again in the comments below thank you so much for tuning in to fit design TV until next time sails", "zrdg_HoXxAA": "what's up everyone in today's video i'm gonna give you my top five t-shirt blanks for printing your vintage designs we're gonna rank each t-shirt on how it fits the wash and overall feel plus i'll let you know how much you can expect to pay for each option let's go [Music] what's up everyone so first of all thank you to all the new subscribers that are here thank you to everyone who's been subscribed the last three or four weeks have been pretty amazing in terms of how this channel has grown and how my instagram page has grown um so i only have you guys to thank for that so thank you very much so in today's video i'm going to answer the number one question that i get now if you've watched my top 10 faq video this was deliberately left out because i didn't have a good answer at the time this required me to do some research and like really source material for this video so the question we're gonna answer in today's video is what is the best t-shirt blank for printing vintage designs a lot of the tutorials on my channel are based on you know bootleg style designs vintage graphics that sort of thing so this is obviously a question that has come up a ton and i wanted to make sure i had the right answer for you guys um a few of you had already dm me and i tried to give some advice and i was pretty much correct on the advice that i gave but this basically solidified that for me what we're gonna do today is essentially rank each t-shirt in terms of its overall fit and its overall wash and feel then we're going to look at how much it's going to cost you per t-shirt blank so without further delay let's get into this list so the first t-shirt that we have is the next level inspired dye t-shirt this color is called shadow so a few things about next level um they definitely have some more like contemporary sort of fashion forward garment styles so if you're looking for garments that are a little bit more unique not just like standard t-shirts and hoodies and long sleeves the next level inspired dye t-shirt is not made in the usa um it's probably safe to say that none of the next level products are made in the us so that's something that's important to you you'll want to look elsewhere so let's get into the fit of this t-shirt first um i generally like my t-shirts a little bit more baggy especially my vintage tees so for me this is like a two out of five it's pretty tight the length is also fairly short um the sleeves are short and they're pretty tight so that's why i'm giving this a two out of five i personally like a neckline that's a little bit tighter but this was so tight that it was like hard for me to take off like i had to like struggle to get it over my head so that's probably not a good thing the wash and feel of this is probably a 4 out of 5. it has a nice fade to it it's relatively lightweight so if you don't mind you know t-shirts fitting a little bit tighter this would be a pretty good option the color on this uh definitely looks vintage to me i've gotten plenty of shirts that are true vintage t-shirts that are like this exact color so um that's great the price on this is about in the middle of the spectrum leaning a little bit more towards the more expensive side it's about six dollars per t-shirt one thing you really have to keep in mind when sourcing blanks is that you get what you pay for so if you don't have the biggest budget um you know it's going to be really tough to get super high quality t-shirt blanks that being said you know there's nothing wrong with starting at the low end of the spectrum saving a little bit more money so you can invest later you know as the brand grows and then maybe you know you'd get better blanks or you outsource for custom blanks um but this is a pretty decent starting point there's also this random green shirt in the box that sns activewear sent me so uh shout out to them for the free uh green shirt that i'll never wear so next on the list we have the comfort wash by hanes t-shirt this is um new railroad gray this was the closest thing that i could see to you know anything that sort of had a vintage look to it um yeah i mean we all know that haynes is sort of a brand that is not necessarily known for the highest quality products you know they've been around forever they're you know probably what you go to if you're like at target or walmart you need like a quick five you know blank t-shirts you maybe get a pack of hanes shirts um so this is going to fall on the lower end of the spectrum in terms of quality and price that being said since this is part of the comfort wash series um it's definitely a higher quality t-shirt than your standard hanes blank so this particular t-shirt the comfort wash by hanes is also not made in the usa so again look elsewhere if that's something that's really important to you the fit on this one is definitely better than the next level option but it's still on the tighter side i found that the length was good but again the sleeves and just the overall fit was just like too tight for my taste the wash and feel of this one is decent i'm giving it a three out of five as well um it's more so for the feel and less for the wash i don't love this new railroad gray color it sort of has like almost a purplish tint to it so yeah personally i'm not really into that this t-shirt would be a good option if you were just starting out because price wise it is on the lower end of the spectrum this is around 450 to 5.00 per t-shirt so if you're looking for a budget-friendly option that still sort of has you know an overall look and feel of a vintage t-shirt this would be a good bet so moving on to the next t-shirt we have what i would consider the best option in terms of a t-shirt actually looking like it could be vintage this is the alternative apparel um distressed heritage tea this color is smoke gray and then i also got um dark pigment blue this looked a little bit darker on the website so i don't think i would print on this necessarily but i just picked it up because i have seen um plenty of vintage t-shirts that had sort of like a blue tint to it so i just thought i would try it out but the um smoke grey option is good like it has a nice fade to it it's um you know obviously leaning more towards pure black as opposed to gray the overall fit of this t-shirt i'm giving a three out of five it's decent it's a little bit snug but the length is good um the sleeves are good they're not too tight the best thing about this t-shirt as i already mentioned is that it does have a look and feel of a true vintage t-shirt um i don't know if this will show up but there is distressing on the collar there's also distressing on the sleeves and then at the bottom on the hem here there's um distressing as well so it's very light distressing it's not um overly done so you know it's not gonna like tear or anything like that um but it just adds a nice touch and gives us a overall solid vintage feel the alternative apparel distressed heritage t-shirt is super lightweight and it's not paper thin but it is definitely the thinnest t-shirt out of any sample that i got so if that's something that's important to you guys um definitely consider this one the other cool thing about this shirt is that it's single stitched so if you know anything about vintage t-shirts um you know anything from the 80s or you know the early to mid 90s maybe even the late 90s is going to be single stitched that is extremely hard to find from wholesalers in terms of blanks so you know if that's important to you this would be a great option now the issue with this t-shirt is you know i've mentioned all the things like the distressing and the single stitching now that comes with the price so this is going to cost you about ten dollars per t-shirt which is obviously at the other end of the spectrum in terms of your budget like you really need to save up if you're going to use this blank next on deck we have the bella canvas fast fashion heavyweight street tea bella is a company that is very uh conscious of trends and this is uh this is dark gray by the way um but they're very conscious of trends i remember when like the drop tale t-shirts were super hot like 2013 14 something like that and they were one of the first wholesale companies that i saw who offered them and i think maybe american apparel did as well at the time but uh yeah they're pretty uh fashion forward and um they are made in the usa so i think that's um a big reason why they're popular at least here in the states i probably use bella canvas more than any other company in terms of um you know designing for artists and bands so let's talk a bit about the fit of this t-shirt um i'm giving it a five out of five because it is a boxy style t-shirt and it's fully committed um some of the other t-shirts kind of played with the idea it felt like of being like a boxy style shirt but this one fully commits to it the sleeves are loose the neckline is good it's you know shorter than your standard t-shirt but it fits looser so yeah i have to give this a 5 out of 5. i'm probably just going to wear this blank in terms of the overall wash and feel i'm going to give this a 3 out of 5 only because this is all about printing vintage designs and if i saw a design printed on this shirt i wouldn't think that it was vintage whatsoever um i would i'm almost leaning more towards i'd give it like a two and a half if i get i was doing half but i'm just giving it a 3. like it has a good feel to it like it has a nice weight um it's it's on up the lighter side of heavyweight if that makes sense like it's it is lighter than the other heavyweight shirts that i got um but yeah i would give this a a three out of five one thing i will say about this t-shirt is that it's very well constructed it's super high quality i think you can say that about most of bella's products um so if you're looking for something that isn't necessarily meant to look vintage you're more concerned about the fit and having that sort of boxy style look to it this is going to be a really great option for you price wise we're pretty good like this is around five dollars and fifty cents to six dollars per shirt so overall considering the quality of this garment and um you know the style of it i think that's pretty decent so if that's sort of the vibe you're going for um yeah i would highly consider this option the final t-shirt blank on this list is my personal favorite it is the comfort colors garment dyed heavyweight t-shirt and this color is pepper so i don't know if you can see this but there's a small like lighter area here that's because i like this shirt so much that i wore it a couple times and i already stained it i'm not like a super grubby guy i just spilled some  on it so whatever but that just goes to show you how much i like this t-shirt so i feel like comfort colors has sort of made a name for themselves because of their pigment dyed garments um you know they have hoodies long sleeves unisex t-shirts women's t-shirts and they all have this pigment dot process essentially pigment dyed means that the colors are washed down so that they will age and soften over time so that really lends itself to the overall vintage uh feel and look of these t-shirts another cool thing about comfort colors is they offer a variety of colors so along with this pepper uh shade i got graphite as well and this sort of has um more of a purple tint like i was mentioning earlier and then i just got black just because i was hoping that it would be a little bit more faded uh than this but it's pretty much just true black um that being said this is my favorite um for a few reasons the overall fit in my opinion is a five out of five um this fits almost like a like a 90s bronchum t-shirt if anyone's familiar with that um they're like one of the most iconic vintage uh t-shirt brands from the 80s and 90s and this sort of has that like loose like boxy esque feel the sleeves are on the looser side of things so for me like that's pretty clutch this is honestly close to like a contemporary brand like yeezy or like fear of god where like if you wear a xl t-shirt normally like i have to buy large and yeezy or fear of god because they're an oversized fit so this is sort of on par with that the wash and feel of this one i'm gonna give a four out of five um i would give it a 5 out of 5 but i'm comparing it to that alternative apparel example which you know had the distressing throughout and it was a little bit more thin you know to the touch so it had more of a vintage feel but this one is still really really solid again this is just my personal preference for what i'm looking for in vintage t-shirts um anything that i buy i like to be a little bit looser feeling i don't like  that's super tight on me so um yeah this is gonna be my go-to if and when i do a brand you will know that they are comfort color blanks finally the price on this one is pretty good it's five bucks a t-shirt so it's kind of right in the middle of the spectrum so i mean overall man like between how it fits and the feel and wash and the price this would be my go-to so that is it for today hopefully i was able to answer this question that so many of you guys had um i did give suggestions to a few of you prior to making this video and um if you look at my message it was pretty much right on i i suggested comfort colors and bella so you know that's what kind of came up on top today if you like this video be sure to hit that like button i would really appreciate it and definitely comment below if you have any questions about the blanks that i went through in this video if there's anything you want to see in future videos anything that you want me

It's courage, it's bravery,\nin a few short minutes I will be wearing 100\nt-shirts, not because I'm lucky, but because I'm\ncapable of doing things that other people can barely\nbring themselves to speak of. - Chill out dude, it's\njust an internet challenge. - Correction, it's an\ninternet challenge I can win! It's been quite some time\nsince I won a challenge, and today I turn things around! - Well of course you're not\ngonna lose this challenge, you're not competing against anyone. - So we agree! - I pay you! - Hey! I got an idea. Let's start putting shirts on Grapefruit. - Love it. - Great! Here we go. - Without me it's just\n'aweso.' Hehehe, I like it. Mainly cause it's so true. - Well, if you like that one, you're gonna love what's in store. We raided a novelty t-shirt place. - Wait, you're telling me\nthat all 100 of the shirts I'm about to put on are novelty t-shirts? - Relax, Grapefruit. Frankie says so. (Apple and Pear laugh) - Ugh. Well, it is quite\nslimming. Ain't so bad. - Glad to hear it. I knew we'd\nmake a Beleiber out of you. (Apple laughs) - I'm not guys! I'm not! Not a Belieber! - Uh, protesting pretty hard there, dude. - I can't have people see\nme in a shirt like this! I got an image to maintain! - Dude, who cares? No one's gonna see it. We're about to put 96\nshirts over the top of it. - I suppose you're right.\nReally, the only shirt that matters is the final shirt. - Exactly. That's the\none you'll be wearing when I take the photo for the newspaper. - Oh, nice! I've always\nwanted to be in the newspaper. _ Well then we gotta keep going! We have to get the photo turned in before they run the presses. - In that case, proceed. Bring\non the next novelty t-shirt! - (laughs) I also like\nthis cause it's true. (laughs) Even better! I gotta say, you guys really outdid yourselves. These shirts are really funny and--hey! What the heck is this? - They were on clearance!\nThey had a bunch of 'em. - Well I don't like it! - Why not? You liked 'em\nwhen they pointed at us. - Well yeah, because they were true when they pointed at you guys. Don't you guys see how wrong it is to have a shirt pointing at me, calling me stupid like this? Doesn't it gnaw at you?\nAren't you overcome with an overpowering sense of dread, that a grave injustice has been committed? - No. - Not really. - Just me, huh? Well then, I\nsuppose this just goes to show what an empath I am. You got any shirts like\nthat in there, little Apple? Shirts that say 'I'm with empath?' Or, 'I'm with a good person?' - No, but I got a shirt that says this! - (laughs) Now this is\nwhat I'm talkin' about. Back on track, fellas. Back on track. - Glad we avoided that clothes\ncall! (laughs) Here we go! (playful music) - Whew! Okay, we've\ncome to the final shirt. - How ya feelin, Grapefruit? - Very squeezed, very immobilized. - You wanna pick out the\nfinal shirt yourself? - While I'd love to, I\nliterally cannot move in any way, shape, or form. - Well that's fine, we'll\njust hold up some options and you tell us what you want. Okay? - Can't wait. - Okay, option one. - Pretty good. While it is a nice day, I'm not sure yellow is my color. This is a big decision you know. The final shirt is what I'll be wearing in the newspaper, remember. - All right, option two, then. Yes, that's the one! (laughs) This one is so me! I'm a classy guy, and this T shirt reflects that. I've made my decision. I\nwant to be immortalized in the newspaper wearing a tuxedo t-shirt. (laughs) So witty.\n(drumroll) - Okay then, here we go.\nT-shirt number 100, coming up. Uh oh. - What? What's that uh oh mean? - It's too small. - I'm not fat, you're fat! - No one's calling you fat,\ndude! You're wearing 99 shirts! - Oh, right. Sorry, had\na flashback to fat camp. Err- I mean nature camp. - So what do we do? We\ngotta get Grapefruit into a hundredth shirt, and quick! The newspaper goes to\nprint any moment now. - I'll go back to the store. - Okay, hurry! Get the biggest shirt they- Wow, you're back. Okay,\nI'm ready with the camera! - Here it goes! Say 'cheese!' - Chee--what the heck is this? - I'm sorry, it was the\nonly one they had in stock. - But--\n- No time! I gotta take this to the newspaper, STAT! - Hey! Hey, don't publish that! Printing a lie and slander! Or liable. I forget which one, but it's illegal. Ugh, can't move! Ugh. Could\nthis day get any worse? - Hey, what's with the shirt? You callin' me stupid? - No, sir. The arrow isn't pointing at-- - Don't you tell me where\nthe arrow's pointin', I can see where the arrow's pointin'. Cause I ain't stupid, now you gonna point that arrow somewhere else, or do we got a problem? - Sir, I regret to inform you\nthat I cannot point this arrow anywhere else. - Then we got a problem. And\nme, I deal with problems. - You're just eatin' birdseed,\nhow's that dealin' with me? - Oh, you'll see in about 20 minutes. - Couldn't even win this\none, could ya Grapefruit?

to talk to you about choosing the right t-shirt for your brand we're not going to necessarily talk at all we're going to speak on a couple that we're familiar with that we can recommend suppose what you rock in the comment we want to hear other ideas other shirts that are popular other materials and things you guys want to hear about or learn about cool so we've got a couple t-shirts here today we're going to run through them we're going to show you a couple the details and then we want to hear from you what are you working with what's your t-shirt oh let's do it around for stuff is the Gildan t-shirt this is definitely the most economical garment it's really like a heavier weight garment and it has like an a box ear cut to it very traditional kind of square cut t-shirt heavy collar and heavier material heavier in a coarser material tell us which that cotton one cool thing is it does have the tearaway label so if your real label in it you can easily rip that thing off and make it your own next up we have the Toltecs if that is widely known as the Gildan I would kind of think of it as a step up from the Gildan it's made in Mexico has a more fashion-forward that cut to it it's also a little bit softer this one is also 100% cotton the cut really reminds me of like an American Apparel t-shirt but since it's not made in the US it's a little bit cheaper price point is a little bit more than a guild in but less than the American that's it that's what pill Tech's all about I have an American Apparel 2001 in my hand this is the standard American Apparel t-shirt a great shirt it's got a nice thin collar super high quality cotton construction fitted for sure like American Pie was famous for their fit they're all about the fit solid standard a little bit higher price point you know it's not going to be the lowest of the low in America so if that matters to you you know spend a little bit more on it but it's going to be worth it in terms of quality this will hold up it's a good quality shirt next I have American Apparel 50/50 tee the BB 401 it's a great product good to know super soft at 5050 I love not going to shrink as much Records got 50% poly 50% percent cotton pretty much the same cut as the 2001 but because it doesn't have that shrinkage and because it's this material it feels like it sits on the body a little bit looser or whatever reasons it's like the vibe of this thing so it kind of has a little bit less of that rigidity that on a percent cotton has this is american apparel triblend which is a rayon polyester and cotton the TR 401 very popular shirts super soft really great texture to it you can see it's just like got this amazing speckle most of the colors have this kind of Heather which I love but in terms of printing if you're doing digital printing or even screen printing these aren't necessarily going to be as vibrant as a hundred percent cotton so most printing is really vibrant on cotton keep that in mind when you're going off the prints but as far as the fit of a shirt you want throw a pocket on this thing go and do your label on it this is a beautiful t-shirt really nice quality and definitely going to pay for it you know this is the Heather tee and the cost of it made in America just like getting American Apparel's and just like you paid for that crispy fit now really excited about Bella canvas we only have one shirt from them in this video but their product is on point they have incredible fabrics they have a factory here in LA they have other factories in Honduras and other parts of the world but they use solar panels to power the factory they pay their workers well they really pride themselves and kind of environmental and economic sustainability across the board so big fan of Bella canvas and we use them for their long tea see it's got that we've done a long team review to look out for that you can check out I'm able to link to long to you if you get a little info on that but this logs he's super fashion forward right obviously long it's cut lower in the back it's you know narrow more loose-fitting you know it's not like the tight-fitting American Apparel shirt but the scalloped back is really fresh 200 percent cotton so it's good for prints it's definitely higher on the price point made by a great company but you are going to pay for that so as you're building your brand you can kind of build brand equity with a product like this they're good so we hope that this gives you a little bit of the story shirt options for your brand what might make sense for you and just help you make

started with but i do love sublimation but anyway uh today we're gonna try another method of supplementing on a hundred percent carb cotton uh dark garment we're gonna try something called b flex sublimation flop i want to make sure i said it right because it's not b flex flop it's b flex sublimation flop it's made to sublimate on now full disclosure um i got it over there at the vinyl stand hit that link in the description if you want some boom but um full disclosure it came with no instructions my guy um i really can't find much on b flex flock sublimation but i'm just gonna use my judgment and we're going to get it done but i literally have no instruction um i would find it similar to easy subleave where you can print on it and print cutting all that or the way i like to do it is just lay the easy subway and this up on top of it because for some reason my easy sublease gets jammed in my printer i don't know it don't happen to everybody happy to me i ain't banging with it so if you see my previous video uh sublimating 100 cotton dark colors with easy sublease if you have it first pause it go watch that come back here and we're going to do the exact same process but with the flock yeah so go watch that run them numbers up and then come back over here because i need y'all i need you i need these subscribers anyway um let's get it rocking and rolling so that's what

want to show you what we're working with um so this is the b flex sublimation flop i mean don't look like none of y'all look like white piece of paper but y'all i feel like flop very smooth suede like material right so obviously that's the side you sub it on and then it's got this backing on it that hopefully i'll be able to just peel off and apply to my hoodie then once i attack that down i'm gonna go ahead and just the image is upside down this is what we putting on the hoodie wu-tang y'all know wu tang bruce lee kung fu i thought it was dope i want to put this on sean would do it yeah it

you guys that i was going to be trying to sublimate onto cotton and to the best of my knowledge to best of my limited amount of knowledge the only way you can sublimate onto constant cotton is if you have a easy subli setup with your sg500 easy sub ink package or if you buy some solution that is available on etsy and available on amazon amazon links down below for that solution also i'm an amazon affiliate helps channel out a lot when you use my amazon link anytime you shop and buy anything on amazon just a side note give this video a thumbs up again so um guys i went ahead and i purchased this solution from amazon right and this is what i got i got this right here in the mail this is what i got all right um and i'm gonna show you guys what it looks like on the amazon um uh the amazon page this exact thing that i got and this is what came in the mail okay yeah that's all i'm gonna say about that so needless to say it took me a little while to get to the point to make this video because i had to get a spray bottle because oh terrible does not have a spray bottle so i finally got my lazy butt together and i got a spray bottle from walmart and we're gonna pour some of this into here and we're gonna go on to vexels.com and pick out an easy design and print it out and see if we can submit it on a shirt using the solution on a cotton 100 cotton shirt and see how it comes out guys so let me say this again i'm also a vexel's affiliate for those of you guys who want to purchase a membership to a website that offers unlimited amounts of images that you can use to start your

jpegs pn they have everything on there just go check it out vexel's my um vexel's affiliate link is down description below also guys so let's uh get into this let's just start pouring this stuff and um see you know spray it onto shirt i know you got to let it dry for a little while actually i don't know anything because it just came like this with no instructions so let's just pour it in here all right let's get this started guys please excuse the ashy hands had to go over to the rental property and um change my my tenant had an issue with the hot water heater there was a um there was a hose disconnected hot water heater that um had a hole in it so squirting out water a little bit of water so i had to uh get a new hose from lowe's and replace that no problem easy fix oh look at this this fits perfectly nice i like it when it's perfect like that what's up dub nation hit that like button when you get a chance so guys now we are just going to go ahead with our pre-treatment of the shirt we have 100 percent poly what am i talking about we have a hundred percent cotton gildan shirt right here we're gonna pre-treat with this solution handy-dandy solution that we purchased um a good idea would probably be for you to get a lint roller and roll all this stuff off but i'm not going to do that we're just going to do it like as if uh a worst-case scenario type of thing to give you guys a full idea of what would happen just gonna try to get the hair off though so it's already shaked up we've shaken it up already good we're just gonna try to um oh we gotta put this on spray okay there's a single mist off and there's our misti mist with the three sprinkly lines things all right so we kind of want to spray it on evenly kind of sort of it's kind of weird a good thing would be is if you had a roller but we're just going to spray it on and latches i think that's should be enough i don't know and we're just going to let it dry all right i think we gotta let it dry i'm not sure because this thing came with no instructions came just like this so we're just gonna lay it over our sublimation printer to dry for a little while while we go to our next step guys for those of you guys that use this before let me know if i'm doing it right because i really don't know but um it didn't come with instructions so this is just like this video is just like if one of you guys would have got it in the mail and you guys are just going along trying to figure it out right common sense you have to get a spray bottle and spray it on so i think you got to let it dry that's common sense you wouldn't press something that's wet so let's move on to the next step if you're new to the channel and you haven't subscribed yet please hit the subscribe button i greatly appreciate it it helps me

real fast so pay attention okay the other day a company named ouidro contacted me on instagram and they actually sent me out a pair of their 300 dollar premium step rails for the 2020 jeep wrangler unlimited for those of you guys who have jeep wranglers and are interested in step rails like the ones that i got from ouidro then i'll put the link down below so you guys can my amazon affiliate link down below so you guys can purchase yourself some of these step rails it was a really really easy install to be honest with you guys if you know if you're a little bit savvy about um about tools and things like that you know how to work way around just nuts and bolts that's it it's just bolt-on easy no cuts had to be made or anything i did it myself in a parking lot the other day i'll also put the link right here as a matter of fact of the video of me installing the whole thing so you guys can check it out it's on the other channel subscribe to that channel by the way but um it was an easy easy process and i got to tell you guys i was i kind of did not want to change the um the the step rails but now that i've had them on for a little while i really really like the look of the aftermarket step rails and i'm glad that i went ahead and took them up on their offer and got those step rails installed on my 2020 jeep wrangler sport unlimited guys more upgrades to that truck is coming up is coming up because we have big plans for that truck i was supposed to do some stuff this summer but due to cover 19 everything just fell through and it's ruined our plans as far as you know the whole audio system with the microphone and everything those you guys don't know about that look in the channel um in the other channel and you guys will see all the upgrades and stuff that i did to the jeep and more upgrades to come like i said so guys this heat press right here this heat press right here you guys saw the review that i did on it and all the things that i didn't like about it and the more and more i use my godzilla press which we're not pressing on today we're using our regular craft press plus whatever the heck this is called that i really more and more dislike to be honest with you guys i do not recommend you guys um buy this i would much rather you buy a walleye press from heat transfer house which i should get one to demonstrate it for you guys matter of fact i will get one to demonstrate for you guys because why not um if i'm gonna tel um advise something that that's a worthy purchase for you guys i should have it in front of you guys to show you all right so stay tuned for that while i press coming up but they're always sold out they're really really good presses heat transfer house link down below anyway i'm always saying i feel like anyway guys um i really feel like the more i use the godzilla press with the auto open feature this 15 by 15 is even though it has a slide out drawer it's just not it anymore guys it's just not it anymore i'm going to suggest it if it's in your budget if it is in your budget and you um are in the market for uh your first heat press that you just go ahead and buy an auto open press or save your money just a little bit longer and go ahead and buy the johto on a heat transfer house that's that's a good auto open press solid build and i think that's what we're going to switch to guys i think i think this is going to go bye-bye and we're going to get the jodo press if we can get a 15 by 15 because they're always sold out too because they're extremely extremely good presses um so we'll see what happens all right let me let this thing finish heating up and we will do our test i'm excited are you excited you should be excited so while the heat press is heating up i went ahead and sat the shirt on to the platen because it's still a little bit damp and i think it's supposed to be dry i'm not sure but i'm just going to go ahead and hover a little bit hover shout out to the hover squad it's going to go ahead and hover and if that does anything um it should help it dry so yeah just hover a little bit and i'll be right back after it's heated up aida productions so now our shirt is dried bone dry to the max so now i'm going to go ahead and put in my one layer of butcher paper let me roll it up a little bit like i always do pardon the hand guys i should get you guys another angle but this will do i don't know what happened right here i got a little something right there on there on the shirt but it's okay because we're just doing a test put that butcher paper up in there up in here nice and flat all right grab my first llama all right slide this out because i don't want to start heating up all right now we're going to go ahead and put this llama on here like so boom good enough looking good feeling good line up sideways yeah it looks good all right put this at the top slide it in we're going to do a 60 second press on it 20 second 24 second mark guys and because i do what a lot of youtubers don't do of course we're going to waste a shirt i know it's going to come out crappy but we're going to put a one of the limas on a untreated shirt just so we can compare the two for those of you guys who have never seen what it looks like to sublimate onto 100 cotton untreated all right go ahead and let this thing up boom all right let's see what we got here okay didn't get caught that's good look at that he already it's kind of like stuck like sticky okay i'm actually i actually i hold on now guys let me do the other one first aida productions hannah i'm kind of uh surprised now kinda surprised kinda pleasantly pleased to be honest with you i am pleasantly pleased let me go ahead and roll this up i'm gonna get the other one ready just so you guys know that there is a difference between using that substance versus not using that substance all right so what i did was i sprayed it on there the downside to um having to spray it on yourself is that you're not you can't with a spray bottle get an even coat of of of that material on there so they do have something available that's like a kit keep on forgetting i got the slide out it has a kit where like you can spray it on and no roll it on and it rolls on evenly i know that's available on the market somewhere i've just never used it i think stan banks shouts out to stan banks have uh has i think he's used it in the video before but i don't have that available right now to me obviously so boom pre-press let's put on our second llama and we get you got to lay it on there because we pre tr press the shirt so it's already warm which means it's already going to activate the sublimation stuff lay this down on here slide it back 60 second press for this one aw productions some of you guys are going to purchase this stuff man i think some of you guys are going to purchase this stuff it's not that bad even though it didn't come the way it was advertised and feeling some type way about that but it's still you know we'll see 60 second press just to be fair i did leave the first press on a little bit longer so i'm going to leave this one on a little bit longer now we're going to bring it up all right and no sticky no sticky uh sound like the other one all right actually not bad either not bad either but let's compare the two guys let me get this heat press out the way so we can compare the two adap productions all right so let's talk about it let's talk about it let's talk about it you guys should immediately be able to see the difference in what's what 100 cotton non-treated cotton transfer still bright and vivid on the paper very very light on the shirt lightly transferred but nonetheless it did transfer personally i think that if you want to sublimate onto 100 cotton if the design calls for it i would think that if you want a vintage look and you guys would have to test this out and do it for yourself to see what i'm talking about i'm going to try to get some close-ups for you guys but i think it's very much worth still sublimating on 100 cotton non-treated that's what i'm going to say now whether it's going to wash off after one wash i don't know i would think that it maybe maybe not based off of the back i mean you could see that it did kind of go into the fibers but it's not as vivid as the treated shirt but if you want a vintage type of faded type of look which that might you know that might be a look that you want for a shirt i don't know but i think it's uh if you're going for that look that you could possibly still do this non-treated now let's go to the treated one and let's see uh the results and i'm gonna kind of have to give you guys a close-up of this because there's a lot going on with this all right so the first thing that's going on with this thing that i'll tell you guys i can see that even though it transferred better than the non-treated shirt i still have blotches blotches on the transfer where you could see like the spray that i sprayed on i guess that's why they make pre-treatment machines when doing dtg you know and even on the transfer you can see all the blotches from the uh from the chemical that we transferred onto the shirt and even when you touch the shirt versus the other shirt you can feel like almost feel like a stiff type of chemical on there right versus the one that was not pre-treated all right so um yeah still a lot on here not as much as this not as much as this one but still a lot all right there's still a lot of ink on here not as much as not as much as this one all right but if you ask me the faded look is a cleaner image it might be a lighter image it might be a faded type of effect of an image but it's still a cleaner image because it doesn't have these blotches in it so that's something to consider guys um but i don't know if you want to do this if you can think of a creative way to apply this stuff so it doesn't put these blotches on there which you guys are creative you can come up with something use a paint brush or something roll it on there so it's even i think that's what the system has it has a paint brush or something like that if you could use a paint not a paint brush but a paint roller and that will put an even coat on there you know maybe something that's not fuzzy or something like that something's cloth i don't know but um it could work let me know what you guys think what is the proper answer for the question when somebody asks you can you sublimate onto cotton is it yes because clearly you can very very light lighter than the treated shirt and way lighter than a polyester shirt but i don't know if the camera's doing it any justice but it's still usable you ever see like a vintage papa smurf shirt or something like that or my little pony something like that or faded it's usable guys i really think that this is fine if it's the look that you're going for you know it's light but it's still it's still usable i've bought shirts like this like the real soft light cotton shirts like almost thin that have that vintage type of faded look it's still useful it has its purpose now of course does this spray-on stuff work the answer is yes because it's bright it's it's somewhat vivid you can see the colors better but you have these little blotches which means you need to find a better way to apply the uh material or the liquid to your shirt guys so i hope this video was helpful hope it wasn't too long i hope i didn't talk too much which i know i did if i have to if you have to say you if you have to question yourself on something

images\nonto white or light-colored garments. By relying on the light shades\nof a cotton or synthetic fabric, many light inkjet heat transfer\npapers produce vibrant results that feel soft when transferred,\nbut are durable enough to handle washing and stretching\nwith little fading or cracking. Inkjet transfer papers are\ndesigned to work with most home or office inkjet printers. So all that's needed is a way\nof cutting the printed transfer, such as a contour cut-ready\nvinyl cutter or scissors, and a heat press for the\nbest transferring results. Before printing on light\nheat transfer paper, be sure that the image is mirrored\nthrough either the printer's drivers or the software you\u2019re printing from. After cutting the printed transfer, we\ncan begin setting up the heat press. Firm pressure is ideal for\nmost inkjet transfer papers. However, other settings like\ntime and temperature should be set to the manufacturer\u2019s\nrecommendations. Once the machine reaches\ntemperature, we\u2019ll first preheat the garment to clear any\nwrinkles and moisture out. Then place the transfer\nfacing down on the garment, cover it with a protective sheet, and press! When the press is done, remove\nthe cover sheet and gently stretch the transfer area of your garment. Peel off the protective layer from\nthe transfer and it's done!

sharing with you my all-time favorites from organic basics for lounging around the house or pretty much all of us we've just been at home for these last couple of months and for me when I'm at home I don't necessarily want to be in sweats all the time or pajamas I feel like it's not that good for my mental health I like to get up get dressed every day and you know just it just makes me feel a little bit more productive and gives a little bit of normalcy to my new everyday life I guess but at the same time I don't like to wear the normal clothes that I wear out because it's not as comfortable as like pajamas or sweats so I think I found like a really good middle ground with some items from organic basics I really really love these items they are super comfortable they're sustainable and they would also you know easily easily transition into just normal life after this Kovach quarantine so I wanted to share these items with you guys today the disclaimer I was sent to all of the items I'm mentioning in this video but like I've mentioned before I only mention products on my channel that I truly love and that I would even purchase with my own money and these definitely qualifies I just want to create a video share with you guys my favorites from organic basics I've been loving and wearing all the time I will have a link for all of these products that I'm mentioning in this video so if you guys see anything you like in this video make sure to check out the link down in my description box below and I also have a code that you can enter at checkout and that code will be down in the description box also alright so the first item that I have from organic basics is this organic basics tencel light singlet and I really really love this I think this item is by far my favorite out of all the items I'm mentioning in this video it's so soft it's like so so soft and as the name suggests it's made from a material called tensile which is a natural like wood pulp fiber so it comes from it's a natural material and this singlet it's it's just it's so soft it's so soft and it's really really comfortable on its really fitted and it really hugs your body so it almost feels like you're not wearing anything and it does have quite a bit of stretch to it so it's quite stretchy I got this in a size extra small which is my normal size and I had thought about sizing up to a size small because I don't like my tanks and t-shirts to be super super skin tight but I'm actually really happy that I didn't sign up for this and that I stuck to my normal size because it just fits really really wonderfully and I feel like I'm I got a small it might be just a tad too big but this thing'll it's basically just a cami and it does come in other colors it comes in black white this dusty rose color and also a some light like sky-blue color so I got it in this dusty rose and it just goes with so much and it's also quite girly I feel like in this rose color and I don't know just for like lounging around at home it just act like a nice soft a bit of colour to my like you know my leggings which are black and such so I really really like this rose color so aside from like wearing this to lounge around in I've also like slept in this it's so soft I know I keep mentioning that but it also looks really really good just worn as a cami with a pair of like mom jeans or some you know like longer length denim shorts this is super super cute like this with some high-waisted denim shorts and like Dad tennis shoes I think that outfit that look is really in right now and it's just super cute so I really really love this singlet it's just it's just perfect like yeah I would totally buy this I think I'm gonna pick this up in a couple of other colors perhaps the black and the white and I know that you know it just might seem like a standard cami so you're probably wondering like oh why would I go and buy it from organic basics the reason is really because you know organic basics they're very they're very very sustainable brand first of all I actually did a video highlighting organic basics and their sustainability practices I will link that video over here in fact that they're very sustainable and you know that this cami the quality of this is just I don't think you know I haven't I don't haven't had a cami that's this soft and the quality is quite good I would HIGHLY highly recommend this cami it's just it's super super cute and it's very comfortable it's actually for lounging around the house all right so the next item I have here is the organic basics invisible tank this is made from recycled materials and I really like that because you're not using any new materials there's no no new sort of consumption right everything is recycled so I really really like that about this tank and then also I just really like this tank because instead of really pretty like nude like rosy nude color it's I think it's showing up really washed out on camera right now but in real life it's a really pretty like new color with a bit of a like light pinky undertone to it which I really really like I think it's kind of hard to find like good new tanks so anyways I've been wearing this around the house I really love it doing that I like most about this tank top is that the straps are so thin but it's not a cami it's still a tank top never I wear like silk shirts or any you know any material that I don't want to have to wash all the time I always layer something underneath it and sometimes I don't like to wear camis underneath them because the straps you know like slip off and then it's hard to adjust especially if you have like a silk shirt over it and then perhaps like a blazer if you're at work so I thought this tank was absolutely perfect because it's both comfortable worn on its own at home if you're just lounging around but it's also very very like useful very functional for like normal life if once we return to normal life so yeah I would totally wear this it's called the invisible tank I think it's made to be worn under like it as an undershirt and I think you have functions so beautifully as an undershirt because of the color you know it just gives a little bit of like you can wear this and then your white shirts aren't really see-through you don't have to worry about like white shirts or a light-colored shirts being see-through and then the tank you know the straps are like just thick enough to prevent them from sliding but at the same time they're still super thin so that you're not wearing something like super bulky under a shirt I also love how the front in the back neckline is cut exactly the same I think it just looks a really really chic and when you're wearing it alone I think it's really nice because the back has like a little bit of a lower back lower like backline if that's what it's called but yeah it's just it looks really really nice and it's super flattering in my opinion so I really love this I would totally wear this with like a like a silk midi skirt or any sort of skirt I also think it looks really cute pair just with a pair of jeans and then maybe like a white linen shirt buttoned up over it but yeah I really really love this tank and like I said I've just been wearing this a ton the color is beautiful the material is excellent it's again very very soft and I just love these pieces from organic basics because they're really great right now we're at home but it's not you know I'm not buying loungewear that's only good for right now like I know that when life returns back to normal I'm gonna be wearing these pieces just as much as I do right now when I'm at home so really love that aspect about investing in these pieces as opposed to investing in like actual loungewear or sweats I think it's much more useful to get things like this that can easily switch back and be worn multiple times in normal day life and at work once we return back to normal life so the next item that I'm going to talk about is the organic basics yoga shorts these oh my gosh guys I'm so in love with these so these are such a like I don't even really know where to start with these shorts so I love these because of so many reasons the first thing is that this has a very thick like a very thick ribbed elastic waistband this waistband is so comfortable a lot of the yoga shorts and leggings that I have they have like a waistband that's the same material as the actual legging itself and while that's good I feel like this like ribbed elastic waistband provides so much more support than you know just your normal like legging waistband I don't know what it is but I don't know it just feels so much like sturdier and it just feels better in my opinion so I really like that the other thing that I really really like about these shorts is that well two things actually so the first thing is that I really like the length so the length of these it's like they look kind of short right now on camera but they're kind of like the perfect biker short length and I know that biker shorts are really really in right now and these are it I think these are a really really great option if you're looking for a pair of bike shorts and the reason is because you can wear these for so many other purposes other than just like trendy bike shorts so I don't often like to buy into trends because you know once the trend is done you're kind of left with something that you may not want so I tend not to buy into trends but I think this was a perfect weight for me to kind of try out biker shorts without actually in bus investing in biker shorts because I can easily wear these for any sort of exercise and also for yoga which I do do on a regular basis so these are really really great and the length I feel like it's just it's perfect it's not too short not too long I do have some yoga shorts that are really really short and so sometimes you know I'm really self-conscious or I don't want to wear them because if you're in like a semi compromising position for yoga you don't want anything to pop out so yeah that's all I'm gonna say about that but I really really love these shorts for these shorts I did get them in my normal size extra extra small small so these shorts comes in like extra small small and I think like medium large but the extra small small fits very very perfectly they don't feel big at all and so yeah I would say definitely just to order your like true size no need to size up or down um in terms of the materials for these shorts these are made out of recycled materials again which is really nice and then it also includes their silver I think what is it called let me see it's called their silver silver Tech is the material that's also in this and it's basically it's the shorts are treated with a safe permanent recycled silver salt called poly Jean which stops the growth of odor-causing bacteria on the fabric so it's in poly Jean it's not a nano silver and it has no harmful effects on the environment when washing so that's really really nice you know the fact that there's something in here that kind of keeps the odor away but then at the same time that the poly Jean material in here isn't going to leak any sort of like plastic small particles or anything like that that polyester you know would leak into the water when you're washing so yeah absolutely love these yoga shorts and would HIGHLY highly recommend these alright so the last item is one that I have talked about before I talked about this one in my sustainable brands video but this one should be no surprise it is still a favorite and I just I love this piece so much this is just their basic triangle bra in cotton in there you know organic cotton this thing guys is so soft I've talked about this in the other video and I just I still love this so much I've still been wearing at a time this is like the perfect bra for at home right now when you need you know if you just want like a little bit of coverage but you don't necessarily want to have any like wires or anything that's uncomfortable so this is just a standard triangle bra no wires nothing just super super soft cotton the straps are adjustable there it's a three hook closure or three yeah three hook closure there are three sets of like little loops here so you can kind of adjust based on your your like like band size I guess and then the other thing about this that I really like so well let me say this okay the way that this triangle bras cut is really really flattering it's really flattering because it has like this deep v but then it has this really thick band and I think the really thick band makes this extremely flattering I also really like this band because it is so thick oddly enough even though it's so thick it's very very comfortable it's not it doesn't dig in at all I feel like because it's so thick it's just you know it's not like one thin part digging into your skin it's just like a really really comfortable like band around around your like whatever you call this area but yeah it's super super comfortable and I just absolutely love this and all of the cotton that organic basics uses it is like certified Oh a Kotex I think it was what it's called Oh certified cotton if I'm incorrect about that like the name of the certification I'll put it down in the description box below but I'm pretty sure that's the certification they have so yeah absolutely absolutely love this bra it's just you know very nice quality very detailed like every seam is like you know it's kind of like a I don't even know what this call it's like a crisscross stitch or something but just huge attention to detail on these pieces from organic basics so I got this in an extra small so my normal size again it fits perfectly I would not recommend sizing up or down and yeah this is just I feel like the perfect piece for at home and then even when we you know return to normal life I would totally just wear this on the weekends with like a white tee over it I think it's really cute when you wear kind of like like a thinner white tee with like a black triangle bra and then some denim shorts or mom jeans I think the look is really cute super chic so yeah absolutely love this triangle bra if you guys are in the market for a good comfortable bra for sleeping in for wearing around the house just for a little bit of coverage I would highly recommend this one and I feel like okay so I I don't have very big boobs as you can probably see like I'm pretty flat and so I love wearing triangle bras as much as I can which most of the time I can because I don't need that much support but yeah this one is by far my favorite out of all the triangle bras that I own alright guys

cutter and in today's video we're going to be showing you some sublimation temperatures and press times i've created an updated sublimation temperature guide to go along with this video that you can download and follow along and also keep handy if you're considering getting into sublimation or just starting out be sure to check out our before you buy videos that i did for the sawgrass printers part 1 covers everything you would want to know about the printer's ink and then even shows you the setup and installation while part 2 shows you the finer details of how the software works i also plan to update and re-release the part 2 video whenever sawgrass releases the next big update when we also have some content over the horizon that goes into the finer details of sublimation toner so make sure you subscribe to the channel to receive all that future content so let's go ahead and take a look at that sheet underneath our fancy new logo we've got a few links that you can click that'll take you to our selection of blanks and other stuff followed by a very important disclaimer that i'll quickly read to you the following chart should be used only as a starting place producing quality end products is a matter of suitable substrates a calibrated heat press smart color management following manufacture guidelines testing and practicing so that's some very good information it is so valuable that i also put an asterisk next to the press time and temperature columns to hammer this point home even more you should always look for additional or specific directions from the manufacturer when pressing a new substrate on this guide you will notice that each item has a range of suggested temperatures and times so again always check to see if there's additional instructions that come with your blanks the more instructions you have i can guarantee the less time and products you'll end up wasting having to figure it out underneath that i made sure to put a link to our youtube channel and this video so let's get to the chart we've got a few categories here going across the top starting with substrate followed by press time then temperature pressure and then some tips and tricks you might be wondering why i have a range listed for the press time and then also some of the temperatures this is because some substrates and some inks require a different temperature for example if you're using sublimation toner the suggested starting temperature is at 380 degrees fahrenheit for all types of materials unless specified otherwise by a manufacturer some users using ink also prefer to use lower temperatures but with higher press times to ensure that there's no chance of the design to get yellow like you see here when i burnt this early draft of the sheet onto this mug the very first item that we have listed here is the ceramic mugs the press time range is anywhere from 150 seconds to 210 seconds the temperature is anywhere from 370 degrees fahrenheit to 400 degrees fahrenheit your pressure is going to be medium around 40 psi and some tips and tricks are start the countdown timer when the mug and mug press are up to temperature what i mean is when you put a mug inside of it and start it up it's going to cool the mug press down a lot like you see here so wait until it gets up in one of these ranges i usually wait till it gets around like 370 like you see here and then i start my countdown timer so that is what i mean by that and then obviously remove the transfer once the mug is cooled down next we have the metal substrate and now when we're talking about metal we're talking about flat surfaces we're also talking about you know round surfaces like mugs or a cup and all colors white silver stainless steel and bronze so this is going to be much quicker because metal conducts heat much fatter than ceramic does so 60 to 80 seconds 375 degrees to 400 degrees fahrenheit around 40 psi medium temperature heat resistant tape around the edge of the transfer is really helpful and then use a non-stick sheet when possible that way you don't have it directly making contact with your platen so up next we've got the ceramic and glass tiles and this is going to be a little bit different and you notice we've got a big time difference here temperature is going to be like everything else you know 380 degrees to 400 degrees fahrenheit uh 40 psi medium but with these you want to be very careful you want to press them from the back you know transfer side face down like into the silicon pad so that means you really want to have your silicon pad preheated and then be very careful when you're pressing it down using too much pressure could cause the tile to break now back to that first tip you know press the towel face down into the transfer you don't have to do that because personally i don't you just really want to be careful when pressing it because it could break and you know too much heat could cause it to yellow so be careful when you're doing that next you have your polyester fabric and then we also put the mouse pads here because you know they're kind of covered in polyester fabric now the recommended time for these is 45 seconds and as you can see it has the standard sublimation temperature range of 380 degrees fahrenheit to 400 degrees fahrenheit with the normal medium pressure so nothing special there but with this you want to look for a tighter knit and higher white point for better colors and what they mean by that is you know tighter knit means you don't have any like loose threads coming up because if you have a tighter knit and less loose threads you're going to get a sharper image that's the key to getting a sharper image on a shirt you're not going to get as sharp as you would like say on a ceramic or metal surface so that's why you're not going to see as many options in the sawgrass print manager for just polyester fabrics but again please check out that before you buy video part two now up next is an item that i personally wanted to put on there because i received a lot of questions about how to do this one and that's the square sequin pillowcase we're going to press it for about 45 to 55 seconds anywhere from 380 degrees fahrenheit to 400 degrees fahrenheit with medium pressure and you want to use a pressing pillow and a non-stick sheet to get the best results here the cloth side can also be used for sublimation so make sure you do the design on that too now i'm going to skip the soft link t-shirts and the vapor apparel because they're just like doing normal polyester fabrics we just left them on here because they're very popular on the search results but i'm going to go to the uni sub products and these are going to be like your metallic blanks and stuff just want to peel off the plastic coating if there's one present and then you know peel the transfer away as soon as possible it's just a very distinct product that we did carry at one time and i wanted to make sure that we left that on here then finally i wanted to talk about the fr plastics or flame retardant plastics now what these are are plastics that have a higher melting point that won't melt when you heat press them around like 380 degrees to 400 degrees fahrenheit basically these plastics are sublimatable because we're going to be applying a lot of heat to them these have a lot of different instructions even the square sequin pillowcase uses a type of plastic like this so that's going to be pretty much the basics for these as you can see this list will cover your sublimation toner as well as your sublimation ink but it's still just a starting guide so make sure that you look into the manufacturer's specifications for whatever blank that you're using well it seems like a good time

this is not clickbait in this video we're actually going to show you how you can print t-shirts from home using a home printer that's right guys you're literally going to be able to do this at home and we're actually going to show you how to do it in less than one hour and all you need is some transfer paper some scissors some t-shirts blank ones like iron tape measure and some ingenuity know all you need is a design and some of you guys may be wondering why would you do this and to that I answer speed the speed of getting an idea to market whether it's to attend an event or in my case we actually got to get to my niece and nephews birthday party and they want me to go out there put on a presentation for them and you know just give them a good time and we literally have to leave in less than one hour from here so we got to get this entire process done and we're going to show you how to do that in a few minutes so in order to really get started the first thing that you're going to need to do start with the design process so but even before that let's set up a timer real quick one hour timer so you guys know exactly how long each of these steps take so the first thing that you're going to want to do in my case guys since I have no idea what design I want to create we're gonna get started with Pinterest and since I know that they're having a prehistoric theme like they told me hey we want dinosaurs we want all this what I want to do like the first thing that came up to mind was Jurassic Park so I'm gonna look up Jurassic Park and to see what comes out on Pinterest Pinterest is such a good place to just get ideas once you guys have exactly the direction for the direction that I want to personally take is using the Jurassic theme but actually showing the two dinosaurs since I have a niece and a nephew and they're both twins I actually want to create two dinosaurs one of them a female one of them a male dinosaur and how do we tell them apart we're gonna put a bow on one of them and and then from there we're gonna write prehistoric right on the Jurassic thing so I literally will just open up Photoshop and manipulate the original logo in order to create that and it's as simple as opening up the the actual software if you guys don't have access to Photoshop just go ahead and use the affiliate links right below this video it help you do this super quick and it's as simple as just manipulating some simple images adding a bow creating the font that looks similar to Jurassic Park and we are now good to go you know what I wanted to kind of explain how the science of this works but then I was like wait a minute my brother is actually really good so let me explain what's going on please how's it going what are you guys doing so like john was saying you guys need some explanation I'm here for that wait first of all my little okay alright so real quick before you guys get started if you're printing on black or printing on what you're going to want to use depending on which one you have different tranche of papers so the black shirts or dark colored shirts you're going to want to use this one the reason being is if you have any white InDesign it's gonna show up since printers don't print out white will just show up as white on your design but if you were to use this light color design this white that's here will actually show up as a back of the shirt because this this fabric transfer paper for white shirts is clear so just keep that in mind please don't make the mistake of choosing the wrong one for your design because don't blame him or me for your not explaining correctly follow these directions and you guys will be good alright so now the printers these are pretty big yeah so these printers there's a big difference too as well please keep this in mind you can only use these transfer papers on inkjet printers some of you may be wondering well what's a inkjet printer this is an inkjet printer and this is a laser printer well how do you know what my ass is it says laser right there okay anything do the sanity then they're gonna have to open it up and if it looks like this then its laser you have all the toner here laser printers use toner and if you don't use the right printer don't come crying to us okay cuz we've got enough without already so please use this paper and then don't use regular paper that's in your printer will not work you can't believe how many people are trying to follow in these instructions using regular print paper doesn't work I've tried it alright so we're doing the wipes colored for shirts first and with whites if you read the instructions you actually have to invert the image because if not when you'll find it on it's going to come out backwards let's go ahead and print out some printers actually have the option to revert the image too so you might be able to do it just on your printer but just to be safe just make sure you do it on Photoshop so we got this thing now you see that actually came out really good I'm actually happy sometimes our printer likes to mess things up so this one came out really nice so I don't want to mess this up so I'm gonna take them on a little time here make sure I got a good one so this one is actually gonna go that way flip it that's the reason that we inverted it question where'd you get the shirt this shirt actually yes these shirts are actually blanks from Bella canvas so we're gonna be using Bella canvas as a blank for this video they're actually an amazing sponsor of the channel and they just launched a retail side of their service so for the longest time you can only buy it through distributors or you have to be a wholesaler to get access to all they're blanks they now allow anybody watching that means you to actually buy it from their entire website and I'll actually link that right below in the description so you guys can get access to a lot of different shirts I'm using the 3001 Bella canvas sure just because it's a hundred percent cotton and that's important to note to guys is you want to make sure that you're using cotton shirts or you're using a cotton blend shirt it doesn't print on this this stuff doesn't say you could print out anything else so just kind of make sure that you stick to the cotton it's the most popular size anyways so I'm gonna just go ahead and iron a little bit just to make sure I get the right little placement right there on a chest go ahead and do that before you get started and now that that's flat I'm gonna measure out with my measure here do this thing up we're gonna measure three inches from the neckline this is going to be important if you guys are doing multiple shirts like say everybody and their mom's wanted it you can kind of eyeball it I'll do exactly like a little bit less than three inches on this one and then you just kind of Center it and did a bad job ironing that but I'm eyeballing it we're really crunched on time but since I'm making a couple people more consistent with where I place them by using that eyeball the straightness of it it's a little bit that's right look at that yeah the fluid look that's how you now you don't mess it up guys students do it right the first time and what I'll do is I'll kind of just lay this heater on there just move it around very slowly to just kind of get it set in there first think I'm ready so now let it cool and I like go for 2 min I'm gonna let it cool for two two minutes that's what it says on here guys two minutes and then peel once it's cool all right at this point in time I think it would be really good to say do not copy designs 100% and print them on a shirt like this and then go sell them at school don't do that you might make a lot of money but I think the other part is you might get in trouble for it but the other part is who's gonna find out Google's gonna find out it's right there watching you they they watched you watch me make this shirt and as you can see as long as you kind of change up the design enough you're in you're within like a copyright boundary so if you could change around 40% to 60% of the art then your kind of in the clear you could be good to go and sell these on your site but if you're just straight-up stealing supreme stickers and your freakin iron them on there guys it's not going to be cool people are gonna know it's a fake still can make some good money but don't do that and now we are going to peel this thing off so it says to start at the edges go really slow you want to go super slow on this thing any of the image start to peel up only check that out guys that looks fresh prehistoric all Mainland a printer from home you guys to see super fresh we're going to do this we're going to do the same to the dark colored shirts and this thing started [Music] [Music] yeah yeah it's good look at that actually hold up what a good test even though it's an accident it holds up pretty good it actually seems like it's not peeling off so I thank you guys for watching this video if you enjoyed it make sure you stick around for the latest videos coming to this channel where we continue to show you guys how to build your brand new

that subscribe", "l4tQnsP_4Wc": "I am welcome to my channel my name is Francis and it is with you I'm going to show you how you can treat this beautiful Ankara patch that you can see here and I'll show you how I can actually sew it on your t-shirt or your sweatshirt whichever you have you don't just do this by parting in fabric and then sewing it on top of your t-shirt a couple of things you need to do which I'm going to show you how to do if you are here are you an associate our channel please click the subscribe button so you get updates win and pushing your videos to achieve something like this you do not necessarily need to have just you can use any pattern of fabric that you have into any shape that you want so I have matching shots with my patch if you want to know how to make this shots with fabric in order to make your patch what you want to do first is to sketch out the shape of watching wounds as no patch say can be able to fly can be map of Africa it can be anything so you can either sketch it out or you can even print it from the internet and then cut it out and use as new pattern so right now I'm going to be sketching like a shape of a butterfly with focus mainly just on the wings so just go ahead and do something like this [Music] by the time I caught this out you see that it's great to have a shape similar to a butterfly so just go ahead and thought this out I forgot to cut it out like this and when you open it up you're going to have something like this can you see that it's sort of like has he shaped similar to a butterfly so what I'm going to do now is get my piece of fabric so I'm going to place this on top you can either place it on top straight like this on cutouts or you can fold your fabric in suit you fold your pattern in suit like this and then go ahead and hots the shape out on your fabric after cutting it out on fabric you should have something similar to the pattern and this is what I have so can you see that the next thing you would need to do is to go ahead and picking this up I'm using these very very light fusible interfacing so I just place it like this press it down with a hot iron to fuse it together so once I do that I'm going to be doing another layer of interfacing so I wanted to be that thick so I'm doing two layers so I'll take it to my pressing area and then press this down really well and then once you do that why you need to do is to go ahead and hot this out the next thing we're going to do after fusing the main fabric to the interfacing is to take this to a sewing machine now we're going to be doing is the exact stitch use the title zigzag stitch that you have the one that is very close together to over lock the raw edges of this butterfly this will prevent your entire fabric form free or loosening out over time so just use your zig-zag stitch to unlock the raw edges all around this bottle fly after using my zig-zag stitch on the fabric this is what it looks like this is what I have and when I have to do two stitches in the middle of the butterfly so every sort of look like an imitation of a butterfly stitch is ready you can go ahead and not stitch the middle of your what a fly fabric next I'm going to do is figure out where I want my butterfly to be on my t-shirt if I want it to be at the center or if I wanted to be you know at the side like this so just go ahead and figure out where I want to attach this so I made these two strips of fabric that are sort of like be using as the antennae for my butterfly so what I'll do is just stitch the top down so the raw edges dozing like sure I'll stitch the top down for both of the fabric strips and then I'll just insert sits right here inside the other one right here can you see then I'll take this to my sewing machine and I would stitch all around the bottle fly on the fabric before you go ahead and stitch please make sure that you pin this down so it doesn't move easily while you are stitching so you'll be able to you know stitch very correctly so guys I'm done stitching my butterfly and the antennae on my fabric and this is what I have can you see how beautiful this butterfly looks right here I hope you enjoyed this tutorial

be seeing you guys in my next video bye", "Zy4lYyirAok": "hi guys I'm Alison from crafting boss and today I'm going to show you how you can use heat transfer vinyl along with your Cricut to design t-shirts and other apparel alright so some of the things that you're gonna need today a t-shirt or whatever apparel you're gonna be ironing on the heat transfer vinyl and the colors that you've selected a cutting machine today I'll be using my Cricut along with my design space I also have an ironing and an ironing board ready to go the first step in the process is going to be figuring out what you want to design you're going to want to use your design space to upload images or text or a logo or other document from your computer once you have all that loaded into the design space you're going to size into the appropriate size in this case since I'm going to be designing a small t-shirt with my company logo I size my design to be about eight inches wide by just over two inches high now that I'm happy with the size and placement of my design I'm gonna come to the upper right hand corner and click the green make it button this will take me to the next screen on this screen I'm able to see exactly how my HGV needs to be positioned on my Cricut map in order to cut the full image one thing that's really important to remember for every HTV project is to hit them nearer for iron-on button what this does is flip the numbers so that you're not ironing on in Reverse after you've done this you're going to come to the bottom right hand corner and click continue at this time I go and I grab my cricket map and I get my HTV in place where it needs to go okay so from my design I'm actually going to be using two different colors so I'm going to be positioning them as they would need to be once the images in the ER you'll notice that for my pink and my white there is a white backside for both and then a clear plastic side for each you're going to want to make sure that the clear plastic is the side that goes facedown so now I'm going to work on getting my vinyl into place [Music] and now I'm ready to load into the machine and start cutting okay once your HTV is on your mat and in place you're going to want to make sure you set the dial on your Cricut to iron on once you see that iron has correctly been selected you can load your machine you'll do this by taking your mat holding it flush to the bar and hitting the blinking button once the machine has adjusted itself you'll see the crooked button start flashing your next step is to press the cricket button to start your hub [Music] once your machine is done cutting you're going to want to pick the flashing button again to release the map from the cricket the next step is to take your weeding tool and weed out your excess HTV so once your mats been removed from your cricket you're going to want to appealing your HTV off the map and start reading reading basically means removing any extra material that you don't want iron on your shirt you'll see that while I'm pulling up the extra material the clear plastic backing is staying in place [Music] all right when you're done you're going to want to keel your design off your mat all right so once your design is fully weeded the next step is to prep your shirt for ironing what I've done is I've laid out the shirt that I plan to use and I use used chalk and a ruler to measure the center of where I'd like my design to be placed and then also measured and marked the center of the shirt when going to iron my design on this will help me with placement that way it's absolutely perfect when it's done okay so your next step is to get your iron on and warm and get your t-shirt in place now we're going to take our design and sticky side down you're gonna use your graph to position your design on top of the shirt you're going to press your design onto the shirt the next step is to take either white cloth or even a white pillowcase will suffice you're going to put it over your design and then you're going to take your iron and you're going to apply pressure this process will take approximately 30 to 45 seconds depending on how thick or thin the lines are in your design and how hard you're pressing what I've noticed is that thinner lines usually take a little bit longer to iron on than thicker lines [Music] one thing I forgot to mention is that you want to make sure that with your iron settings you have it on a no steam settings when you feel like you've ironed enough you can pull up your sheet cover and slowly peel up around the edges you'll be able to tell pretty quickly if you need to iron more or if your iron iron-on letters are fastened well to the shirt you're going to slowly peel at an angle and if you find any spots that stick you just want to go back over them lightly with the iron [Music] after you've pulled it off your plastic sheet you're gonna want to make sure that you put your pillow clay case or white cotton towel back on top of the design and re iron for another 10 to 15 seconds this just ensures that your design is placed on the shirt extra well [Music] after that you're all set to wash and wear and here's our finished product if you liked today's tutorial please make sure to like comment share and also follow our youtube channel for more great videos if you want even more information head over to crafting brass comm where you can check out some of my free guides tutorials or great business and marketing workshops and other great tools all right see in the next video [Music]", "YTrDucbyRtU": "[Music] hi I'm David gross with conde systems back with you to share a little bit of my wisdom for sublimation success well one of the questions I have been asked for for many years going back to when I started doing civil nation was in 1992 asked can you sublimate two things that are not white well when I first started selling Maine that was the rule you you the thing needed to be white whatever you sublimate it to where there was a tile piece of metal needed to be white and so when the subject of sublimating two colors came up i said well that didn't sound like a good idea because we didn't have perfect color reproduction on a non-white substrate okay and of course you know so nation doesn't have white ink so we start with the sub sublimation process starting with white and we can go all the way to the black if we're sort of already yellow we have a limited color spectrum and so all this kept kept me saying the same thing that I just didn't think it was such a good idea to sublimate to something that wasn't white well long cane vapor and of course experience and people calling me and telling me the great success they had with sublimating to things that are not not white like fabrics for instance and and of course many years ago I had to sort of change my tune and I have been startled by the success of things that are not white like fabrics and so our friends at vapor okay have a very large product line much of which is not white and so what I wanted to do was spend a few minutes with you talking about sort of the the the the results of sublimating to these color fabrics now when we when we sublimate we essentially so make two kinds of things we so made a graphic or a photograph graphic is like the color of a fawn or something like that and so I've right before us here I've so made it on four different color shirts to give you sort of a feel for the results and and I'm telling you the results are quite impressive and I think this is this is something that you should show your clients because it's a whole lot better in many cases then the the standard just white the the Henry Ford one size fits all I've got every color you want as long as it's black and so on this first shirt here this is sort of the we'll call it the perfect shirt we've got our photograph and at the bottom of it we've sublimated the what I call the default RGB chart which we can furnish you so you can do the same thing and on each of these shirts we've we've done the same thing so you can see the effect of the underlying color on selim ation now it's a good idea if you're going to go offer this to your clients that you sublimate a color chart to each of the color shirts so you know what the color is going to be when you soul mate to it and this allows your client for instance if you wish you can show them the shirt and you can pick out they can pick out the color they want okay so so that they'll know what the results are and over the years I've seen a lot of shirts and I'm going to show you one shirt right here that that I'm startled by the results on this shirt which is one of the performance vapor shirts I believe it has a picture of a boy on it on a surfboard and even though you know sort of in theory we shouldn't be able to have reasonably good flesh tones on this shirt lo and behold not only we do we have an awesome looking sort of a neon blue here but we have some great looking flesh tones and it's just it's just very impressive almost like you know UFOs and aliens how in the world did it turn out so good but nonetheless the colors on this shirt look spectacular and so what we need to do is we need to put our images put a photograph put put our spot colors on these so that we'll know what they are now often when we print and we're trying to pick a spot color let's say we're trying to match a school color or color on a business card something like that a small chart like this small RGB chart will not allow us to pick pick accurate spot colors so my recommendation is if you fall in love with with colored shirts like I have is that you transfer a larger chart and I carry this with this this this chart with me practically everywhere I don't have one that I could get my hands on quickly on fabrics but I should but anyway this is the palette that I'm in love with it's called the Pantone go goe and I recommend that that you transfer this chart and you can get this from us it's part of CorelDraw in most programs and transfer its shirt with this number of colors which i think is about 2000 colors you have a very good chance of nailing whatever spot color you want and so for instance let's say that we were looking to match a school color well we would go get an object from the school and match that one things you could also do with this is some of the shirts and I'm looking to see if I can put my hands on one very quickly here they have colors they have ribs and I think those are called the Phenom shirts and so you could print out this chart and you could use it to match the the rib color of the shirt and that's a common thing to try to make it look really nice and match that and you've got our website and see the Phenom shirts they're very nice and understand vapors coming out with all sorts of neat shirts that are orientated towards vertical markets like cycling or something like that so those folks at vapor are always working very hard to come out with with new styles to keep our sub lemaitre's out there helping them please their clients so the point of this video is to tell you that you can get I think excellent results sublimating to that's number one number two is often a sub lemaitre's we'll say to ourselves well we don't think it's good enough for instance when we put it on but let's say this photograph right here on yellow we don't think that's good enough but I'll tell you what the the eyes of your client and how their brain works they'll look at this and they'll say wow that looks awesome and and that's what people are looking for they're looking for something that looks a little bit different than the norm okay and and that's one of the great things that you can offer is you

fashion basics you know are we into fashion obviously yeah look at us we know like the tears of like clothes and like how much they should cost hopefully I think if I find one thing that fits me I buy it in ten colors look at it it's just a box pretty soft look at the way it's sort of I don't know what you're getting it it's a little sheer I feel like that's like a forever 21 shirt I'm gonna go $29.99 that's a $25 shirt I think it's $10 $12.99 80 bucks cuz it's too good for me it is too good for me and all that causes 15.99  1490 that's a steal beautiful it basically just sells long underwear that you're supposed to wear around which I don't hate look at this stitching it's giving me a bit of a Euro vibe this is the shittiest reversible shirt of all time for both sides look like the inside of the shirt I don't like this some detail I'd wear this in the nineteen fifties going to go chop some wood what these are all exact evidence clothes yeah this is something a Kevin said where there's two think it could be a couple more ribs down 35 that's enough dollars pretty much 29 and a half it's a trash shirt made out of garbage fabric I paid $2 for it bet you $50 $55 Tonya didn't make this so who gives a that's a deep V you know who's the king of the deep fees American Apparel it doesn't quite fit right this is a tea that you throw on to paint your porch but it's cute there's something very bold about the deepness of this V Freddie will say 14 and I will say 5 just on the off-chance that is that 1997 12 bucks $50 390 from forever yeah new it one wash will will disintegrate the sleeves against off look at the  sleeves a cap sleeve I'm dead oh did they finish this does that mean by Kleenex if I was lady I'd wear this at first I was like it's so thin but I'm like oh it's kind of luxurious yeah it's more so like thin but like that on purpose this wear on my body you could see well all my bits I think it's $85 I'm gonna say 65 65 1554 60 if this costs more than $8 then this is highway robbery how the hell did you know that oh my god I knew is gonna be expensive I don't think I got any of these right do I not know that much about t-shirts you know what I want to put this thing on how I put this why see what $85 feels like you know it's one of those things where like this might be the kind of basic that'll last forever and in that case maybe it's worth it I've changed my mind I've never found so curious I mean you were all willing to pay a little bit more for quality but if it's a white t-shirt who gives a you're gonna spill coffee on it in five minutes so just people out there that are buying these shirts stop quick imagine just seeing me in Ralph's like taking cover areas like this it's smelling a page if you want to buy Kanye West's $120 a PC t-shirt by all means and if that's what you want to do totally do it it should not have cap sleeves yeah there's mine and there's another one you got both of them I only talked to $85 plan now this shirt is powerful", "arC41M3Fs4Q": "[Music] hi everyone I'm Jan from pins-and-needles in Cleveland Ohio and so it online and one of the questions during this math challenge is how do i make ties we know that there's hardly no elastic in the world if you have some of you're one of the very few so what we came up with is just taking a man's t-shirt now I don't bring a man's t-shirt with me today so I am just cutting up the bottom of this t-shirt that was in our store it says I don't need therapy I just need my sewing machine now isn't that true so what I'm doing is I want you to lay out a t-shirt rather just imagine in your mind right now a man's white t-shirt doesn't matter what color it is doesn't matter if you're Truman if you're if it's a man's okay we're just taking knit fabric you could also look in your sewing stash and see if you have some t-shirt fabric that uh but I'm trying to do this for the mask people for the the mass market who may not have t-shirt fabric in their stash but I bet you you got a t-shirt you could give up so all I'm doing is cutting across the bottom hem and getting rid of that ham that's not nothing that you have to throw away that's a tie cut it apart and it's a tie so there's no waste here but then what I'm going to do is I'm going to move an inch and a quarter and I'm just going to cut across here one and a quarter inches and I'm going to keep going all the way up my t-shirt following me so what did that do that made me a tube because the front in the back is is cut at the same time so now I forgot a tube here so what I'm going to do now is that measures watch out that measures about 22 inches double so 44 inches but now when I pull it it because all I'm doing is pulling this is your break time this one's got a seam in the sides most of them don't have a seam in the side so now look at how much I've made do see how that coiled so now it is down to 23 it came to me about an extra 12 inches so now you just use that for your elastic use that for your ties if you're making the kind of go here and you're using elastic just make it it's about 8 inches and tie it you don't even have to sew it together just tie it in a double knot if you're going to use them as I have in all my masks they're just the ties and I just use them this one hasn't been pulled yet but to get to get you the idea okay so this coils and it's very soft so you're just going to use your piece and cut it and happen you're done so consider using this for your ties but everybody keeps asking me how do I do it how do I do it I just showed you cut it across pull it it becomes a coil no you do not have to sew this down it washes like a dream it's softer it's easier it's comfortable go for it give up a shirt there the hero today keep sewing the mask folks we're not done with this I know your friends and neighbors still need them we know the hospitals I just got a call this morning from rainbows children's here in Cleveland and they want masks for kids so we are not done with this ballgame I would tell you that I get phone calls from hospitals on an everyday basis asking me for these as well as nursing home Police Department's asking them for them so we're not done keep selling and thank you thank you for all you've done hope to see a real bit real soon [Music]", "B0g0GC0Omlc": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

outerwear and out the door we go at least I believe that's what in scarcity when it comes to like choosing t-shirt you want a good balance of quality because just the amount of money you put in for me Uniqlo supima cotton t-shirt sits on that sweet spot the t-shirt isn't too expensive and it's made up of supima cotton so a little background if you guys are not familiar with supima cotton it's basically like to the best of my knowledge superior from mixup on 1% of Earth's cotton resources if you dive deeper the reason why supima cotton is such a great company is because the nature of its cotton it's able to retain the color dye as well as offer a smoother texture compared to other type I'm not really like a huge fan of my printed t-shirt having a printed t-shirt means you're putting a crime stamp onto this t-shirt once this print it's out of fashion your t-shirt is about window and me it's not really an idea that subscribe because I think to some extent we can all contribute and do our part to maintain the longevity of the clothes that we have to do our parts for the environment moving on let's talk about colors some of the basic colors that I stick to I like black gray white maybe and allowing a random color that suits my mood so in this case this season it's like this sort of dark green color I thought it'd give up their military vibe it's something I'm trying out this time this t-shirts are like stable so you can get them all year round as long as there's a Uniqlo store near you what are some of the basic color you guys have let me know in the comment section down

if you have not already and I'll see you in the next video bye guys have a great day [Music]", "qST-tWStGnk": "hey guys welcome back to my channel i hope you're doing great i am doing fantastic thank you for asking you don't care do you anyway today we're going to be doing super easy revamps to your old t-shirts and the first one is going to be a split t-shirt i had a red and yellow t-shirt and i thought this color combo would be beautiful and they could be great together i like me and my ex so first things first is i cropped my t-shirt obviously i love my stuff cropped it's still summer please let me live in quarantine still but let me live okay if you want this to be as long as your legs you live your life and let me live my life and let's be peaceful with each other so i'm just cutting through the line i just drew i basically went below that point because i got a bit scared she would be a bit too cropped and after i done everything i marked nine inches which was my midpoint and to the right of that point i marked half an inch so you need this half an inch she's going to be your seam allowance she is going to allow you to be great and she is the reason you're going to get into law school okay so you need to do this and basically i just draw a straight line through the half inch mark and i'm going to cut through that straight line and divide my t-shirt into two so the reason we're adding in the half inch is it's going to be our seam allowance when you move on to joining it with the other piece so just do it to be safe i also got rid of the tag she was a bit toxic i didn't like her vibe her energy so i used a red t-shirt on my second t-shirt to just get a rough idea of why i'd crop her and i drew a stray line through the point cut that out to crop this t-shirt as well and it's basically the same thing we did with a red t-shirt and after you're done cutting get rid of the bottom bit or make a house from it it's your world and you do whatever you want so now i just marked the midpoint and then half an inch from that midpoint on the left side this time so you need the seam allowances to be on the opposite sides that way when you join the two pieces together they make a complete t-shirt that actually seems like it was meant to be two t-shirts in one don't let it be weird and people are asking questions and they wonder why you saw your own clothes why you're always broke why you're forever alone just avoid the questions you know that not everyone needs to know that so just do whatever you need to do to seem profesh so i also got rid of the tag in this t-shirt and i split it in half as you saw and now it's time to join the two pieces together forever they're here to stay whether they like it or not so i'm just joining the back pieces and i'm putting the right sides together and i'm going to pin that entire edge together and we're going to sew it and our t-shirt will be attached at the back so pin everything together so a zigzag stitch to join the two pieces and now for the front bit you're going to flip this inside out that way you can join the right sides together so when sewing your right sides always need to be together unless it's a different concept and in that case i will tell you but here we're doing right sides together and i also marked a five inch mark because i wanted my shirts to have a v-neck you know show some cleavage a bit but not too much a very subtle v-neck and i pinned all the way down from the v-neck and you're going to sew along the pins a zig-zag stitch as well because she's stretchy and this is going to join your t-shirt together and you will basically be done so i'm just doing my zigzag stitch nothing fancy make sure you backstage make sure you're paying your taxes make sure you're quarantining and everything will be fine so once i'd sewn my zigzag stitch your t-shirt is basically joined together but as you can see mine's longer on one side it's a whole mess but let's fix that so i just drew a straight line through the longer bit cut the excess bit of fabric off and you're basically good to go so i decided the shirt wasn't enough of whole material for me i needed to deepen the v-neck you don't have to do this it's totally optional i just wanted my v to look neat and pretty and actually look like it was meant to be there so i just decided to cut off excess fabric from it this was super simple to do and once that was done i made sure to stretch all the cut edges and your t-shirt is now beautifully done i also folded in the sleeves because i'm super cool and i couldn't help myself if you're not cool enough to do this i understand not everyone can do this i'm kidding if you want to fold in the sleeves you do that someone might actually take me seriously so i do have to be cautious but don't feel limited do different colors do purple and black do yellow and red do white on white no actually don't do that because that is pointless and they're just wasting your time be creative but use your common sense so now i'm going to show you how to revamp a v-neck t-shirt this is a men's t-shirt by the way size extra small i love how big men's t-shirts are like this is an extra small and it looks like a medium on me whereas female clothes are just a whole different sizing my goodness let's not get into that but this color is gorgeous it's such a fall color though we're not yet in full it's coming i'm praying for this year to end quickly and if i have to make fall diys for it to be fall you bet i'm gonna do it so all i'm doing now is i'm marking a line below the point i marked i was a bit scared with cropping this time i thought i was cutting my t-shirts too short but i was just paranoid maybe the whole life is actually leaving me but i cut through the straight line to crop the t-shirt and now you are good to go you have another tube top to make another house to make depending on what you decide to do with the bottom bit so now using the v point as a guide i'm just going to draw a straight line down and this is going to help me split my t-shirt open and i'm just cutting through the top layer only and splitting my t-shirt making her ready for the next step i turned this inside out and i'm now folding in the side bits twice and pinning them down so basically i was attempting to make kind of like a button placket makeshift one it didn't go so well but i wanted her to be cute so i just folded in the fabric twice pinned her in place repeat on the other side as well and you're now going to do a straight stitch alongside the edges on both sides so gasp straight stitch stretchy fabric who am i so the reason i'm using a straight stitch despite having fabric that did try me a lot i wanted the straight stitch first of all the zigzag stitch is extra she needs space she needs to be seen and i wanted this to be more subtle and since i didn't need this bit to stretch i could get away with a straight stitch so you do what you feel is right for your fabric but i felt like she had to behave or get out there was no two ways about it so now for buttons i'm going to be using pearls because i'm expensive i'm kidding they're actually fake pearls i got on aliexpress for like a dollar for like 100 of them i will link them down below in case you want to be expensive with me and now all i'm doing is i'm marking an inch all the way down that's what you just saw me do because i was busy just making noise and now i'm going to hand sew each and every pearl button with love so that she serves me in the right way and doesn't escape to go be with her longtime summer boyfriend i need her to stay with me okay so i made sure she was in there i really did sew on these buttons with all my energy i was not letting any button go and once i was comfortable with how secure she was i secured the knot got rid of the excess thread and repeated the entire process all through so hand sewing the buttons was definitely a trying period for me i don't want to think back to this time because i really did spend a lot of time on this i spent like 30 minutes sewing 10 buttons and i didn't even have to use three buttons so it was a trying time i don't want to talk about it but the buttons are on eventually so make sure you sew all of them onto your top and once they're all sewn on it's going to be worth it it's always worth it with diys you just have to be willing to put in the time so now all i'm doing is i'm taking the bottom packet now you know where the holes will be and i'm going to make sure my pearls can go through so i put it on top of the button on the other side snipped it to the tiny scissor that i don't know where i found i think this is actually for my nails am i disgusting yes but i'm just snipping a hole and making sure it's big enough for the pearl to go through i pushed the pearl in and i was basically here for my entire life the reason i don't have a boyfriend i was just doing this for my whole lifetime you will be here for a hot second so the key is to make sure your hole is not too small such that the pearl cannot go through and make sure it's not too big so that your pearl isn't just out there and everything is exposed and i don't know why my voice changed to this anyway i did this for a hot minute and once i had all my holes and all the pearls were home i was basically done i ended up removing the top three buttons by the way so don't even bother okay just because i wanted that cleavage so bad so now i'm just going to crop my t-shirt some more now that i know how long i want her to be i draw a straight line through and i'm going to cut off the excess bit of fabric this whole life chose me okay i didn't choose it and i'm also going to get rid of the sleeve hem because i didn't like her she wasn't my style she was killing my entire vibe and she had to leave the office building okay so i'm going to double hem the bottom of my t-shirt just to make it cute and we're going to do a lettuce hem and i'm going to do the same thing for the sleeves just fold in your fabric twice and sew a zigzag stitch all around and the lettuce ham is so simple you're going to repeat on the other sleeve of course unless you want to only have one sleeve that looks pretty no one's going to judge you and if they judge you please sell them to mind their business so the lattice hem is really simple to do you basically fold in your fabric twice tuck in all the ugly raw edges no one needs to see them you need to put your best foot forward and you're going to sew a zigzag stitch to just have everything in place and together i have an in-depth video on how to do a letter sam i will link it down below in case you want to really focus on the latticem and become a master of it but once you repeat this all through you have a top that is fabulous and ready to be on the urban outfitters website without making you sell a kidney so this is the final result i really love what the pearls did for this simple t-shirt they really took this t-shirt to the rich level buttons are basic everyone has buttons but pearls honey you will be super expensive you'll be on the streets and everyone will be wanting to talk to you even though you don't want them to but even if they're fake pearls no one needs to know that okay so anyway that is all i have for you guys today i thought this methods were such simple and fun ways to revamp your man's current t-shirts ex-boyfriends t-shirts whoever's leaving t-shirts at your house these are two simple ways you can easily re-fashion them that way when they come back for them they no longer have t-shirts to come back for because you've made cute summer tops from them anyway that's all i have for you guys today thank you so much for joining me in today's video i thoroughly enjoyed your company and i hope i will be seeing your beautiful face in my next video until then stay safe be beautiful and cut up everyone's t-shirts i give you my blessing you have my permission to do so see you guys soon bye", "V_fUsz_q7d4": "hi I'm Kenny with embroidery library t-shirts are the most popular garments to embroider on in this video I'll talk about designs how to position them stabilizer and hooping so you will get excellent results t-shirts are usually made of cotton or a cotton and polyester blend wash and dry the shirt before embroidering on it to get all the shrinkage out of the way choose designs that are light with open areas light designs drape beautifully on t-shirts designs that have a lot of stitches will drape poorly and you may see puckering too this wolf design looks much better on heavier fabric like a sweatshirt where you place the design is largely up to personal preference I'm using a template or a printout of a design to arrange on the shirt traditional placement has the top of the design about three inches down from the neck centered between the left and right seams that measurement may be different if you're working with a very large shirt or a very small one after you have the template placed where you want to stitch the design mark the center point and the vertical and horizontal access lines these marks will be used when hooping turn the shirt inside out spray a piece of cutaway stabilizer with temporary adhesive and smooth that on the back of the area that will be embroidered now turn the shirt right-side out again slide the outer hoop inside the shirt press the inner hoop in place lining up those marks on the shirt with the marks on the hoop roll the excess shirt up so it doesn't get caught while embroidering use clips to keep the excess out of the way embroider the design a size 11 or 75 11 embroidery needle will work well t-shirts are stretchy so cutaway stabilizer is the best choice I don't use tearaway stabilizer on t-shirts because that type of stabilizer tears away with the needle perforations and that leads to gapping and misaligned stitches after you finished embroidering the design turn the shirt inside out and cut the excess stabilizer away I leave about 1/2 inch around the design that looks great the design is light and open so the fabric is draping very well here's a crafty design on a v-neck t-shirt for the crewneck example I measured down from the neck but for this I place the design about two inches down from the point of the V usually designs are added to the front of a shirt but for this one I embroidered a pair of angel wings on the back t-shirts come in every color you can imagine and it's fun to experiment with different thread colors in this example i embroidered butterflies in bright thread on a dark navy blue shirt on this shirt i embroidered the filigree swirls in a color that's just a bit brighter than the shirt but use more contrast in the words fabric lover thanks for watching today for machine embroidery designs and tutorials visit our website at WWE library calm you", "CIGnUG9kUhs": "i get tons of questions where do you buy your black wash t-shirts if you're subscribed to the channel you know that i've been wearing black wash tees for like the past year year and a half on the channel so i'm gonna give you like 10 plus links of different websites that sell regular and or boxy washed t-shirts that potentially could be pretty affordable and great for your essentials for your wardrobe it's your boy kezie it ain't easy being easy let's get it so we're going to knock this out really quick the first brand that i want to talk about is going to be rue porter i had this uh suggested to me from a subscriber months ago now and i got hit to reporter this year they do sell these boxy slightly boxy uh t-shirts and also they sell boxy hoodies mid 2019 and in 2020 more people are using these blank t-shirts for their brands i think prior people were using a lot of all style the aaa all styles and gildans but since the tailoring of t-shirts became more popular to have something boxy people are now using reporter for that so a lot of brands that you might already buy into you might have some reporters sitting in your in your room and you don't even know it if you haven't heard of the brand now if i were to talk a little bit about the pricing the pricing is fair i mean it's under 50 bucks per t-shirt i think it's even under 30 dollars if i'm not mistaken per shirt you are allowed to buy one at a time instead of buying in bulk but when it comes to fit it to me it's not a true boxy tee i think they do need to work a little bit on how wide the t-shirts are and also the armpit area and the the cut of the armpit area because the way that it falls sometimes sometimes the middle of the t-shirt seems a little too straight and not it just doesn't look boxy enough and the the shoulders kind of seem a little overbearing but i have seen it look good on other people i'm just speaking from my own experience wearing the shirts i do wear them sometimes on the channel but with that being said let's move on to number two okay for the rest of this list i'm just gonna use my phone is a lot easier the next site we have up is called mujimujius.com i'm probably not pronouncing that correctly you might have seen it on instagram by now they make tons of great blank hoodie blank sweaters blank t-shirt options and also a ton of washes and also two different cuts i believe one is a a regular or slight box and then there's another one that is like really boxy tailoring as well price range is okay it's about 36 bucks a blank t-shirt and the hoodies will run you around 48 i am curious as to where this company is located my my gut is telling me that it's los angeles part of it also is telling me that it could be overseas i'm not 100 sure they look like a great brand i bought two of their t-shirts they're coming in the mail i don't have them yet maybe in the future for a pickups video i can give you some of the the fitting and how it worked out for me um let's go ahead and move on to number three [Music] so number three is another brand that a lot of like newer streetwear brands will use for blanks and they're they're decent blanks now they're not a boxy shape unless they make a different style number in a boxy shape and that brand is going to be comfort colors comfort colors does make i do believe an acid wash one as well but the regular adult size t-shirt is a pretty decent option again just keep in mind this one that i'm recommending is not a boxy fit but for a regular tee it's not bad i wear these on a regular basis i wear it to work just as a regular black shirt regular white shirt don't doesn't need to be anything fancy the price range is extremely cheap i think some of these run like seven bucks or even cheaper than that if you you can even buy them on amazon not really too much more to say here other than a lot of people use these blanks already you might even know this brand because that's how popular it is check them out comfort colors let's keep it pushing [Music] the next brand is going to be called all pima apparel calm i would skip straight to their blank clothing i think they sell more than just blank clothing but they seem to sell some t-shirts the one i'm referring you to is going to be the classic fit crew neck the vintage they also have it in white and they also have it in black but although it says classic sometimes you might think oh it's a regular fit but from the photos that the model is wearing it does have a little bit of a drop shoulder there and that sometimes that's a good signifier when you're looking at some of the photos and also they have it in a vintage wash which is kind of more so a fade that you're going to get like this fairly affordable about 42 bucks give or take i mean 42 dollars for one t-shirt can be a little pricey sometimes but if it works it works me personally if it works i would pay a higher dollar for it for sure you know i would rather have three t-shirts that fit me really well then 15 t-shirts that fit me like right so this could be a good option all pima apparel calm check them out let's move on to the next one [Music] to be quite honest this is not this is not affordable this is far from affordable but i put it on here because they're known for really good uh classic basics and that would be john elliott now i don't know 100 if they make boxy tailoring shirts my guess is they're more in the regular fitting department for adult size for men t-shirts and i do believe they make quite a few different options and sometimes it's hard to buy directly on the website because they sell out pretty quickly but if you're not into paying retail like a lot of people are not especially with john elliott you could go onto grail did maybe even ebay depop stuff like that people will end up selling a lot of john elliott i haven't seen you know much of replica john elliott so you're probably safe there if you happen to go through third party selling sites that sell the stuff you're probably more in the safe area but price wise again sometimes these hit they hit boy this is expensive it's kind of high uh let's just move on to the next option [Music] so a brand called levalofficial.com i don't even know how i found this uh and no i haven't bought into this yet but if you happen to go on the website try your best to go through the search bar and just type in t-shirt because if you go through shop you're just not gonna find it on the first page right but they have an item called the essential t-shirt in white and they also have it in black the white one looks a lot more boxy in tailoring it does have a tiny logo in the front but it's white on white so you might be okay there price wise these sit about 48 bucks this is what i'll say with this and i'll leave it at this it's harder to find white t-shirts than black t-shirts in my opinion because or for me anyway usually if i put on a white t-shirt and the material is too thin and you can see through it it's just game over i'm not gonna but i'm gonna i'm returning it i'm gonna return it so white could be hit or miss here if they use a thicker fabric it could be a lot better if it works for you boom there you go not much more to say let's keep it pushing [Music] next up we actually have a what looks like a women's website or girls website that sells blank t-shirts again another one i have no idea how i found this they do sell some oversized t-shirts for women they have one called the oversized power t-shirt in black they have other wash t-shirt um examples as well and i understand that this is women's sizing but i think once you get up to large or extra large that potentially could be like a large or a medium for men especially if it's oversized so it might even be bigger than that so you just have to go through it look at the dimensions and see if it works out for you maybe the oversized power t-shirt could potentially work as almost a regular slash boxy t-shirt for you price wise we're looking at 65 bucks a shirt are they all that some of them are 36 so not all of them you just have to step through it and see if the measurements work yeah not too much more to say here i thought i'd throw it in there really quickly let's uh let's keep going [Music] so 6lar.com i don't even think i'm pronouncing that one right either the the past four i don't even think i'm pronouncing them correctly but right on the home page you go to sixlar.com which i probably gave you the information here um they have a vintage charcoal blank i'm dying to know how these fit the photos look great they look really good they put measurements on there as well now i don't know if this is like uk or whatever because i was looking up some of these websites and just be careful if you're looking at the sizing us i believe goes uh height and then width but then uk is width and then height or maybe it's opposite i don't i can't it got confusing for me okay so just make sure whatever website you have hop on to especially something like this you're reading you know which one is which sometimes they put it there for you and make it easier for you and sometimes they don't but these look like a good option 42 bucks it seems that the pricing for a lot of these shirts especially the washed black t-shirts are all floating within 24 at least all the way up until 36 maybe even 50 at the most for i guess a more quality washed black t-shirt at that point but again a good option check it out report back to me if you try it [Music] next up we got summit uk.co.uk yeah i got that right i thought this was a really good option because they got washed blank hoodies in black and also like a purplish color but more importantly they have a vintage t-shirt worn black i think that's the title the model actually makes these ones look really nice they don't look like too cropped on you from what i can see on the model the only thing i you know i'm kind of whatever about even though i bought this already i haven't i haven't tried it it's coming in the mail even though i bought this is that the price is a little steep so it's about 50 pounds which is i don't even know is that like 65 or 60 or 57 58 bucks uh per t-shirt so it gets a little costly if you buy two you're you're at a hundred dollars or more okay but if it works out which again this is another one i will report back to you and i'll pick this video later on and see if it works out if it works out it works out and i'm gonna buy more than a couple i'm gonna buy like four or five of them so i can sit on them right as long as it fits and along as long as it's comfortable i think what got me to buy this one definitely was not the price but it was how washed it is i do like how faded it is the fade on this one and the wash the vintage wash on this one actually looks pretty nice it's just again that price that price kind of killed me a little bit but we're just gonna see if this one works out [Music] next one we got up is a brand called luke vicious i spoke about this in like underappreciated streetwear brands i think this might be like the second time i'm recommending this one now again this is not one that i bought into but a lot of people talk about luke vicious ton of people and he is he is a reworked vintage from what i know but he sells some blank t-shirts i don't know if he you know i don't know if these are new vintage t-shirts like remade or is it a reworked vintage blank shirts that he gets and he kind of makes it himself i don't know which one it is exactly the price is a little steeper it's sitting about 60 bucks but if you like boxy tailoring this is this is as boxy as it gets this is a true box in fact shout out to derek derek if you're watching this you were the one that said that it's a little too boxy sometimes it could be almost too cropped but some people like that and i think it depends on your body shape your height and things like that that these types of shirts that are really boxy can actually work for you yeah i would say for me personally this might be a little too crop for me i'm not personally a fan of where it's like way too high but like just enough where you can tell that it's cropped is kind of where i sit at so until i come to the day of actually trying i can give you a review but just ask other people luke vicious seems to be a pretty big account that a lot of people follow these days [Music] this next brand i don't i don't know how to officially pronounce this i'm i hear people pronouncing it as cost costs sometimes it sounds like cause like cause toys the artist the graffiti artist um but cos okay and a lot of people on a lot of different channels recommend this they even do sponsored videos but i've seen i've seen the brand and they seem to make some oversized t-shirts and some regular fitting t-shirts i would say the tailoring and the quality and all that stuff looks pretty on point especially for the price these are sometimes floating around 45 bucks maybe 50 maybe even under that and i don't really have too much more to say i've never tried it myself but i'm putting it out there for people that might be new to it and i know a lot of people watching this might be like i've been shopping with them but again there's newer people to the channel they never heard of coasts or costs check it out tons of different types of fits you know what this reminds me of it reminds me of a uniqlo except it's just rebranded and it's not uniqlo and maybe higher quality i mean uniqlo is already pretty nice quality if you ask me especially for basics again report back if you really like this brand let it be known give your review down below and the rest of us can hear it out maybe even try it [Music] this next one i am dying to know i'm dying to know if this uh this one works out i'm also dying to know if this one has dropped shoulders and is is boxy and that's going to be los angeles apparel but specifically we are looking at the 6.5 ounce pigment dye crew neck t-shirt my my gut is telling me by looking at this it's probably not cropped or boxy but by the model that they have displaying the t-shirt looks like it has a little bit of a drop shoulder so that could be a good sign i probably would just go through the size guide and see if that works out for you the coloring that they got here unfortunately they don't have black but they look like they're doing they look like they're doing all yeezy colors like they got they got like a pink you know brown beige i do wish they came in other colors i haven't spent enough time to go throughout the website and see if they do make the same cut fit and whatever in different colors if you know better leave it in the comments i'll probably spend time doing that another time so the next brand is it has an interesting name it's called boohoo man and uh this is another one i have no idea how i found it the title of the shirt is called oversized crew neck t-shirt it does seem a little bit more limited in sizing it doesn't go up to double x unfortunately but maybe an xl fits like a double x who knows the price on this though is impressive seven bucks that's how much a t-shirt should cost this does come in a white color it looks like a pretty thick solid white color as well it does come in black too this one again i'm dying to know if it works out i'm dying to know if it fits if this one works out for me because i did buy one but it's coming in the mail i bought like three or four different brands before i made this video but this is one of the ones i bought if it comes in the mail and this one really this one really rocking and really fitting then i'm gonna buy at least i'm gonna need i'm gonna need a double back and get at least like six or seven of these suckers you know and just having a rotation because right now i'm out of t-shirts i need i need better blank t-shirts right now a lot of them getting kind of raggedy i need some new this looks like some decent new at a really decent price check it out i'll try my best to give a review on this in the future [Music] okay last up is this random link i found this by going on google and i typed in boxy t-shirt and it says unisex heavy jersey box t-shirt on this site that says t-shirt wholesale price.com and lo and behold in fine print it says american apparel so it's just an american apparel t-shirt comes in a bunch of different colors whether or not it's actually boxy is highly questionable unfortunately there's not that many photos to this either but it does give you a product code down here that's hj402w you could probably look that up and and find out more information on that if we were to just judge it only purely on the model picture it doesn't look half bad and the price is the cheapest of all of them not even not even seven bucks this one is three dollars and seventy eight cents again another one i'm super curious if this one is is is even good i i don't i have no idea i'm pretty sure someone else has tried this i mean american apparel is a pretty big brand didn't they just go bankrupt anyways uh yeah hopefully this is a good recommendation i saved the best for last in price i don't know about actual you know fit and stuff like that but price wise 3.79 i mean that's damn your flea market price if you ask me [Music] the other interior motive of trying to find a boxy fitting wash t-shirt right now is because i'm trying to like recycle and sell the ones i have now or maybe just use those as pajamas and then get new ones because every every so often i do that and i just found it really interesting that i can only find these online if i were to just think off the top of my head and be like oh i need to go to the mall and find a boxy fitting t-shirt the only place i can think of that might have what i'm looking for is going to be uniqlo but even uniglo doesn't really have it uniqlo has regular fitting t-shirts they don't sell wash tees right and if they do sell it boxy they always cut the they cut the sides looking like an elongated t-shirt from like 2017 i'm not a big fan of that or if they have a boxing fitting t-shirt they'll have a cigarette pocket and i don't like i don't i'm not i don't need a cigarette pocket um i don't smoke cigarettes okay i don't i don't need it i'm not gonna put anything in there i think it's pointless uh and i think it ruins the t-shirt i just want a blank t-shirt what's so hard about that right i can't name any other store i can go to that potentially would have what i'm looking for other than online so i have to sit here going through the measurements and all this kind of stuff so closing this out thank you so much for tuning in make sure you guys and girls keep it locked from clothing music to culture it is your boy keezy and i will see you next time peace", "udXr_8sQfg0": "[Music] thank you so much for stopping by and welcome in this video I am going to be showing you how i sublimate on a t-shirt using cricut design space I've had this printer for about a month now and using inkjet this ink on the supplement paper and their tech support they walk me through step by step how to convert this printer into a sublimation printer if you're looking to get into sublimation I really highly recommend going through inkjet bits if you have questions on how to turn a printer into a sublimation as they they walk me through everything with without a problem because I was actually afraid to do it on my own so if you're looking to turn your machine into a sublimation printer I highly recommend order them from them I will leave all the links below without further ado let's get into this video [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]", "t1UyJYES1J8": "hey guys welcome back to my channel\ntoday's video I am super excited about I'm going to be showing you how to make\nsome custom print t-shirts so anything you can think of you want on a t-shirt I'm\ngoing to show you how to do it without any transfer paper needed and I think\nthat's super cool so whether it's memes, quotes, whatever you like - you can put it\non a t-shirt and slay this is so inexpensive and absolutely in love with\nhow it turned out so in case you want to print your own t-shirts without any\ntransfer paper just grab anything you want and let's get started!\nActually no, I'm going to show you what you need for this DIY. So you're going\nto need your t-shirts, some cling film, some parchment paper - which is usually\nused for cooking or baking but we're going to use it for printing today. A\npair of scissors, an iron box and obviously your prints. You need to have\nprints because this is what you're essentially sticking onto your t-shirts.\nSo for my prints I just typed 'aesthetic' pictures and chose the ones I loved and\nonce you have a selection of prints just cut off the white bit because\nyou're not going to be needing it I printed this off on normal paper so no\nspecial paper is needed for this at all once everything was nice and cut, I had a\ncouple of prints to choose from which actually took about five hours to choose\nwhich prints I wanted to use - that is not the point of this video but now I'm\ngoing to show you what went wrong the first time I did this. So I followed all\nthe steps and when it came to ironing my prints down, I ironed away. I took my\ntime, I was not rushing this at all but when it came to lifting off the\nparchment, 'they ask you how you are and you just have to say that you're fine and you're\nnot really fine and you just can't get into it because they would never understand so now I'm going to show you what\nexactly to do to make sure your print sticks onto your t-shirt and you have a\nfire t-shirt in your hands. So all I'm doing is I chose a print I liked and I\nwanted to stick onto my t-shirts this is the second one obviously the first one\nbackfired and all I'm doing now is I'm wrapping the print in some cling film.\nOne mistake I did in the previous attempt is I only wrapped part of the\nprint in some cling film you're supposed to wrap the entire thing because\nessentially what you're going to do is melt the plastic onto the t-shirt and\nthis is what makes the print stick properly so make sure you cover this bad\nboy from all angles possible so if your wrapping paper is not sufficient on the\nback just add some like I'm doing and you will be good to go. Cut off any\nexcess, you also don't want any lumpy bits when you're ironing it down that\nway there's no bumps on the back of your print and once everything is nice and\nwrapped you're going to position your print exactly where you want it, take\nsome parchment paper and iron your prints down. So what I did in this\nsituation is I started with moderate heat and then ironed it a bit,\nmake sure you focus on the edges that way it really sticks down and then I\nturned my iron to the highest setting and started ironing. This in turn burnt\nmy parchment paper a bit but it's completely okay because the marks do not\ntransfer onto the t-shirt so just be careful and make sure you're doing this\nas you lift your iron up that way the t-shirt does not get burnt but this is\nwhat burns the plastic and melts it onto your t-shirt and this makes the print\nstick so I do recommend doing this instead but just make sure you're super\ncareful that way you don't destroy your t-shirts once everything was nice and\nironed, I took out my parchment paper and my print was stuck on I celebrated\nat this point and I really love how this turned out and this is the final result.\nOne advice to you guys if you're going to wash this, make sure you do not wash\nit in the machine, hand wash this and air dry it because the machine is going to\ndestroy the print. So yeah, this is my first t-shirt. I love it. It says 'captured\nbecause one day they'll all be memories again' and I also did this with a pink\nt-shirt and I just used the 'Good Times' print. I love how vintage-y and aesthetic\nthese prints are and I just love how this two t-shirts turned out. Anyway, that is it\nfrom me today thank you so much for watching let me know how many t-shirts\nyou're going to be making... I recommend a thousand so yeah! Get to it right now. I\nreally hope you enjoyed watching this video and I'll hopefully catch you in my\nnext one but until then - agressively make meme t-shirts, I am with you on this! Love\nyou guys, see you soon. Bye!", "ylepXks8Ti8": "what's going on YouTube welcome back to the video blog one more time dogs and friends right gang real quick video in this one got some Gucci stuff in one's room once fake which one do you think it is I'm gonna give you a real quick look into these items so that you can kind of decide make a decision and then we're going to look and see how we can tell which one is the fake and which one is the real okay listen check [Music] [Music] right guys that's it you've had a look at way for the t-shirts which one do you think is real which one do you think is fake not going to keep you guys in suspense for any longer the one which is the fake one is actually this one right here this is the fake right here this is the fake Gucci t-shirt which I actually got from eBay wait for it guess how much I paid a hundred quid oh listen I want to repeat that 100 quid for this fake right here now the funny thing about this fake is the guy that was filling it was had 12 he has 12 items and he sold every single one for a hundred quid but let me just get into it let me just show you guys exactly how you can tell these two items are fake okay what first things first if we look at this Gucci label that you can see on the neck now what get you've gone and done it they've gone impor here on the neck and you can see the red stitching it goes across guys okay it goes across it's quite straight it's a straight line across if you look at the fake one they've put it in a diagonal line to the side okay that's the first thing that I would notice you would always see Gucci do it in a straight line if you look at the stitch print you can see that it's going across like that okay you can see the little kind of grooves and the lines going across and if you look at the fake one you can see there are lines going across in one direction but if you hold it this way you can also see there's little kind of slight lines going across in the other direction as well I know that's really going to be quite difficult to spot but just to look carefully at the Gucci just look carefully at the Gucci you can see that it's only going one way these little faint lines in the background it's going down look at this one again you can see it looks like it's going in multiple directions not only just down okay also if you look at the main Italy tag you can see it's in black it should actually be in white in the background and the writing is in black okay it shouldn't be all black like that the next thing is if you look at the actual Gucci logo to the front itself this is actually meant to be like a vintage inspired top so they've actually got an affair get out the colors here people on the Instagram they looked at this one because the print of the fake one seemed a lot more clearer than the original a lot of people thought this was the genuine one if we look at it the the print is just too bright man the colors too bright okay should beat up right should be a little bit faded so if you're looking at some Gucci shirts and you're seeing that it's really bright and it reads out then that's incorrect guys okay the whole print even the gold bit it's it's a little bit faded okay the other thing to notice as well is that on the screen print at the use for the t-shirt you can see that the print itself is just too thick okay is too thick it shouldn't be that thick look at the size of the real are look at the size of the fake are totally different if we look at the size of the Gucci logo you can see that it's a little bit smaller than the original okay it shouldn't be as big as this it's a little bit smaller if you don't have a genuine one next to it it's going to be really difficult to tell so that might be a tough one another quick way to look at is to simply look at the labels inside if you look at the label as you can see there's lots of information it's a nice long slim tag it says Made in Italy right there and we've got lots of information now this is a three hundred and forty pound shirt and I'm a little bit disappointed that Gucci haven't taken time out to put them all off indication labels especially now that Gucci has got a lot bigger over the years so obviously there's going to be more counterfeit especially around the Christmas time and why haven't DG implemented 30 logo or a hologram or something to help their fan base identify that the items are genuine because remember what if you have a duty top and you want to sell it and you have to receipt anymore or something like that you know this should be something on this garment that can help the second-hand market which I feel is a bit of a letdown brands like Gucci that haven't taken precautions to protect their items fully and to be honest with you it's the pre-owned clothing market that's really messing up these brands with the counterfeit so you should really be looking into stuff like that you can see there the tags are completely different really really lazy tag on the fake it says they're made in Italy by it's not it's it's made in China they even try it long tag and on the side there similar to what like Montclair have a little kind of small slim label and it's got the size large there so here they've actually attached the size label on to the label itself and it's it's it's in black so it's in the wrong color okay this very much looks like an old Gucci tag to me doesn't like one of the new ones this is the new Gucci tag right here so you can see it's a lot more slick but more modern-looking compared to the fake label I mean to be honest it's a really plain t-shirt so there's not too much else to differentiate between this two I mean what I would say is that this cotton hair is a really really nice feeling cotton it's so nice and even look at it you can see it's almost like a little bit opaque and a little bit see-through but it's got a really nice feel to it I would give it that I mean 440 it's got to have something that really kind of stands out is it where free fully hell to the no but there you go some people are going to end up you know that's that shirt right there is more or less sold out in most places now you you know really see me running around and design a t-shirt too tough to be honest with you it's not really my thing that's it going on out there lots to do so yeah hope you enjoyed it like subscribe share with a good stuff yeah peace out [Music]", "zQDyu7O9O5g": "hi there this is mo of MO West creations today I'm going to show you how to cut up shirts like Adam Sachs from ed hardy the first thing that almost always has to go is the collar so we're going to cut that off and remember you can always cut more but you can't cut less so just cut right on the other side of that seam holding the collar on and stretching is another thing that we're really going to be doing a lot of the next thing we're going to do is decide where we want our cuts so we're going to take some right down the middle here in order to do that if it's not on someone and you can't just see where the middle is we're going to fold it in half and line up your shoulder seams and your side seams if you have them if you don't just line up your arm holes and your shoulder seams and try and get your shirt nice and smooth like so then it's all about cutting little stripes into your shirt in any shape you want so we're going to go strip strip right down the front about the same width until we get under the bust then we're going to make them a little wider so we don't mind showing the belly a little bit you want to keep them about the same distance apart but you can just make them deeper cuts again you can always cut more but you can't cut less also want to cut off the bottom of the shirt and then we're going to stretch so now I'm going to show you basic weave stitch for t-shirts so you want to take reach underneath your first one pull up your second one and then pull it over so that you can pull the third one up through the second one and down then grab your fourth one up through their third one and just carry on like that it's very simple all the way making sure you don't skip any just reach your fingers through grab the next one pull it up carry it on all the way once you start getting towards the end whether that's the top or the bottom what you're going to do is bring your last one through you can either cut it off and tie it to itself around each side or get another strip of fabric from somewhere else on the t-shirt like along the bottom stretch that out which will make it much longer and loop it through there and then this is going to tie around behind the neck and to do that we can make a little hole in the back here for now we'll probably put another weave in the back and then this can attach to the top of that one and it will be glorious but in the meantime we will just tie it around to the back this has been mo of mo West creations ciao Hey", "ZKKdTDDUaY8": "Hi, I'm

[Applause] [Music] you", "3UmS2zWXrLc": "hey guys this team of style I'm Jose Zuniga and for this week's video we're going to be talking all about t-shirts so like you guys have been pointing out in the comment section I've been wearing a lot of t-shirts lately and that's for a specific reason I've been test driving a lot of brands lately trying to find the perfect t-shirt for you guys then for myself as well now I already know where you're going to say but Jose you told us not to wear t-shirts like three years ago and you're right however my feelings towards t-shirts have drastically changed I feel that a good t-shirt that fits really well can be a suitable casual option for men especially in hot humid summer heat one of the biggest reasons why I didn't like t-shirts was the fact that they shrunk so easily here's a prime example this is an H&M t-shirt that I bought literally less than six months ago honestly after three washes the t-shirt was already two sizes too small and this is what I did it light I have a drawer full of about five to ten hmmm t-shirts that I just don't use because they're two sizes too small and why I love their six dollar price point I don't love that I have to be buying new ones every four wears or whatever it may be so the reason why you've been seeing t-shirts so much lately is because I've been test driving t-shirts trying to find the perfect t-shirt under two categories one quality I wanted a t-shirt that's so well-made that it's not going to shrink after one or two washes but instead fit great always and then the second one was that fit a t-shirt that actually fit well and stayed with that proper fit for multiple wear so I wasn't looking for disposability I was looking for quality t-shirts that look good and feel good and I've never in my search to three brand recommendations for you guys and some of the best t-shirts out there for men and there are multiple price points and I did that purposely my three recommendations are going to be Tanny trim menswear and black socks also in that order of price point so let's start with tani tani is going to be my high-end recommendation of the three I'm going to be talking about the reason why tani is that the high-end one is because their t-shirts can retail anything from 65 to 145 yes I said $145 for a single t-shirt so this is definitely for the guy that's comfortable paying that amount and why it is the high-end option you also must understand those that you're getting the best of the best there is when you invest into tanning the owner was nice enough to send over a discount Konan if you use TMF 25 you'll get 25% off your order which is a hefty discount considering the price point of these t-shirts the t-shirts you're seeing right now are they're lower priced t-shirts at $65 the great thing about tanning t-shirts is that they feature a moisture wicking fabric called micro motor air fabric all their shirts are made in Europe with natural materials the fabric itself is super lining cool it's actually softer and thinner than silk giving the user a remarkably comfortable and soft feel these two models you're seeing have been washed twice already and as you can see their Fit is still excellent and I really didn't experience any shrinkage with these two t-shirts most in part because these t-shirts features 6% elastane and their shirts that really helps for the shirt to return back to its original shape and that shrink or stretch out which are two things you don't want in a t-shirt next up we have trim menswear trim menswear as a handcrafted brand that's tratar 'get it for the athletic man so if you have an athletic build this brand might suit you best it's also it also Falls second on my list because it's it falls right in the middle price point wise at around $45 at t-shirt given that I usually recommend this shirt more to the Henri crowds a high earner not rich yet and of course we snag the discount code for this brand as well and if you use TMF trim 20 you'll get 20% off what I love about these t-shirts is their design and fit for around $45 you're getting a luxurious model supima cotton fabric that is natural and breathable the deep crewneck design is a refreshing twist from the various deep v-necks I already own as for the fit the t-shirt fits perfectly in all the right places I mean look at it it has a nice and snug fit around the chest and region area however it doesn't pull or constrict that it looks like I'm wearing a t-shirt that's a size too small it also has a relaxed fit through the midsection so this really adds to the breathability and the coolness of the t-shirt which makes it perfect for summer I washed both of these t-shirts you saw the both the black and the white one before this video and as you can see they're fit and quality is still on point which is the reason why they made the cut for this video and finally we have black socks black socks for Falls last on our list because it is the lowest priced model of those three we're going to be talking about this is for the guy that still wants that quality t-shirt but doesn't want to break the bank especially on a college budget black socks produces two shirts I really like their deep V Claudette model which retails around 125 dollars and their regular v-neck Suzette model which retails for around $23 and of course the good news is since you're a viewer you can use code TMF ten off and you'll get 10% off oh and then I mentioned they also have free worldwide shipping so it's really a great price point and great value the great thing with black socks is that the t-shirts even at this unbelievable low price point you're getting amazing high quality pima cotton that is naturally breathable in a fit that is perfection what I really like about the shirt though is that it also has that 5% elastane and I usually like this in shirts for two reasons it really helps make the shirt more resilient so this helps it keep its original shape even after several wear so it doesn't matter how many times you wash it the shirt always bounces back to its original shape I also like it because it hugs the arm area a little bit closer this helps gives the illusion I'm having fuller arms than you really do which almost all of us need a little help in that area when we can get it so that's it for this week's video guys I hope you enjoyed it I'll have the link down below all the t-shirts I spoke about in the order that I did with their corresponding discount code if you're interested in any of the t-shirts I spoke about so I hope you enjoyed this video if you did remember to hit up the like up I'm also let me know what you think down below which tee shirt was your favorite that's it for me for this week's

using the font called lipstick lettering this looks like it is a Cricut font so I always get asked what font is it where do I get the font so this font is lipstick lettering and it is from Cricut so the shirt I'm gonna make is going to say mom life not for me I am NOT a mom I'm making this for my sister-in-law so um so if you're new to my channel she has a set of twins and eight now 10 year old so she deserves this out of anybody so we have our text here so now with a script font like this where the letters should be touching together we want to make all of these letters touch together so there's two ways you can do this one is to just decrease the letters spacing like this so now they're touching or you can ungroup the entire set of text by clicking ungroup over here so if you didn't see that so you just select the text and click ungroup and now you can move the letters to where you want it both ways work fine it's just personal preference if you have like a ton of text sometimes it's a little bit easier to undelete it yourself but completely up to you so I'm just gonna move this a little bit and then I'm just gonna have this heart go right underneath it so no real right or wrong way to do this just kind of wherever I kind of like it a little off-center so that is basically our design that's pretty much it so now that we have our design how we want it and actually I will say too this is not my idea this is a shirt that she found online that she liked so I am kind of doing the version of it so just wanted to throw that out there so now that we have our design how we want it we want to make this all one chunk of text so it all cuts out together in this how it's organized here on the mat so what we can't sameen all right so um why does this look this mom looks smaller than the rest of the text so I'm just gonna make it there we go so what we want to do is we want to use our weld function down here and basically that's gonna weld everything together so it all cuts out as one chunk so nothing is loose like it is right now so to do that all you need to do is click and just how I like to do is I just highlight everything so now all of our text our heart everything is selected so now our weld button over here is lit up so we're just going to hit weld and so now it's one big chunk of text super-easy see so this is basically it does all we have to do for our shirt so now we're gonna go over to make it and most important when doing a t-shirt or using heat transfer vinyl or HTV or some kind of iron-on you need to mirror your image so all you need to do to do that is click this little mirror button over here and turn it on and so basically you can see it's gonna make your design mirrored or backwards and that's because when we apply it to the shirt we're gonna be flipping it over so we're gonna be pressing it you know right-side up so it's hard to explain but I will I will walk you through it once I switch you guys to the camera so it's much easier than it sounds but the bottom line is make sure you mirror your text or your image it's going to look backwards but that is what we want okay now that I have scolded you all no I'm just kidding now we can move on to actually making it so we just hit continue it's gonna find our machine and then we will choose our settings okay so the material that we are gonna use is the everyday iron on here and I know you guys can probably see I changed my so the mom life is gonna be in green and then the heart is gonna be in black I had a conversation with my sister-in-law as I was doing this and she wanted green and black so we're good to go so now you can see it's telling us make sure mirror is turned on and the iron on material is faced shiny side down on the mat so I'll switch you guys over to the camera so you can see how exactly we are going to do that okay so first we are gonna cut our green and so I'm gonna use my light grip blue mat for this it is cool white dirty so we want to make sure we so you can see that the HTV has this really shiny side and then there's like this matte dull side so we want to make sure we put the shiny side face down so the matte side is face up that is because the shiny side that is like the carrier sheet and so that's why we had to mirror our design so basically it's gonna get cut out backwards out of this and then we're gonna flip it over and that's how we press it so it sits so like this dull side that's the side that's gonna get pressed down to the t-shirt so we keep oh my god sorry guys so we can pull out our machine so we have our HTV scrape down relatively well it's not perfect so now we can load our mat and we know that our mat is ready to be loaded when this is blinking so we'll load our mat and we can cut I really should get a new mat I just I'm so lazy you guys as long as it gets cut up here we'll be fine cuz down here is not gonna matter I just always cut in excess just in case okay so while I unload this I just grabbed my heat press I'm gonna turn it on and get that warmed up all right so we can unload our mat you can set this aside for now so now I'm going to cut out the heart on this black HTV so same thing we're gonna make sure we put these shiny side down on our mat load our mat and we can cut and that one should take no time at all so while that is cutting I'm just gonna cut out the text and so now this excess stuff I can just put it in my archive save it for later all right so we're done with our machine so now fun part or one of my favorite parts is we get to lead this and I love weeding HTV because it is so easy so this is sizer Caesar I have no idea how to pronounce it easy weed so I'll light and if you have a weeding tool you can use that I just have my scissor or my tweezers because I have no idea where my weeding tool is but I like to just pull up a corner and just start pulling so we're gonna be pulling away the negative space so we're left with the actual text all right so now we'll weed out the Middle's of the letters okay so we have our mom life and now I'm just going to cut out the heart and again same thing I'm just gonna pull up a corner and just pull away alright so we have our heart we have our text so I'm gonna clean up my scraps and the heat press is ready to go and so we will start pressing okay so we are ready to press our shirt so a couple of things one I know this is a little wrinkled don't come for me you know it's a little bit wrinkled but everything's gonna be fine I just took it out of the package well you know make sure it's presentable for her um secondly you want to make sure you spread it out as flat as possible and you do not press any of the seams or if there's like a fold underneath or if some of the material is kind of like bunched up underneath you want to make sure that you completely flatten the surface that you're going to press the reason is is because I've experienced like if I press a seam for some reason it like burnt it tends to burn the seam or just just I don't know it looked and gives it a weird look so just try and get as flat as possible now for placement I know there's a lot of likes you know kind of like charts out there that say like two inches from the collar or whatever and I tend to kind of stick to that but also I kind of just eyeball it and see what I kind of like so I just kind of place it where I think it's going to look the best so that is not good advice but that's how I do it so I'm going to do something like this and then I'll put the heart underneath once I get this mom life pressed first and what I also like to do to see if it's like relatively centered as I'll just do a quick kind of measurement so that's about 4 and a quarter and that's about four and a half so I can probably move it over just a hair so that's about four and a quarter and that's pretty close to four and a quarter so this the L the tallest part is about two inches from the collar so I think that looks pretty good and then we'll do the heart just like right down here so it'll look cute okay so now that we have everything placed where we want it I like to put a piece of parchment paper or Teflon over it just to protect mostly to protect the shirt just to make sure I don't burn it and I'm going to be using my easy press today so I'm gonna be pressing at 305 degrees for about 50 I'll start it off about 15 seconds and then if we need to press it more we will you can a hundred percent do this with an iron yes you could do this with an iron I've done many shirts with an iron before so if you are doing it with an iron you're just gonna want to make sure it's on its hottest setting you turn off the seam completely and you've given a lot of pressure Capisce okay so I'm gonna be using my heat press so it is ready to go we're ready to press so I'm just gonna bring it over and I'm going to set it down and give it good pressure set the timer for about 15 seconds and then I'll lift it up so I'm pressing it down giving it good pressure all right lift it up and we'll know if we pressed it hard enough if this just comes off super easy which it does yay and you can also know you can also tell if it's pressed enough because if you look at it you won't be able to see it but you can see like the fibers in the shirt so that's another way to see if you've pressed it hard enough okay so we have that so now we're gonna press the heart I kind of like it off-center so I hope she does too all right so I'm just gonna press the heart and I'm gonna put this back over just to protect that each TV just so I don't melt it so I'm gonna put my Teflon or parchment back on and I'm gonna give this one more press for 15 seconds and I'm gonna focus most of my pressure on the heart I mean that's kind of hard to do but you know everything's gonna get really nicely pressed all right so now we can unpin from there and unpeel from here and so we have our super cute shirt alright guys so that is it for our super cute mom life shirt I hope she likes it and if she doesn't she's lucky because I love her and I'll do it for her again but anyways I hope this helped you if you have

about nailing the fit whether it is your t-shirt or any other men's wear item but your boy has officially converted right i have officially joined the dark side what is up my friends welcome back to your average gents it's your boy evan you know i have been trying out these oversized t-shirts recently and dang i have to say i kind of love it but styling oversized t-shirts can be tricky right if it is too big then you risk looking like you're wearing a dress but if it is not big enough if it is not oversized enough the look won't work so in today's video i'm gonna be giving you the seven tips to rock that oversized look with confidence and style and if that sounds interesting without further ado let's begin oversized style tip number one and that is you gotta look for the right cutting rocking that oversized look it's not just about buying a t-shirt that is two sizes too big i'm talking about t-shirt that has a specific cutting it has to have a very relaxed and boxy fit a boxy fits t-shirt will have a wider torso and longer sleeves let me show you right this right here is a boxy fit bigger torso and longer sleeves if you just got your regular t-shirt and even worse if you got a slim fit t-shirt then you just look like you just accidentally bought a t-shirt that is two sizes too big okay the second tip to rock that oversized look is to make sure that when you put it on the shoulder area drops down check it out right my shoulder ends around here but the shoulder of the sleeves is lower this drop shoulder look interestingly enough gives the illusion that your shoulders are broader which is a plus because who doesn't want to look like they have broader shoulders and if the shoulder of the t-shirt aligns with your shoulder then the t-shirt is not big enough and you need to size up okay the third tip to rock that oversized look it's all about the sleeves length to rock that oversized look your sleeves need to at least hit your elbow and it should cover the hole of your upper arm if it is shorter it shows a bit of your biceps and triceps the oversized sleeve it's gonna make your arms look super small and of course obviously the sleeves shouldn't drop all the way to your forearms the perfect length of an oversized t-shirt is at your elbows all right on to number four and that is you have to take note that when you rock this look you're not going for the muscular look your goal is not to look muscular right because all your gains are all hiding underneath that extra fabric this look is for you to look more laid back and relaxed this is definitely not the t-shirt you want to wear if you want to look more mature this kind of look just shouts youthfulness and the total disregard for the classic fit so i wouldn't recommend the oversized look for anyone over 30 or 35 years old and i probably will not be able to rock this look a few years down the road okay on to tip number five and that is to keep the t-shirt simple the t-shirts shouldn't be too loud it shouldn't have super loud colors or graphics on it because the oversized t-shirt and the oversized look is already loud enough it is already an attention grabber on its own so i like to keep it plain and simple you know like your blacks your whites and your pastel colors any bold colors or patterns or graphics will just make this look even louder so i will just stick to the neutral colors and just let the oversized look be the statements all right the sixth tip to rock that oversized look is to keep your bottom slim if you're wearing an oversized top you don't want to wear an oversized bottom as well because that will just make you look like you're wearing pajamas right instead go with a pair of slim or skinny jeans the slimness of the bottom balances out the bagginess off the top making the oversized t-shirt more of an intentional choice rather than a mistake so baggy on top and slim below plus by wearing a skinny or a slim fit jeans at the bottom it's gonna give you the desirable v-shaped taper and who doesn't want that last but not least tip number seven and that is to know that this oversized look is always casual so it looks the best with some shorts some jeans or some joggers you could wrap them with some cropped trousers if you wanna and for footwear definitely go with sneakers finally yes oversized t-shirt is in trend right now it is super hipster it's super cool but a well fitted classic t-shirt is still here to stay because it will always be classic and always be timeless but hey if you want to jump on to the hipster bandwagon if you're young and youthful go ahead and try out some oversized t-shirts and who knows you may even fall in love with them like i do and that is basically it for today's video if you found this video helpful make

video bam [Music]", "iEQsTaa8mME": "[Music] hey guys it's Dana from made everyday calm today I'm going to show you how to easily dye fabric from a white color to a really fun color at your house in a bowl without a lot of fuss [Music] guy in fabrics is really fun and I think sometimes there's a misconception that it is super messy and complicated and it ruins your washing machine I don't even do to my washing machine I love to do it in a bowl in my kitchen it's really easy and it's kind of an adventure every single time it turns out slightly different and I love doing them on these little baby onesies because it doesn't take much fabric they're super fun cute great to give as a baby gift and sometimes for girls and for boys it's hard to find that perfect shade you want I mean this cool teal or a fun gray color you have lots of choices you can also dyed fabric you could dye elastic all sorts of things that might need just a little bit of sprucing up with a fun shade so here's what you need some white fabric or a garment fabric dyes a bit of salt a mixing bowl and spoon and some gloves stopper guy comes in a lot of different shades and then a few different types I purchase these at my local jo-ann fabric and craft store and I love the variety that they have there I'm using the RIT die today that is in liquid form which makes it really easy to just mix with your water and this is best used on cotton type fabrics now Joanna also carries this other kind made by RIT and it's meant for synthetic fabrics that's something that you want to be aware of if you're dying say some elastic that has some polyester in it or something like that which I have died elastic before it's super fun if you're making a cute circle skirt and you want an orange last book or some other color now you can also buy dye in the powder form I prefer to liquid a little bit better just because it mixes really well but if you want to use the powder that is fine I would recommend mixing the powder in a small amount of water first before you put it in your large die back that you're doing okay so let's get to it now typically I would dye fabric in my kitchen in a bowl in the sink but for now in my studio I have a plastic bag protecting my table and going to put on some gloves here to protect my hands which is really important because you don't want to end up with crazy-looking fingers later there we go now you want to get some really hot water pour it into your bowl and if you're just doing one one onesie or a piece of fabric you don't need a lot of liquids so that picture was just enough then going to take your garment and these onesies I also got it Johanna I love that they carry that there they also carry t-shirts which makes it easy to just pick up everything at once now you want to get your fabric wet first I'm just going to put it right here in the water and that's important so that when you put the dye in it absorbs everything evenly and then you also want to end button this so that everything can just flow through both parts of the onesies or your fabric or whatever you're doing okay it looks like it's saturated an F and wring this out take it back out next thing you want to do is add some salt now you want to read the instructions on your dye packet and it will tell you some of these details how much salt - add per pound of fabric etc etc I don't know how much this weighs I'm just doing one thing so like I said this is an adventure every time that I do it but I think that's kind of fun so I'm just adding some amount of salt and to be honest I don't always know how much good this does but hey salts cheap if it says to add it I'm going to ask okay that looks good mix that up okay that's pretty good and then comes the fun part adding ends die I'm going to do yellow because yellow of my favorite color oh I forgot I need to shake it first okay now we can pour them here we go for low roof your bowl doesn't splash up on you and that's pretty good the amount that you put in again will vary how dark you want it how light you want it but I think it's better to err on the side of adding more dye limited idiom it's better to buy a lighter fabric dye and leave your garment in for longer than to buy a dark fabric dye and leave them for shorter if that makes sense because they will evenly distribute better the longer that you leave in the dye okay mix it up really well and then kind of magic okay we're ready to put our little piece of fabric in here here goes all the way down in okay there you go oh okay but that's not going to be long enough you want to leave it in here and now I'm taking my hands and I'm just kind of rubbing it all around and pushing it all around and kind of fun it's kind of like massaging a little piece of fabric swirl it around the instructions on your container will tell you to stir it constantly for a certain amount of time I don't always do that again I'm a little experimental with this stuff I like to just mix it around for a while and then sometimes I'll walk away and you know go load the dishwasher we'll put kids to bed whatever are the bazillion things that you're doing at home with your kids as a mom then I come back and I stir it again and then I walk away while and I come back sometimes I do these for about 15 minutes you can do them for longer you can do them for less but like I said it's better if it's in four I know probably at least five to ten minutes than just one minute and I think it will do all sorts of fun stuff like you can get an hombre effect if you put it let's see yes put it all the way in and then put in a little bit more and then put it it kind of takes a while but it's kind of cool also okay so we're going to let this sit for a little bit and I'll stir it off and on okay this has been sitting for about 15 minutes and I think it looks like a great shade something else that is kind of fun with these is that like I said this is for cotton fabric this type of diet and sometimes the thread is a more of a synthetic fabric so it doesn't die and stays white or the little tag I think it's kind of cute fun element okay now keep in mind that whatever shade you see here it's going to be slightly darker than it will look after rinsing it and after washing it so if you start rinsing and you feel like it looks too light well just stick it back in and then do it for a little bit longer that is the fun thing about dyeing fabric and since I only have a little bit I could still use this a bunch more time okay I'm rinsing this out into my bowl now I'm going to take it to the sink and rinse it with some water I'm just prints in here with some hot water and you just want to do this for I don't know a few minutes you just keep filling it with water wringing it out you just want to do it until you see that there is no more dye coming out into your sink I like to open this up make sure it's going through the inside times you can hold on to the bottom or it's also nice if you have one of these kind of things to bring it down just kind of really get the water in there this yellow is a really pretty color and I love how it works great for boys or girls [Music] okay so when you ring it out and the water is clear which it looks like it is now then you're done now I'm just going to lay this here for a second while I go make sure my washing machine is ready for watching okay our fabric is ready to be washed and I like to just throw it in the washing machine with other things that are similar colors that need to be washed I always make sure I put I want to do the color catcher sheets and if you were giving this to someone as a gift you might include a couple sheets and just mention to them this is in hand dyed and they might want to use those the first few times okay let's stick it in and then we'll see how it looks and here we go there's the finished product washed and dried and that is such a beautiful shade I love this I don't think you could find a premade one be like this in the store that is the fun thing about Dyne your own fabric you can decide what you want okay now if you were given this as a baby gift I would recommend adding some other items to it like a baby circle skirt in confetti fabric yeah maybe a bib to go with that most certainly or if you have a little boy it's beautiful minty turquoisey onesies with some little baby leggings and a little pom-pom hat wrap it on up and your gifts are ready to go so go grab a bottle of fabric dye and have fun on your adventure is to die for too much too much for more ideas and tutorials visit my website made every day calm and for all of your fabric dye craft and fabric needs head to your local jo-ann store or visit jo-ann calm I'll see you next time bye [Music]", "Rw-rseVKSSg": "T-Shirt Folding HACKS Fold Shirt In Under\n3 Seconds 4 Ways To Fold Tee's [0:00:00]\nThe t-shirt, a classic item in every man\u2019s wardrobe, but how to properly store your t-shirts\nbetween wears? Well, it turns out there are actually at least\nfour ways to properly store and fold your t-shirts. In today\u2019s video, I\u2019m going to teach you\nall four methods including a trick to fold a t-shirt in less than three seconds. Method number one. The basic fold. This is the simple method that most people\ndefault to. Lay the t-shirt out flat face down, fold the\nshirt in half from left to right. Then, fold the sleeves in towards the middle. Now, fold the shirt in half from top to bottom. You can either stop here or fold it in half\nagain to take up a little bit less room. The advantage of this method is it\u2019s simple,\nit\u2019s well-known, and it\u2019s equally useful for storage or travel. The main disadvantage is you\u2019re likely to\nhave some wrinkles and creases develop where you folded the shirt. The second method is known as the marine roll\nalso called the army roll, but, hey, I\u2019m a marine here. It\u2019s popular in the military for its efficient\nuse of space. Lay the shirt out flat face up and then fold\nthe bottom of the shirt up three to four inches. Smooth out the fabric to minimize wrinkles,\nthen fold the shirt into thirds, start on the left side folding it over the center,\nthen take the left sleeve and fold it back over the center. You\u2019ll now do the same with the right side\nbring it over before folding the right sleeve back to the center. Now, you\u2019re ready to start rolling. Start at the collar making sure you keep the\nroll nice and tight. Once you get to the end, you\u2019ll undo the\nfold you created at the bottom of the shirt and tuck it over each end of the roll to keep\nit in place. This roll takes up very little space, so it\u2019s\nperfect for small storage spaces or you\u2019re traveling light with a small suitcase. The disadvantage of the marine roll is it\ntakes more time than all the other methods. Method three. The hanger. The third method doesn\u2019t require any folding\nor rolling, you\u2019re simply going to put your shirt on a hanger and place it in your closet. Make sure though that you use plastic hangers\nfor this. Wire hangers can cause the dreaded nipple\neffect which isn\u2019t a great look and you don\u2019t want basically to have to throw your\nshirts into the dryer or launder them again so that the cotton goes back to its original\nshape. The main advantage to using the hanger method\nis you\u2019re going to avoid the creases and wrinkles that are sometimes caused by folding. In addition, if you\u2019ve got a closet with\na lot of space, this may be a great place to put it versus into a dresser drawer. The disadvantage of the hanger method is if\nyou have a small closet, it\u2019s going to end up taking a lot of space especially if you\nhave a lot of t-shirts. And if you travel quite a bit, you\u2019re going\nto have to take the shirts off the hangers and then fold them. Method number four and my favorite, the two-second\nfold. So, this final method creates a great-looking\nfold so fast it\u2019s practically magic. Lay the shirt out flat, smoothing it out to\nremove any wrinkles. You\u2019re going to imagine two lines; one that\ngoes across the middle of the shirt, one that goes top to bottom between the collar and\nthe sleeve. Where the lines intersect is going to be point\nA, the top of the shirt is going to be point B, and the bottom of the shirt is point C.\nPinch point A with your left hand. Make sure to grab both the top and bottom\nlayer of the fabric. Pinch point B with your right hand, then bring\npoint B down to point C. You will now uncross your arms and lay the shirt face down on the\ntable. Use the table to fold the shirt until you\nhave an even amount of fabric on each side of the shirt. If you want, you can fold it again in the\nmiddle to take up a bit less space. With a bit of practice you can become lightning\nfast with this method. There is truly no faster way to fold a t-shirt. There you have it gentlemen, four effective\nways to fold and store your t-shirts. So, whenever you need them whenever you\u2019re\ntraveling, you\u2019ve got them ready to go.

"d3xLHFeX-JA": "I'm going to do a little video today on hand-washing which arm is a pain it's something we don't do very often because most of the clothes know do go in the machine occasionally you get a lovely jumper like this one here and it does say quite specifically cool hand wash and the reason it says that is because sometimes if he's sitting in the water in the washing machine for too long or if the water's too hot it shrinks the fibers and it's such a beautiful jumper these sometimes a bit worrying to pop it into the machine however today a lot of the machines do have settings on there for woolens and I do know that sometimes that works out quite well however my machine is quite old and my woolen set is 40 degrees and that would be too hot for it so just have a look my daughter's washing machines much better her woolen or hand wash setting is 30 degrees or 20 degrees that's better because you're saying hand hot because you don't want to be you can't put your handle it in it's not too hot so you know you're not going to shrink the fibers so if you do decide to take a chance on your washing machine have it on the lowest setting and the short is spin alright but if you decide you're going to give it a wash because this is brand new and I don't want to take any chances with the machine you're going to have your water Poppaea your dies or whatever it is if you use for everything you know soap powder years and as I say that's handful and then you're very gently you just sort of immerse that evening up and then you're just very conceiving soap coming out of that it's quite grubby because we keep leaving it because we can't be bothered to try and wash it and you're just very very gently just going to be almost squeezing the dirt out all right now don't leave it leave it in there at all just very gently you can see all that coming out there shows you how bad it is if you've got any little marks very very gently take the edge of your calf might be grubby just very gently but don't over rub it otherwise you're going to end up spoiling spawning your top or your jump or whatever it is and just round the neck sometimes gets a bit worse so now that's going to come out I'm just going to squeeze it okay and then I'm going to mix it so we have our water again it's not too hot otherwise at hand hog that's the key all right thing you're just going to gently squeeze out the soap powder big for the dirt coming out and we're going to take it out and then you're going to rinse it again you can see how dare tables mighty host and now we've got our water again hand temperature I'm just going to really very carefully just leave that out if you've any surface mucky water okay lastly you can see now I got water in hands yeah okay so just adding a little bit of conditioner just enough to soften it otherwise water makes it quite hard and we're going to say man altering and then just doing six really fabric conditioner okay now I'm just going to very gently squeeze actual and that lovely flavor which is going into jump and softening and making it less static addition so just know Jake you do that again don't leave it sitting on there it's absorbed that water that lovely fragrance so now I'm going to take it out I'm just going to slay them literally whatever you do don't ruin it because otherwise that is going to back up all the fibers and causing it to go crooked I'm just going to gently that water out right now this has got a lot of water in it now they do to stay in here on the instructions to lay it flat I've yet to find a way of learning that flattening and where to put it I mean in this day and age we've got our radiators you hang it up it's going to stretch you pop it on the radiator it's going to drip water everywhere what when you've got something that's so that's a lighter fabric yeah you can pop it on a hang drip-dry it is perfect to pop it out and garden all on the line or over the bath you can do that with this but just be very careful with anything like this because it will stretch okay and then you're going to lose that lovely shape what I do is I pop it in my washing machine on a very very short spin so I pop it in there and then close the door and then I've got a very low a short spin so I know that that's delicate and a short spin so I've set it out ready here and that's what I'm about to do now put it on a very short spin okay so it's how do a short spin it's still my love watering it's still quite heavy so what I wouldn't do i wouldn't recommend you get your clothes also peg it up because for stop you're going to get those awful pin marks in it and can you see the shape it's just going to be all out of shape so don't do that I wouldn't recommend either you drag it across because what's going to happen is this mark here is going to run through the back of the jumper make it look pretty awful some they say to lay it flat you could get yourself a towel or something that's lights and no color runs out of that into what you're drawing and you could dry it flat let me suggest how long is that going to take to dry I think that's pretty nightmare if you have only bought clothes and have many radiators what you could do is you could pan out your bar here and then hang it over so you don't get that Ridge running through it we will still want to stretch slightly so just be careful and I would hang if you were going to do that I'd put it serving it with kind of this so the way that this isn't too heavy bearing that's almost like you find the center of balance personally I'd rather pocket on the radiator that I've turned down with the stats if you've got radiators like this with the rich cross again I would put a towel across it till it softens these edges if you've got the edges with the round radio to the a radiator they're the best one so here's our radiators got a nice curve I've got a styling so I've turned it down it's not going to get a blasting heat on it you don't need too hot otherwise again you're going to damage the fibers you can't write like that alright but I personally be inclined to get as much of the weight off it as I can and I've been kind to dry it across like that and then just take the weight out of these arms by popping them up on the radiator and then turning it over so I hope that it's of some use to you we've got some amazing clothes in this day and age and they cost a lot of money and sometimes they all just hand wash so very very good delicate on the washing machine the newer models of washing machines are gray you like mean you've got an old one that's the way around it so I hope it's been of some help to you so freely about our videos please tune in 2033 thank you", "s5klYyRPRJM": "hi guys welcome back to basic sales in white t-shirt perhaps the ultimate basic of all the basics you have five from country I am starting off with a soft pastel water eight dots here we go so this is six pound water bargain I put inside ten fits really well at the moment and like a queen size 8 I would say this if you went to a normal size would still have slightly oversized fit not skinny piecing things it's also not other sizes such just a really really good fit actually 100% cotton really simple t-shirt it's got quite a thin and oh what was the word not be you know like the rib section of book on the neckline the crewneck but then these are all crew neck by way all short sleeve so they're really really loose them all of these it's going to be a just comparison and but yes this is got quite thin rib section on the neckline just cast leads which really nice feeling that it's nice and soft six pounds definitely a real bargain I was Alan Price I have cheap that was because I would expect t-shirts from April through our twelve pound mark which is actually deprived of the next one on Liston X is 13 pounds the next week 13 pounds now I've got some brands I've never ever tried out here for the first of which sprung emails though I really want to try this out most people time in London now there is storage London I did also online now I live here or their photos online as articles because they'll also white t-shirt and imagine is pink and I've checked it when I really looked I was like well if it is pink but it can look like but it teaches me doing in a rush I may be shot in London if you're based in London the reason I want to transpile is because one size fits all which just blows my mind so I want to get that go to see how we can actually be one size fits all let's see how this gets on since 13 pounds I said and one size fits all it's also 100% courses and let's talk about the one size fits all aspect a lot at the end and and it's not basically how can that possibly be a thing this is a size eight I would say since I'm a tenor push put stretchy it would work outside but if I had to put aside on this side a friend Melville certain pounds one size fits all which I'm Anna looks at later okay absent respect system as well next up Larry has answered stories this one was sixteen seventeen pounds although hundred percent concert at European surface six a lot with it a little screen what size is I think that's a ten yeah I'm pretty sure that's a ten this is a really nice fit to it again I mean it's actually really similar to be able to on this one I think it has a length doesn't have a whips oh absolutely I it is super some resin sweet might be a tiny bit longer again it's not oversized fit such as quite pop see definitely not slim fitting just a reference I really like t-shirts uptick like that much when took them to my high-waisted jeans you know so that's what you've got see fat fries really luxury as not being the skin type I only mean but yet this long fits similarly to the a soft one definitely so I'm straw a 17-pound although the new percent Kaufman now there's one thing to know that is 100% cotton and literally only just found this out I've been looking online to get the information and more for me for not having checked the label on this and I want to say too much about this t-shirts brand because it will spoil the ending in this video but true American Vintage and the reason I'm mentioning and making such a big deal about this is because it has 10% angora in it which is a materials I will generally avoid in clothing and if not some hair ever ever seen a t-shirt and never accept my label I can see it doesn't feel like I understand coffee at all and I would never think for a second actually she'll come on Laura in it maybe that's completely clear from my part but yes and what does mention it because it isn't a material I know I don't know too much about it I know that the way they get that from the Aurora rabbit is a particularly cool message so it's not something that I ever want to promote on my youtube channel and have a check as I checked obviously before having the features this t-shirt however if you like everything I've done it and wearing it I've spent money on it and all of that so this is American Vintage 65 pounds and I think this is the size small and a tips that this goes temperature and Gorakhpur that are straight so I just want to mention that I didn't want to gloss over it or anything like that this one is actually off the other three really ice white and this is much more of a creamy sort of ivory white it's really really soft super soft has a very different fit to the others it doesn't have that boxing fit to it the necktie is a lot like the others the next line is sitting the heart this t-shirt is kind of it you're wearing that on the left hand stays quite flat for the net this one speaks a little bit more despite things to the crew neck style and but yes I would be featuring this had I known before hands I had angora right now I just want to make that really clear however this is American Vintage 55 pounds and disciple I've never ever happens on that branch wall and a little expensive one little different thing I'm gonna ask someone from something from its shop we done a mess but best knows that Levi's that they do they like we are we working digitally by and then sell one for an eye-watering price that between two and three hundred quid a thing most people have and they listen amazed I'm just not willing to spend that much on it their t-shirt completed silver at Ali watering 80-pound pretty seat for plain t-shirt I will have mesopause sir it's very small again it's slightly off-white that's interesting that both the most expensive ones are online is is definitely described as white though it's not staggered ivory or anything like that and this is the only one that has a top subscribe that she knows how to do sensitive you know some t-shirts have a like some C's texture of the cotton this is 100% cotton by the way this one again some species you can see the textures of cotton on and it's almost just let's just look like a texture that's where I can describe it this has that as please pretty short and then familias as well I don't know it's more like there and it fits really nicely and again it's got a nice met right everything like that slightly more fitted than some of the others ever so slightly and the storage want to animate this on a properly the box is - this is slightly more fitted so yes that was redone 80-pound extortionate for white t-shirt in a size small and so yeah I mean in a way because make week show you how stands up wash them all and then like nomads piles Ottomans I'm really excited for this one because she'll have white clean ships in a long time coming out I'm optimism Xena hey guys some t-shirt in the one in the eighth or flawed David Adams toys and skirt gives you lotuses and when don't can't label which I'm wearing which we are aware of that so if this is how that looked on and I really like the t-shirt things that are the high negative it just fit really nicely I think the sleeves are really good length it's good slightly oversized fit but still is really really flattering and it's just a really nice teacher that knows like whatsoever would definitely work again husband like scratching 20 anything's just felt like a nice simple t-shirt to throw on and we're really emitted it indefinitely by soberly and considering meso affordable of love I am impressed so far with this one house on the understory teachers that I am dead intellect miniskirt t-shirt laid the combat moment because the weather the movie night help with Topshop skirt my son calculator again top supplier to my hometown and yes really like what actually similarly to the a supply accomplished slightly prefer the longer sleeves on it when you've not got anything all over and I look a little bit better so probably just being the Air Force One and definite excuse me I've been having a few drinks I'm definitely better than the shop redone one shop Rita Wyndham shop working young money while Helen yesterday definitely better than that and spins really comfortable its soft it's in a hot day and it hasn't felt I've been hot question since the weather has been haven't made him feel hot and spicy and so yeah I'm impressed maybe it was a watched I do doubt it will see it never know take is probably well half their own tailor cameras and with writing and yeah and Japan the American institution on and thoroughly own impressed by it it's just something that anyway today I think it's really inspiring you can see here the way I have just got on a normal plunder proline bit waste on it and I personally don't worry you can see Lacey Jean bra oMG nipples a lot I think it looks kind of cool but this is just like to circle so unflattering everything the way the fabric hang right just just so incredibly unflattering is nothing absolutely nothing for you this comparison shop region one is where the top end absolutely we've done and but yeah it's just I really really have thoroughly autocratic so I have to say and it will be something at website because it's incredibly talked to bargain aside and very very soft I mean you can tell it's part by the way it's hanging but things like that able to want and the other stories one has also results that don't look disenfranchised so this is at least focused so far by a long way and really not that modern idea hi guys so I like an infinite should I make a path to put my hair up and then realized has got to the last day how long shot we do features day with mango means get very old hmm along my blaze that Topshop size and we're all turning and yeah I like it a lot the t-shirt has been I mean actually I don't like a lot of Jesus in size and comfy I like the way it looks actually had a lighter texture in there I think it looks quite nice and kind of hot sweaty today but again not necessarily on t-shirts well but it's no better and the under the stories one and the a source one I realizable that another day of combination please get along my blame is rather as unknown at least it's not self Kartik ways you can involving myself away from that but yes I like the t-shirt but not enough in comparison to a soft and of the stories to Warren spending that much more and so yeah spit hi you don't really smell approaching the t-shirt basically if you want to change little time I know come on the random l10 be be easy I also wore my Topshop checkered coat and my axes or a pump and pay them off and to Austin the globe but yet system is down so drinking tea a bit more properly as well and this t-shirt fine I'm going to talk about sizing of its Allsup's most interesting thing about Rhonda Melville at length others at the end of the video rather than now so it's fine but as an overview it's going to fit you absolutely fine if you are pretty much by waterside age I think what I'll talk about it more later on basically but yet it fits me with well I like it is comfortable comparable to a person and I have no complaints about it love is the same thing as this picture I don't see how this can actually one-size-fits-all basically we get out some like that bit later on so for me I liked it and you think it looks nice just looks so much better than the American minister on here today if I still probably prefer anything I was drawing a little bit and and subsided on this one is a bit of a future so yes turn wash them all now on and on to the final segment okay then so final section now I've made a rookie error but what all same dry sort of them and I think this will be very probably not I've got like old metal radiators and just pop them on there to air dryer and it's like rust marks on four of them so we're just connect any expectant really that I'm going to rewash the little bit bleached Rimmel if you think it'll come out fingers crossed and I'm going to mention it I'm going to overlook it because that's my fault not t-shirts but the only one that's alright it's the answer stories one because the tracks out on the back of the chair anyway so let's signal that moving on from that at least favorite no surprises going to be the American vintage one let alone because of the composition of it with the ankle aerobics you mentioned at the beginning but there's no way that is worth this much money and it doesn't look like benefit I think it looks at cheapest it doesn't sit well it's not flattering I will literally only wear this around my handsome to bed now and it was fifty sixty five-pound think it's 55 isn't it so yeah just not know just you know basically well guys I'm find again were biking notes anyway definitely made a lot of them and then it was tough so maybe I'll turn it when we do that more wintry one but I was so impressed by this is so unflattering and yes that was right great second track basically brand and meldova cancel sizing now this is a fine teacher and you are a size 60 or ten then I would do recommend this t-shirt but I don't see the point isn't doing one size fits all with runs like a sauce coming a similar lower price boy and you can actually go and get your actual side if you try to ate my pie oh this is the ideal fit for you anything else big booms like 10,000 up no not so 12 and a post there or if you have big boob it's not going to be the ideals of it you can definitely find them that's a bit much better but actually going on to shop that stock sizes so I'm interested to see how one size fits all thing works and I know it's shot that probably appeals to a much younger audience as well and that probably made the teenagers when I went in there and said it was just for teenagers and you know that makes more sense for it but again I wish the vibe from there again well I could because it just fit but it's not I'm going pressed by the fact that there isn't that much of an option there for different body type at all so that was in the second place oh by the way they've all washed fan sites and fatter ruined ball they have a watch sign that the no changes any of them so if you were a side a and let's look at this t-shirt and if you go through it but I recommend the two other ones and similar price point it phase with that and if they're sort of shop we've done one I like this t-shirt a lot and it does have a really nice situate I like the kind of slows of effect that's going through it and it's not worse than remain really 80 pounds of t-shirts fixed alternate just have a really nice bit to it feels nice on I will wear this a lot I know that I will works a lot I quite like the fact it's not actually a slight the same to go to the American Vintage once it was its own battery it's quite nice but it's a more ivory color and it looks really nice with denim as well so I like that about it I like to show you don't you go spend this much money on the white teacher so I saw would definitely be interested in want someone trying out the denim that they have and actually might actually have to bite the bullet and five pair at some point back in reviews and see you guys because it's got me interested in the brand well I don't think you need to go spend some money on a white t-shirt and it definitely has got me interested in having a look at the new more things from redone so yeah if you felt like it you felt like you today pal t-shirt I'm saying I never want for you however you can definitely get this much cheaper because my two favorites are answering a lot now and they've got an excellent second horizon and being super super picky here but the answer on one is ever so slightly softer without compromising any of the structure of the teacher at all and the sleeves that say it's just slightly better and sleeve kind of fit nicely there's really just subtle differences that makes me feel a lot of fits me better and overall softness of it however they're both fantastic t-shirt this etalon to six passes absolutely brilliant like if you I mean I lie beside example and just have them on rotation and ruin the more by one by the rising of a radiator it seems but it's such a good teacher such a good price it fit really well it just it looks really good you know compared to that this stop blowing my mind compared to the moment vintage one which actively looks bad in my opinion was so flattering and this was so good for a fraction surprise unbelievable as a hugely impressed by this as you have other t-shirts from a lot a lot a lot lots maybe be a bit of entertainment but if you playing feature to myself and a mic serious long-term they're absolutely finding the washer has no issues any of the a substitution perhaps so going even further for like specks of synchronous do recommend to the great white t-shirt and yes the absence always one just wins this is the only one that kind of got rust on it as well as I was saying and but this is a one way I washed them all actually wore this again yesterday this was one that I reached for officer how well choice came out and this is one that I reach for like I'm looking forward to wearing this on the boat so that's what was really telling it just fits really well it's really soft there is and look at the difference and how it feels in the Aces want to qualify what is literally double in price however 13 pounds 12 and no 17 pounds well there are part number as we've written someone and however much you want it's worth how much it was seventeen pounds I think so yeah this one is swingin first place a destroyer is consistently strong in this theory now when people say to watch their the high street brands so often I like I recommend them stories because I have so many pieces from them that have been really fantastic so once again under storage arrays reigning supreme that is everything and rigging backflip on shoes next which is R imaginary to get on with altering those I hope you've enjoyed this was like I said watching after you next one", "3S4bkFRgEOo": "hey guys welcome back to my channel so as you can tell by the title of this video today I'm going to be showing you how bleach and supplement my t-shirts so it's really fun it's a simple process this is just how I do it lots of people do it many different ways there's no right way or wrong way it's just how I do it and it's really simple it's really easy anybody can do it and I will show y'all how to do that today and let's get started okay guys so I'm outside and I'm sorry it's super bright I know but that's exactly what you want you want it to be as hot as possible and full Sun so that's what's gonna give you the best bleach it will turn it super fast and have pretty cloudy day it will it'll turn it'll take a little bit longer it might not turn as much as you want it so I just have my shirt here it's laying on just an old towel I'm just doing this because I'm working on a trailer because I don't have like a concrete driveway if you have a concrete driveway all means sweep it off throw that baby down on there it'll be fun but my trailer here is a little bit dirty so trying to keep it as clean as possible it has to be washed later anyways but still this is a George brand shirt from Walmart it's 65% polyester and 35% cotton so if you are planning on doing sublimation on this make sure you have at least 50% polyester or greater the greater the better okay so I just have my bleach here and straight bleach I don't mix my bleach so here we go just going to spray it on I want my design kind of in this area so I'm gonna spray it a little bit heavier here and a mist so to be more solid and then I'll put spots everywhere let's just do it I'm trying to film and do this at the same time so hard sorry I always try to spray the bottom so it has dots and if you just barely squeeze the trigger it's what gives you those big drops that's what gives it more dimension and looks prettier in my opinion it's totally optional whatever you want to do all right so we're just gonna let that sit there let the Sun do its job and I'll show you in just a second okay so it has been about five minutes I'm not sure if you can even tell on camera because it's so bright out here but it is bleached a little bit it's not quite as much as I want so I'm just gonna add a little bit more that's all you have to do and I didn't want this shirt just super bleached so it's okay so I'm gonna do that and also I wanted to show you if you want like the creases in the bleach all you have to do just like wrinkle your shirt up kind of like this and when you spray it it's gonna miss those areas and it gets really cool things this one I didn't really want any so I left it pretty much flat I hope you can see that I'm gonna let that Sun just a little bit and then we're gonna flip it over and do a little bit on back see you in just a sec okay so it's been about five more minutes and it's been a hundred degrees here in Oklahoma so it's pretty much dry and that's all you got to do is wait for it to dry if it's not as good as you want it you just add more and wait for it to dry so I think this is about as good as it's gonna get for the front so I'm just gonna flip it over and we're gonna do a little bit on the back you can see it already or I hope you can see that some already went through to the back especially the bigger spots so I'm just gonna add just a little bit more and that's all its going to need alright wait five more minutes and then this will be on to the next base okay so this is about done it's been about five more minutes it looks pretty dry so the next step is going to be taking it in and washing it in hot water hot water is what will neutralize and stop the bleaching process some people use peroxide they just spray the peroxide all over it and then they wash it that's just personal preference I just found that hot water works for me so that's just what I do so I'm just gonna go do that and then I will show you how i sublimate the finished product okay yo so I've got my shirt finished bleach ink I got it washed and dried you can see a little spot the Lighting's not that great in here I'm in my laundry room you know you got to work with what space you got and this is the only space extra I have so I've got my heat press on and it is heated up to about 400 I'm gonna do it for 60 seconds so I've got it lined up I made sure that my collar is just off the back so it doesn't have a hump right there same on the sleeves and I've got it lined up where it's right in the middle now this is the design I'll be putting on and I'm sorry I'm holding my phone and doing this the same time so bear with me so we are just going to line this up right here okay you see how just uh you know eyeball it alright so I think it's lined up pretty good so now I'm going to take my parchment paper just lay that on top to protect any ink from coming through and then I actually put on this little paper here as well okay so we are going to press for 60 seconds lot pressure not real hard now we wait okay there we go I hope you can see that okay yeah so that was it super simple right didn't take very long at all the hardest part about it is waiting for your shirt to be washed and dried so I wanted to show you the finished product here it is you can't fill this sublimation is just ink and if I have my nice clothes I wouldn't even know it was there cannot fill it at all the bleach bleach is pretty good some bleach some shirts will bleach broader why this being a really light color that's why you can't see the bleach as much some blacks bleach to front light so it's like really pretty it's black with white on it and it's really good so you should have to kind of play with what color shirt and you want and what colors you're wanting it to end up as so that was it this shirt will be listed on my Etsy store if some of you don't want to make the process yourself do it it will be linked in my Etsy store I will put that link down in the description box below and you can go to messy store and see what all I have I'd love to help you out if you're not wanting to do the

"qSsSEafthio": "today we're taking a look at this the bamboo fiber t-shirt this is the olive green color we also ordered the dark green first the fit I usually wear an extra-large and this thing that's pretty true to size it fits great in the body it's a little bit shorter on the arms and I would usually wear but it's not too short at all and the neckline is really nice as well it's not too tight it's not too loose kind of somewhere in the middle the material is a hundred percent bamboo which gives it this quite cool texture it also feels really soft on its really comfortable to wear it's all really well stitched as well with good double stitching here on the sleeves comfortable stitching around the neck clean lines down the side and double stitching again on the bottom the one controversial thing about this t-shirt is that it's got a stitch that goes down the middle and the back is scooped and slightly longer now these things both look great but stylistically it's worth keeping in mind if those are things that you're into there's really nothing to fold this t-shirt that's super comfy it looks great so I'm giving it a nine point eight out of ten this has been another

22nd 2020 through november 30th 2020 right now there is a huge sale going on as you guys know sawgrass hardly ever has any sales um i don't think that i've ever seen a cell so right now the inks are on sale so if you guys already have the printer maybe you guys need to replenish or um you guys want to order some extra inks or anything like that so the sublijet inks are on sale for 65. the caesar ones are 74 but the chromoblast ones that i'm talking about today are 48 the chromoblast inks are way cheaper than the sublimation now what is chromoblast compared to sublimation right you can still get it in the sg500 and the sg-1000 so whichever printer so it's the exact same printer it's just different inks so please note you cannot switch from one ink to the next you have to purchase a separate printer for that so if you're going to have sublimation you'll want a separate printer for your chromoblast chromoblast is for your 100 cotton so this is not going to work for your substrates or anything like that this is going to be only a hundred percent cotton so maybe you want to add something on some you know cotton shoes cotton shirts sweatpants anything like that it needs to be a hundred percent cotton and you can go from light colored fabrics up to some pretty bright ones so we'll get into that um there's tons of videos to come so please uh stay tuned for that you could definitely check out the uh playlist down below if this is a year from now i'll have a ton more videos covering this stuff chromoblast versus sublimation sublimation is it has to have polyester where this one has cotton so the sublimation goes into the shirt it becomes one with it where you can't feel it now this one the chromoblast also goes into the t-shirt but you can feel it so it doesn't set on top like dtg or screen printing but it does have that same feel but it actually goes down into the fibers it if you guys come over here which i'll have these linked down below you guys can kind of come down here and it'll talk a little bit about it it's got vibrant colors um it talks about how it will never fade so the thing about it compared to dtg and screen printing it will never crack or fade it works the same since the sublimation except for you can have feel to it compared to sublimation if that makes sense so if you guys have been wanting to um you know to work with 100 cotton highly recommend you check this out if you guys have been wanting a dtg printer but you can't afford it i highly recommend that you guys check this out so just as as the other one the sg500 is 5.99 the sg-1000 is 1549 and these are going to come with the inks so the thing with this chromoblast just like sublimation has a special paper this is a separate paper you're going to want to use the chromoblast paper so the paper with the ink together is going to make this magic happen all right so let's go ahead and jump right into this video so for today once again i've got my design already brought in here and this is what i like to do everybody asks me all the time how do i size this how do i get it where i want it so say for example today we're using the sg500 i know that i want a full sheet so this is the smaller one you really want to use they recommend over here you really want to use the sg-1000 for t-shirts and stuff so i know for me with the sg 500 i need the full sheet the full eight and a half by eleven so what i like to do is come to blank products and then i just type in 8.5 and i'll go to the 8.5 by 11 and there it is so i can just kind of mess around with it here and get this like a full sheet and if you pay attention over here on the side i have it on inches you can do millimeters or inches you can kind of see that there so i just bring it down a little bit less than the 11 so it'll fit on the page and then center it up you can always use your grid there so you can get it right in the center so you know when you put it down on the shirt it's going to be centered and then when you go to print you want to make sure that it's going to be mirrored and you don't need the bleed lines i'm going to make sure it's mirror when you have the chromoblast printer you don't have all the options like before it's easy peasy it's cotton chromoblast paper you don't have any options color mode you can still choose you've got photographic graphic grayscale or classic i leave it on photographic and then you've got high quality high speed same thing like that at this point it's ready to go i would hit print and send it over to the spm so that's it so let's go ahead and head on over and make a shirt all right so now i've got the heat press ready today i'm using my tea padded so i've got a bigger tea patty here only because this is a small shirt i need to get those seams out of my way because i've got a 15 by 15 press so that's what's going on there and then because i have that pad i couldn't get this to shut i could if i really played around with it but i just thought i'd hold the pressure myself probably a wrong wrong example for you guys but this is only if you have the t padded most you guys probably wouldn't even be doing this but uh here's our design so i've got that printed out now keep in mind with chromoblast you want to work fast so we're sublimation we can print that we can mess with it in a week you know a month from now this you got to do right now there's a whole time on that i'll get the exact timing on that for you guys soon and then i'm going to cover it with a cover sheet so i've got it down i've got my cover sheet and i'm going to push this down i've got it 375 for 30 seconds the cool thing about this it's less heat and less time so i'm giving it like a medium pressure i'm doing it myself because i've got the tea pad it like i said and then quickly i'm going to work fast now the way that you're going to do this is pull your shirt so pull pull pull and it's going to number one help those the ink settle down into the t-shirt and help bring this off because if you guys don't pull this fast enough you guys are going to have almost like a um i'm not explaining you guys will notice on the glasses right here on the right side that little bit almost like it's where it's going to try to peel it off a little bit so work quick just pull and you know pull from the sides pull from the top that's it so i hope you guys enjoyed this i hope you found it helpful if you did please hit the like button down below and subscribe and i'll see you guys on the next one", "IDRzrU-sNWQ": "if I was to summarize what Sun spell is all about as a brand is about quality this is the signature Sun spell t-shirt in black we made some of the earliest t-shirts ever going back into the eighteen hundred's the fabric itself is very special long staple pima cotton from California that then is spun in India twofold where it's gasped before being brought back to the UK Roxanne is now going to cut the fabric it's one of the more mechanized activities that we carry out here in the factory although we still do cut by hand if she was cutting by hand the maximum number of t-shirts she could cut at one time would be three here she's cutting twelve and we might go up to 24 first operation is twin needs laying the arms to the bodies and the machines remove any surface material to ensure that you get a completely smooth internal surface after the twin needling of the arms the t-shirt is moved to overlocking where the body is sewn together it is not a simple or unskilled process at all because our fabric moves a great deal in fact Wow who's doing this operation has been with us for forty eight and a half years so a very very long time a lot of people in this Factory have turned this very much into an awful [Music] we're creating that neckline on a binding machine this is a particular technique that comes from our underwear heritage where you have a bound neck the binding that we're using here is from the original fabric batch and we do that to ensure that there are no differences in shade this is the neck binding stage of the process when these strips are bound to the neck of the t-shirt so the important thing about this is that the tension is maintained at a consistent level so that the neckline itself remains symmetrical back to bow now who's really completing the final piece of the jigsaw which is over locking the t-shirt sides and creating the final shape the labeling is very important because each label says Made in England that means a great deal to people internationally and to customers here in the UK because it is a mark of quality still maintaining a British manufacturing base here is fundamental to the brand it reflects our quality it is a continuation of our history when we do outsource we apply the understanding that we have here as a British manufacturer to the partners that we work with overseas the principles that have built the business and built the brand if you can maintain those principles from your heritage and apply them to today's environment then you're creating something that's not only special because of its past because of what it is today but is also building strong foundations for the you [Music]", "fJH4ulFOIoc": "- Hello and welcome. This is Angie with\nthecountrychiccottage.net. Today, we're gonna talk about\nsublimation on a cotton shirt. So if you can believe it or not, this is a cotton T-shirt and I actually sublimated this design. So what is the trick to\ngetting sublimation on cotton? 'Cause you've probably always heard that sublimation can only be on polyester. That's kind of true. Sublimation can be on\nany polyester surface and it just so happens that\nboth glitter heat transfer vinyl and there's even a polyester\nflocked heat transfer vinyl, your sublimation will actually\nreact with those products. I'm giving two products a try today. The first is a glitter\nheat transfer vinyl, and I'm gonna link to all the\nproducts in the description below, so you can find those easily. So this is from B-Flex, and\nmost glitter HTVs will work. You do wanna make sure like they have some polyester content. And then they also have a\nflocked heat transfer vinyl. If you don't know what a flocked is, it's kind of fuzzy, and it's actually polyester, it's intended to be used\nwith a sublimation printer. So you can actually print directly on this if you have a sublimation printer and add it to your cotton designs. But we you are going to not use a sublimation printer because I know a lot of you don't have one. We're actually gonna\nuse sublimation markers. So I'm gonna use this Artesprix brand, this same technique will work\nwith any sublimation product. If you have a sublimation\nprinter, it'll work with that, it'll work with any sublimation ink like sublimation markers, it'll also work with infusible ink and\ninfusible ink sheets. So the same method on the\nflocked heat transfer vinyl, as well as the glitter\nwill work for both these. So this is the glitter that\nI'm wearing and then this shirt is actually made with the flocked. So I'm gonna show you how\nto make this cool watercolor effect on the design, just as an example, but you can definitely use this\nsame method for any designs. You could draw with the pens\nand your Cricut machine. You could cut something out\nwith like the infusible ink sheets and then add it on top\nof the glitter or flocked HCV. So let's take a look at the\nsupplies you'll need and then make our project. The supplies we're gonna\nuse are as follows, so I'm gonna use some Artesprix\nthermal transfer markers. So these are sublimation markers. Then we're gonna need\nsome protective paper, some heat resistant tape,\nand then you'll need some regular copy paper. Now the copy paper will need to be rated for use in a laser\nprinter or copy machine. Just check the back of the package to make sure it's rated to that. And then you'll need a plastic bag. So literally plastic bag\nout of your kitchen cabinet, I recommend a disposable brush\nbecause you can't really, I don't feel like you can\nget the ink out of it. So I always use a disposable\none and then just a little plastic cup or some water, and then some T-shirts. And we are gonna give this a try with two different products. This one is the glitter HTV. So it's a white glitter HTV. And this one is a flocked HTV. It's a polyester flocked HTV. So this particular flock, you don't have to mirror\nit when you cut it. And we'll talk about that in a minute, but if you have like a\nreally intricate design, you may want in some transfer tape to transfer it to your shirt, the transfer tape will need to\nbe something that's rated for heat transfer vinyl. I may or may not use transfer\ntape depending on how my design looks once I cut it. But if you're using a different flock one that's not meant to be printed on. You will wanna make sure\nit's a polyester flock so that your sublimation\nwill actually go into and have that chemical\nreaction with the product and be permanent. So be sure it's a polyester flock. Let's get started first by\ntaking a look at the sublimation markers and how we're gonna\nuse them in this case. All right, so I have my copy paper, and what I'm gonna do\nis pick three colors, completely up to you\nhow many colors you pick and what colors. So I'm gonna go from\npurple to a dark blue, to a light blue. And what I'm gonna do is\nactually write with these on this plastic bag. So I'm gonna write with\nthe purple up at the top, and then I'm going to\nwrite with the darker blue somewhere over here to the side, and then I'm gonna put\nsome of the lighter blue over here on this side. Now what we're gonna do\nis add some water to this. So this is just a cup with\njust a little bit of water and our disposable brush. And we're just gonna\nstart with this purple and add in a few drops of water. Basically, we're making\nour own water color, but with sublimation ink. So now that I have that good and watery, I'm just gonna take some of that and I'm gonna put it on\nthis laser copy paper. So I'm gonna go all the way across this with my watercolor design, because I know that my\ndesign is long and skinny. If your design is small, you can just do a small area or you could do the whole piece of paper. Next, we're gonna do this blue. And what we're gonna do right here on the, the plastic bag is drag some\nof the blue to the center here and drag some of this purple\nand mix those together and create a completely different color and add that right under the first. Then I'll grab some of the blue, add that, and we will do this\nlightest blue and add that. Again, you can do this\nhowever you would like. There are no rules to this at all. And you can even go back\nand add some more color if you wanted to at this stage. So let's more purple to that, just completely up to you. How you want yours to look. Then we want to set this aside and allow it to dry completely. So it's really, really wet. I'm gonna allow that to dry completely. Now I have a few that\nI've already completed and allowed to dry. And here's my two designs. As you can see, like they're kind of\ndifferent, kind of the same, and we're gonna use\nthese and cut the design on our Cricut out of\nthese pieces of paper. So let's take a look at the design itself, cut our paper that now has all\nsublimation ink right on it. And we're gonna cut our glitter\nas well as our flocked HTV. So here we have our Cricut\nmat and we wanna place, this is the glitter and\nthe glitter goes face down on the mat or shiny side down. And then I've set my dial, I'm using the Cricut Explore Air two. This will cut with any Cricut machine, but I set my dial to custom and I picked glitter iron-on from the material list. And I'm also going to pick more pressure, just to\nmake sure that it cuts all the way through. And then I also mirrored my design. So anytime your material\nis face down on the mat, you want to mirror the design itself. So now we can cut the\nglitter HTV with our Cricut. (machine cutting) So once the cut's done, we can eject it from our Cricut, and then we can remove\nthis one from the mat. Now, we will want to also cut\nthe paper that we added the sublimation ink to. And we wanna cut that mirrored as well. So what I did is I took the paper and I used a pair of\nscissors to cut fairly close to where I had painted my design. And I want to put that at\nthe top of my Cricut mat. And now we can cut the same design we just cut from the glitter, we'll want to cut from\nthis piece of paper, using the Cricut. This time however, I'm gonna set my dial to the paper setting, and then we can cut our design. (machine cutting) Once that's done cutting\nI will eject it as well. Now let's take a look at the\nweeding of these designs. So now for the weeding. So for the glitter, I just cut off the excess\nlike with a pair of scissors so I can use it for another project. And then we just peel back all the excess. So we want everything around the outside as well as in this case, I\nwant this center home piece to come out and I'm just\ngonna carefully remove that. So what I would like to do\nis actually use the home for another quick test or project. And I also want to leave, in this case, the centers of these letters and just remove the word itself. So I'm gonna just gonna\nkind of carefully do that, leaving the centers of\nthose letters in place. So I'm gonna do that for the entire word. And then we'll talk about\nweeding the copy paper with that sublimation ink on it. All right, so there's that\npiece completely weeded. So now let's talk about this copy paper. So we're basically\ngonna do the same thing. In this case, I can probably just lift up the Tennessee itself maybe. If you have problems with curling, what you want to do is flip your mat over, and remove the mat from the material and not the material from the mat. And we'll also wanna get out the centers of these letters. So I'm gonna pull off\nthis large piece first. In this case, it'll be two large pieces. Then we'll grab the\ncenters of those letters. Like I said, I kind of have a plan I wanna try to use the word\nhome for another project. We'll see if that works. So I'm just kind of\nbeing gentle just in case I can get it to work. And what I like to do is kind\nof put those pieces right here, so I don't lose them. So I'm gonna be working\non some other stuff and I can just put them\nright there on my mat. And I know that they're\nnot going anywhere. All right, so I've got the centers I need, the two large pieces I\nneed, and the glitter. So let's talk about the\nflocked version of this design. So first things, first, the flocked itself I needed to cut on the green mat. The blue mat was simply not strong enough. I cut it on like a fairly new green mat, a purple mat would probably\nactually work as well. So you need a little bit of a\nstronger grip for the flocked. And then the second thing\nI'm gonna talk about is the fact that there is\nright now as of this airing, I did not see any flocked\nheat transfer vinyl setting on the Cricut. So I tried the glitter. So I did the glitter iron-on\nsetting, more pressure, and we are gonna see how well that worked. So this one we're gonna leave that, there's like a backing paper. Again, we did not mirror the flocked, and you will see why in a few minutes. And the cuts actually look pretty good. So I'm just gonna kinda\npeel everything back. And the T is separate from\nthe rest of the words. So we're gonna peel it from this side. 'Cause this one says Tennessee, while the other one said home. And again, I'm leaving the\ncenters of those letters and this is fairly\ndetailed, so I may go ahead and show how to use transfer tape. Again, if you have a simple design, you could just peel it from this paper. So there's our Tennessee, worked great with the settings that I used. And then we can just weed\nthe paper in the same manner as we did the paper for the home. Again, this one is mirrored. So you wanna mirror for the flocked, don't mirror the design itself, but mirror the sublimation drawing, and you will see why when we press, but that's gonna be\nimportant to get it right, is to not mirror the flocked. And again, it has to be a polyester flock. So don't mirror that. If you purchase the same\nbrand that I'm using and then mirror the actual\npaper that you added that sublimation ink too. So there's that. So I have everything I need on this mat and I'm gonna leave it there. These pieces are super, super small, so I don't wanna move those. So I'm gonna leave that\nand I'm gonna go ahead and get out my easy press and get set up to press these. All right, the B-Flex glitter presses at 295 for 10 seconds. And I have my largest easy press so I can cover this large\ndesign in one press. Now I'm going to first just\nkind of heat up the surface a little bit, getting your\nwrinkles and moisture out, and then what I'm gonna do, I know that I'm gonna be\nsublimating on this in a minute, so I'm actually on top of\nmy largest easy press mat, but I'm gonna stick a\nsmaller, easy press mat, the medium size one inside the shirt. And then I'm gonna use some\nprotective paper to cover that mat up. I wanna make sure that\nit's completely covered where my design is going to go. Just so I don't get anything on my mat and nothing on the back of the shirt. That's just for sublimation. If you were just using\nthe glitter by itself, you would not have to do that. All right, so now the shirt's cool, we're ready to press. We're gonna locate the\ndesign on the shirt. All right, and the carrier\nsheet's already on this, we just need to press, so we'll go ahead and put that down, press with medium pressure\nfor the 10 seconds. And then when the time's up, just remove our press. And we can actually start kind\nof peeling this right away. Just be careful that it's not so hot it's gonna burn your fingers and everything looks really good. We'll just make sure that E stays, okay. So now that design is on our shirt. Now we wanna make sure that's cool. It's already pretty cool, before we put the sublimation on. So as soon as the sublimation\nhits anything hot, it will start to transfer. We can go ahead and set the easy press. So we wanna set it at 360, and we are gonna set it for 100 seconds. Let's do 120. So it says 90 to 180. So I'm gonna do 120. So this is heating up. Our home is cold. So now we can locate our design. And to do that we're gonna\nuse heat resistant tape. So don't use any type, you wanna make sure it's heat resistant. Then we can start taking those pieces that we weeded earlier, placing them on top of this glitter and taping them into place. Now, remember, these are\nthat laser copy paper that we did the watercolor effect on. So they have that sublimation ink on them, and we've already put our easy press mat covered by butcher paper inside. So we know that everything's protected. We will just put this into place and\nyou can just tape it down really well. You don't want it to move during the pressing process. And we'll also have some centers, so I'm gonna leave that\ncenter open just a minute, and we'll tape in just a second. So now I just have the\ncenters of all those letters. And again, we want to make\nsure to put those face down on their corresponding letter, and then we'll tape every\nsingle one of those down really, really well, making sure\nnothing moves when we press. All right, so to press this design, we will need to cover\nit to protect our press. So I'm gonna use a piece of\nthat protective paper again. So you have the paper, then\nthe sublimation ink design, that glitter HTV that we\npressed underneath that, the shirt, another piece\nof protective paper, and our easy press mat. And then I have the back of the shirt and another easy press mat just under there to protect everything. And now we're gonna press\nat that 360, 120 seconds, and you don't want anything to move. So we're gonna press it down, press the C and hold it with\npressure for the full time, not allowing anything to move. All right, so after the time's complete, again, we don't want anything to move. We're gonna lift it straight up, and then we're gonna allow\nthis to cool completely before we move this. All right, this is completely cool now. And we are going to start peeling back. And see what we got. So you can see that effect\non that glitter HTV, that kind of watercolor effect, where it's going from like a\npink to a blue at the bottom. And there, you have it. So sublimation on glitter HTV. Now let's move on and see what happens when we use that flock. Alright, so for the flocks\nwe need to be at 305 for 10 seconds. So I went ahead and set\nmy easy press to that, and that's going to be\ncooling down while we work. I went ahead and pressed\nover the top of this, just to remove any wrinkles or moisture. All right. The flocked, once again, we did not mirror it and it\nhas lots of little pieces. So we need to get it from this\nbacking paper onto the shirt. There is transfer tape that's\nmade for heat transfer vinyl. This is a piece of that here. You could also use a\npiece from an old project. So this was just from\nthe glitter I just used, that we just did the home, and I can just press that right onto here. So it's rated for use\nwith something like HTV. And so I can just use it as long as it'll kind of lift up from there. And the only thing when working with this, when working with the\ntransfer tape and HTV is the transfer tape is never, or I don't find it's ever\nlike really, really sticky. So you just kinda have to play with it and kind of peel it back. Just kind of play with it, peel it back and just make\nsure that it's staying stuck to your, whatever you use, transfer tape, an old carrier sheet, whatever. And then watch when you get to\nthe centers of those letters, they actually stay down and into place. So I'm just gonna keep\nmoving across this piece, making sure everything\ngets stuck to this tape, and then we'll press it\nand add that sublimation, just like we did on the glitter. So here's our piece completely\non this transfer tape. So I can just flip that over carefully and add it to our shirt. Now the easy press has cooled down to 305 and I have it set for 10 seconds. And we're just going to\nmake sure this is about in the center and that it's straight. And then, once again I've\ngot an easy press mat inside of my shirt covered\nby some protective paper, because I know I will be\nsublimating here in a few minutes it will just save me an\nextra step here to do that. So we're gonna press this 305,\n10 seconds, light pressure. And we'll remove that easy press. And you can actually remove\nthis liner while hot, just to make sure that it's not so hot it's gonna burn you. And we just want to make\nsure everything is stuck. Now we have that flock right on our shirt. And remember, this is\nthat polyester flock. So we can put our\nsublimation ink right on top. We are gonna wait until this\ncools off so that it doesn't start sublimating while we're adjusting. And then we'll do it just like the glitter where we'll put it in\nplace and tape it down. All right, so everything\nis taped down well where it won't move. And we're gonna put our\nprotective sheet on top of it. So protective sheet, the paper with the\nsublimation ink face down, taped down well to the flocked that's already attached to\nour shirt, protective paper, easy press mat, back of the\nshirt, another easy press mat. We're gonna press this down. And it's 360, 120 seconds, firm pressure. Then once your time is up,\nyou wanna lift it straight up so nothing moves. Then we went to allow this\nto cool completely before we remove the paper with the sublimation ink. All right, I've allowed this to cool. And now we can reveal the\nmagic and see if we have that watercolor design on that flocked paper, on that flock HTV. And it looks amazing. Totally awesome. All right, so there is how\nyou add sublimation ink to both flocked and glitter HTV. So it's super simple. And I know the first question\ny'all are gonna ask is how well does it hold up in the laundry? Well, I'm gonna tell you right\nnow that I have already ran these through the laundry\ntwice, both of these shirts. So you can see that\nthere was like no fading. That is absolutely 100% fine. Yes, you can still laundry these shirts and not have any problems. So if you were to use\nsublimation ink directly on the cotton without the glitter HTV or the flocked HTV between it, when you went to throw it\nin the washing machine, it would fade. So it would give you like\na really distressed look. It would be kind of semi-permanent. So a lot of it would come\nout as you laundered it. And I don't know how long\nit would last actually, but I actually ran these through twice just to kind of see what\nwould happen the first and the second time. And both the glitter HTV from B-Flex as well as the flocked can be dried. So actually ran both these\nthrough the dryer as well, no issues at all. So if you're gonna drop down\nbelow and ask that question, there's your answer\nright before you ask it. But if you have any other questions about anything we've covered today, feel free to ask those in\nthe comment section below. Also head to the description below, grab your supplies to give this technique a try for yourself. If you've wanted to try sublimation, you hate polyester shirts. I've heard that over and over again. I hate polyester shirts, or maybe you want to put it on a hat and all you can find are cotton hats. This is a solution. So glitter, heat transfer vinyl, as well as the flocks. Now the flocks you wanna make sure it has a polyester coating. I know that multiple glitters will work, but the flocked I am not sure about. So the only flock I tried was this B-Flex that's made specifically for sublimation. So I would definitely give that one a try. And I do not know about\nany of the rest of those. So if you are looking at another brand, I do not know if those will work. And I have only tried, I've seen other people try other glitters, but I've only tried\nthe glitter from B-Flex just to let you know that as well. If you'd love this video,\nif you learned something, be sure to give us a thumbs up. You'll also want to head on\nover to our YouTube channel, hit that subscribe button. We have videos like this all the time, and you don't want to miss any of those. I hope you enjoyed these\nshirts today and will try this watercolor technique for yourself. Again, the markers I use were the Artesprix sublimation markers, they also come in a\nwide variety of colors. So this is the 10 pack with\nlike the standard colors. I think you saw those in the video, but they also come in\nother colors as well. If you are interested in\nexpanding beyond the basic colors, but you can do the technique\nthat I use, where I took those and I kinda mixed them\ntogether on that plastic bag and create kind of all\nkinds of your own colors just by buying one pack. Thank you all so much for joining me and I will see you next\nweek with another fun video. Thanks y'all, bye, bye.", "jBxri8Fngj8": "This 100% cotton Jersey t-shirt style\nnumber 64000 is Gildan's answer to the Anvil 980 made with a slimmer fashion\ncut fit this shirt is perfect for anyone looking for something similarly styled to\nAmerican Apparel or Bella + Canvas but with a much less expensive price tag. The\ncollar, sleeve and bottom hem are all finished with a double needle stitch\nwhich in addition to creating a clean and fashionable look also adds\ndurability to the seams. Crew neck not what you're looking for? You're in luck\nwe have a v-neck in this style called the 64V00\nlike many other Gildan products the 64000 comes in a huge variety of\ncolors. What is unique about this shirt though is that twelve of these colors\nare heathered, meaning that the pattern is flecked and textured. It's important to\nnote that while all block colors in this shirt are 100% cotton the heather colors\nare anywhere between 10 and 65% polyester. If you're looking for a ladies\ncut shirt instead then check out the 64000L for a crewneck or the 64V00L\nfor a v-neck there are also youth and toddler sizes\nin this line so be sure you don't miss out on the 64500B and the 64500P", "0bVAA2ysojw": "[Music] what's going on guys welcome back to my channel and to today's video where I am gonna be searching and finally finding the perfect white t-shirt with a budget of 20 pound or 20 dollars which other same same thing so if you are like me and love a good white basic tee this is definitely the video for you because we've got seven different t-shirts to review from multiple different retailers such as you know we've got a sauce we got a Zara top man weekday and many more so what we're gonna do is score each t-shirt on three different things the fit of the garment the quality of the fabric and of course the price point but before we get started you guys should know that I like meaty shows to be an oversized fit nice and heavy weight and if possible a thick neck hem so let's get started with t-shirt number one which was also the cheapest out of the seven before we get started as I previously said we're gonna be written the t-shirt on the fit the fabric and the price point now how we're gonna do this is score each thing out of three so one being the worst to being in the middle and three being the best so to kick things off with t-shirt number one and covenant at the cheapest price point of seven pound ninety nine is this oversized t-shirt from new look I'm impressed so for the fit I'm going to rate this a two point five out of three as you can see it's a perfect oversize fit exactly what I was been looking for in terms of how oversized it is however the only reason I haven't scored this a three out of three is because of the neck hem as I said previously I like quite a thick neck and on if I'm being picky this is just slightly too small and but nevertheless a solid two point five out of three for the fit and then moving on from there to the actual fabric of the t-shirt now I'm gonna be honest considering this is the the cheapest out of the seven I was pleasantly surprised it's quite heavy weight it's not like a superlight t-shirt and you can't see through the actual fabric at all yeah it's just it's a lot thicker than what I thought it would be so considering it is the cheapest out of the seven I'm gonna score it too and then moving on from there to the price point now it's seven pound 90 it's the cheapest out of the seven t-shirts for that reason alone we're giving it a three out of three so the price point of three out of three the fabric a two out of three the fit a 2.5 out of three so close to being a three out of three but yeah the fit of 2.5 out of three so a solo start with t-shirt number one which of the oversize tee from new look I'm moving on to t-shirt number two and this is the oversized fitting t-shirt that we picked up from the Asus design collection so the fit of this t-shirt in my personal opinion is absolutely perfect as you can see it's super oversized it's got a nice drop shoulder just to top it off it's got a nice thick neck M so yeah to be honest I can't score the fit anything but a three out of three now moving on to the fabric and we're gonna score this a two out of three because to be honest it just kind of is in the middle it's not super heavyweight but there's also a lot of lighter t-shirts that I've seen and but at the same time it is not see-through or anything like that it's quite soft to touch so yeah it's not the worst fabric that I've seen but at the same time it's not the best so with a fabric we're gonna go a two out of three now next is the price point now this does come in at ten pound and so it is two pound more expensive than the previous t-shirt but I mean two pound isn't much and for that two pound I do believe you're getting a nice of fitting t-shirt so I'm gonna score it at 303 and then we have it t-shirt number two we picked up from the a soft design collection for ten pound and then moving on to t-shirt number three and we pick this one up from Topman and this also is coming in at ten pound so moving into the actual fit of the t-shirt to be honest I don't really think it's any different to the previous - yeah nice oversize fit if anything I would have a nice thick and neck hem and but for that reason I will score this a two out of three and I'm moving on to the actual fabric so be honest I was a little bit disappointed and it's not very nice to touch like it's not like a soft cotton and it's also quite lightweight as well and so it's not heavyweight it's quite it's not very nice to touch so I'm going to give the fabric of 1.5 hour three and then lastly the price point it's coming in at ten pounds so considering yeah it's a pretty good fit but at the same time the fabric isn't the best we're going to go down the middle and give it a two or three a nice t-shirt number three coming in from Topman I'm moving on to t-shirt number four which we actually picked up from Zara and this was coming in at twelve pound ninety-nine man so regarding the actual fit of the t-shirt I just don't like it I'm gonna give it as 0.5 out of three now moving on to the actual fabric of the t-shirt now that I was actually very impressed with obviously you can't see it on camera but it's super heavy weight a lot heavier than the previous t-shirts that I've shown you super heavyweight yeah it's nice and soft to touch obviously you know it's not see-through or anything like that but yeah definitely my favorite so far in terms of the fabric so I'm gonna give it a three out of three so the price point of the t-shirt comes in at twelve pound ninety nine and so to be honest kind of weighing it up super good quality fabric the fit isn't the best for me personally but obviously if this is the kind of fitting t-shirt that you are going for I'm just gonna go down the middle price point two out of three for 12-pound ninety nine I'm moving on to t-shirt number five now we can't do a basic t-shirt video without including a Uniqlo team so option number five is this oversized tee from the Uniqlo u collection now I can't remember whether this is twelve pound ninety or twelve pound 99 obviously the style of the t-shirt is a little bit different it does have the pocket on the left chest but regarding the actual fit personally I think it's perfect it's nice and oversized as you can see it's got the drop shoulder and it has got the perfect nice thick neck hem so yeah the actual fit of the Garmin I can't fault it we're gonna go with a 303 so moving on to the actual fabric of the Garmin again I can't fault it it's super super heavyweight and yeah anybody that's actually had one of these Uniqlo you oversized t-shirts before you'll know what I mean with it's like it's a it's a weird cotton it's 100% cotton but super super heavyweight it kind of feels like a canvas a little bit and but yeah I can't fault it really heavyweight again and it's not gonna shrink in the wash or anything like that so yeah fabric we're gonna give it a three out of three and then moving on to the actual price point at twelve pound ninety or twelve pound ninety nine whichever one of them is and either way super affordable you getting a lot for your money and like I said it's the perfect oversize fit for what I'm looking for the fabric super heavyweight so you're gonna get multiple wears out of it it's not gonna shrink in the wash so price point you've got to give it a three out of three so three is all round and then moving on to t-shirt number six and with this one we went back to Zara to cut this oversized t-shirt which is coming in at 19 pound 99 so moving straight into the fit this t-shirt is so so close to being perfect like this so when I say a nice thick neck and this is exactly what I'm looking for I've never ever owned a t-shirt with such a perfect neck and honestly this is exactly what I'm looking for but when I say it is so close to being perfect in my opinion so if I'm like just relaxing as you can see here in my opinion I feel like the sleeves like the length of the sleeves need to be a little bit longer and to be exactly what I'm looking for as you can see here and it is got a slight drop shoulder but yeah I just feel like the length of the actual sleeve to be perfect should maybe be about half an inch longer for that reason alone I'm gonna score the fit of this t-shirt reluctantly a 2.5 are three and then moving on from there to the actual fabric of the t-shirt it's not as heavy weight as the previous one from Uniqlo and but yeah it's a nice fabric again 100% cotton it's super soft to touch but like I said it's not as heavy weight as the previous one so regarding the fabric we'll go with a 2.5 R 3 regarding actual price point of the tee obviously this is currently the most expensive out of them all they say is 19 99 so taken into consideration I'm not totally although I love the neck hem I'm not totally happy with the fit of the garment and I wasn't 100% happy with the fabric because it's not super super heavyweight so taking those two points into consideration price point being the most expensive I'm going to give it a 1.5 R 3 so although I do really like the t-shirt considering like the price point and stuff like that and yet there's definitely others from the previous selection that I would definitely choose first over this one and then last but certainly not least is this oversized tee that I picked up from weekday and this is coming in at 20 pound on the button top of the budget so worth it I'm just gonna say straight off the back this is hands-down my absolute favorite out of every t-shirt that I have shown you in today's video like I said this is coming in at 20 pounds and but regarding the actual fit of the Garmin perfect as you can see it's super oversized and has got a nice drop shoulder again as previously stated it's got that super thick neck hem as well so yeah obviously a 3 out of 3 for the actual fit of the Garmin and then from there moving on to the actual fabric this is just so far ahead of every other t-shirt that I've shown you previously in this video and this is 100% brushed cotton so it is super soft to touch as you can imagine it is brushed cotton so super soft to touch and it is very heavy weight so Falls perfectly as you can see on the body and I have washed this multiple times it hasn't shrunk at all so yeah fabric again of three out of three and then lastly is the price point now as I previously said this is coming in at the most expensive at 20 pound however when you kind of take into consideration and you know how perfect the fit is for what I like how good the fabric is super soft to touch super heavyweight it's not going to shrink you know you're gonna get multiple wears out of it so when you kind of take in consideration all these different points I've got to give it a three out of three there's just no other option I would happily pay an extra ten pound and get exactly what I'm looking for in a t-shirt with the fabric you know the fear everything like that so yeah price point again eighty three out of three so that is a total for this t-shirt of nine out of nine and although the Uniqlo one was also a nine out of nine if if you only had like 12 pound 90 to spend then obviously that Uniqlo one is a perfect option but if your budget does allow you to spend that extra seven pound then I would definitely recommend this week they were so they were having guys that is a total of seven different t-shirts make sure you let me know in the comment section down below which of the seven was your personal favorite but that is it for this video guys if you did enjoy it as always please smash that thumbs up button hit subscribe if you're new and you want to see new content every Thursday and every Sunday drop a comment down below go ahead and follow me on Instagram and I will see all of you guys on Sunday peace [Music]", "c-BnQotQglQ": "hello hello we are going to do just a quick video showing how to use the designs I make and sell on my Etsy shop that are for waterslide you just print and cut them on to waterslide 4 cups and stuff I don't know if I have any out here ok like these are printed on waterslide you would let your machine cut it out and then you would put it on a cup but you can also use the same files and have it sublimated onto material so we are going to do a quick video on how to do that I already have a file that I want to use to print so I'm gonna open it up and when you print these you need to make sure that your image is mirrored so this is the image that I'm gonna do and this design here is one of my waterslide images so I'm just gonna flip it so that it's backwards we're gonna go up to print and then of course I'm gonna tell it to print to my sublimation printer the settings that I use to do this it is the text our paper that I'm gonna print on which is a special sublimation paper you can print directly just on regular copy paper and it works just fine but I'm gonna go up and I'm gonna do plain paper high-quality and I'm gonna tell it to go ahead and print while that's printing I'm gonna move you guys over here and don't look at my workspace it's a wreck okay so the directions for what I'm doing is I use the spray so that I am able to sublimate onto cotton fabric because sublimation is normally only good on polyester but you can buy special liquids that this is a concentrate so you mix 1 ounce of this liquid to I think 7 ounces of purified water or whatever so and then you would spray it on your garment of course you want to have it completely dry because if it's not brought dry it will burn too it'll turn like a brown yucky color it will burn to it so it needs to be completely dry we have our heat press going so I have to wait for that warm up but anyway you spray it down I put mine in the dryer to let it dry and like this is one that I did this morning anyway he let it dry when it's ready to go we will move on to the next step but I'm waiting for the heat press to finish heating up but in the process while that's doing the heating part they also offer other things that you can do sublimation on this is a printable HTV and it is made for 100% cotton it's called sub laughs Lex and I found it on actually Jenna found it for me on Amazon but it is the sub low flex - OH - and this is what this is also one of my designs that is on my Etsy store this is it is a vinyl so you would all again print it backwards weed out the white area because you don't want any of the white you want just the design so after you wheat it you put it on top of your shirt follow the directions of course and this is what it comes up to be they have one more let me find that shirt this shirt was done with it is a special paper but you print on again it is for cotton because sublimation you can do on polyester you don't need all this extra these extra things are to be able to do it on cotton fabric because cotton shirts are more common than a polyester shirt but it comes you get a special paper and then there's a powder so once you print out on this paper you get a little bit of the powder and you make sure the powder covers every part of the ink while it's still wet and then you kind of dust it off then you would set this paper under the heat press you don't close it down you just set it in about two inches I mean let it sit in there for about 30 seconds and then once it's done then you would put it on your shirt and go up but it comes with instructions so that's another way you can do it and this is what this one looks like it's also a shiny and you can kind of hear this one but this is a cotton shirt so and it does sublimate perfectly fine to it I don't want to show you all of the image because it's not my image so it's one that I found and I colorized I thought it was really really cute but it looks really great once you put it on your shirts and it took a lot of trial and error to get the colors the way that I like them doing different settings printing different papers I have bought several different papers but regular printer paper works just fine let me show some of these images okay so this is regular printer paper and the ones down here on the bottom that are really light this is also done just regular printer paper so it does do the color but you can tell the difference in color when you get like the special sublimation paper and then regular printer paper like you can see the difference just look at the flowers the difference in the color of the flowers they're kind of like pastel very soft here and then they're nice and vibrant here so there is a difference but it does work either way doing regular or buying the sublimation paper the sublimation paper isn't that expensive I think you get like a hundred sheets or maybe 110 sheets for I don't know less than $15 so it's not really that expensive I'm gonna go ahead and let my press finish heating up when it's done I will be back and we will finish this video okay now that the press has come up to the instructions on this particular way that I'm doing it state to pre pressure shirt for 10 seconds with very firm pressure so we're gonna go ahead and pre press and then here's our image so we are going to make sure our shirt is lined up to be able to put our image why don't you have your image add your protective and this is butcher paper that I buy I think it was I don't know it's not a huge role I ordered it online from Sam's Club comm so anyway it we are going to press for 60 seconds and this particular product says you press it it 90 degree are three hundred ninety degrees very firm pressure for a 60 second so that's what we're gonna let it go ahead and do and sublimation can be done on pretty much anything nowadays like they have sublimation products for all kinds of stuff the pop things on the back of your phone the little metal rings that you can put your finger through to hold your phone they have phone stands phone cases blanket shirts I've done acrylic photographs they have metal photographs I have a catalog of just a ton of stuff that you can sublimate on so the printer that I got is a Sawgrass SG 400 and I got it from us cutters it shipped very quickly like I had it within a couple of days and I've actually had no problems with it absolutely love it and it was just under 600 ollars I want to say it was five hundred and seventy-five dollars so we're done all we're gonna do is peel off our turn you guys shut that down okay I'm gonna turn it and there's paper in there I don't like it you're supposed to put something in there so it doesn't bleed through so that's it that's what you get when you're done and that is sublimation like I said the design the frog design I actually designed the whole thing but I sell the Frog design on my Etsy store it's all one word it's my crafters anonymous and I will put a link to it in the description but that is it this is done with my designs on sublimation this is also sublimation so I hope this helps thanks for watching guys", "P5ROJezBOOk": "hey everybody and welcome to another cricut craft tutorial before we got started make sure you subscribe to my channel we put out new videos on Wednesdays and Saturdays and I do have the occasional live video throughout the week today we're going to talk about how to do bleached t-shirts and this is the one that I made for the tutorial super easy to do really really fun and it only takes a couple of supplies so you'll need a t-shirt and I do recommend using a 100% cotton shirt the polyblend shirts will give you more of like a splotchy color so if that's what you're going for cool and they look really good but if you want more of like a solid plain color you'll want to go with 100% cotton you're gonna need a spray bottle or a mister and a bottle of bleach and that's literally all you need as far as your supplies and then with your Cricut you're just gonna cut out your decal that you can apply to your shirt and you'll need some transfer tape this is just done with a regular adhesive vinyl you could use 6:31 you could use Oracle 6:51 you could use Cricut brand whatever you have laying around maybe a color you don't really use very much is great for these projects so let's get outside and get started the first thing that you'll got that you're going to want to do is lay your shirt out now we are doing this outside because this can be pretty messy and we have our decal we need to place our decal onto our shirt now this is just 651 vinyl it's nothing crazy we're not doing HDV these were going to use this as our stencil and one thing you want to note is that you want to make sure if you want a single like specific color without like blotchy colors you're gonna want to use a hundred percent cotton shirt if you use a polyester blend you're gonna have some different colors and some blotchiness because that's just the way that that material reacts so here is our decal and it's usually placed at about 3 fingers from the collar and then I just kind of eyeball if it's straight it should be fine I'm pretty good at eyeballing straightness on these and that looks really good so then I'm just going to take a squeegee and press this down and the good thing is this likes to stick to shirts so it's really kind of nice you sort of make sure you keep your shirt fairly flat and then you're gonna take your transfer tape off you just want to make sure that your vinyl stays stuck to the shirt like I said it does like to stick to this so it shouldn't be too big of a deal should come off no problem but you'll want to take your time removing your decal or your transfer tape from your decal and again I just use a color that I like have a ton of or that I just don't think I'll use a lot because you're just gonna rip this right off anyways so I would just say use a color it doesn't really matter what color you use you can just use something you don't think you'll use a lot of this does help to hold the shirt down as you go and hold it nice and tight and you just want to watch some of the smaller pieces that you may have like his little dot on his nose just to make sure that everything stays down and all I'm gonna do is just one more time just kind of press down with my hands just to make sure that everything is down and we're gonna read flatten out our shirt a little bit just gonna shift my cardboard over just a hair there is cardboard under here and I do that so that the bleach doesn't bleed through so we have cardboard all along our inside of our shirt so now all you have to do is take a spray bottle this just has regular ol bleach nothing crazy in it and I'm gonna make sure that it is on and you've got to make sure with your spray bottle that you either have spray or mist or strength and we want spray so we're just going to gently spray it on and as soon as I spray it on what I do is I take a paper towel and I just da dab off all the stuff that's on the decal because I don't want it to bleed anywhere so we just do this very lightly and we go just a couple of times now I don't mind that mine is gonna be a little bit crazy and kind of all over the place I sort of like that but you can do it however you want that's the beauty with these shirts there's no right or wrong way you can add more to the sleeves if you want these are just all how you want to make them and so I just make sure like I said I just make sure that I do dab off anything that is on the decal you just don't want it believe and I just want to make sure that my decal shows up very very well so we are going to just make sure we get any of the spots that we think aren't showing up real good and you can use a smaller spray mist bottle those pen to work real well as for this as well and you can see I've got kind of a reddish color usually when you do the black it's a little more orange in color so it's just a matter of what shirt you choose and if you do colored shirts they're gonna be different as well a lot of the color church you'll end up with more of a white look to them okay I think that's pretty good as far as how much bleach we want to use on it so I'm just going to go across it one more time with a dry paper towel because I don't want to get bleach all over myself and they just want to make sure all the bleach is off Miggy Cal before I go ham on this peeling it off so I'm going to let this sit for just another couple of minutes so that it can dry a little bit more and then we'll peel off the decal okay we're going to go ahead and peel our decal and just because I just need to make sure I don't get any bleach on myself I'm just gonna wipe it one more time I'm kind of crazy about from getting any bleach on me remove those and then you just honestly just peel it like it was a label like one on sticky labels on your shirts just like so I'll always be easy to get off but once you get them started they're pretty easy once you get a corner up they come up real quick just a matter of sometimes getting that little corner you can see how nice and neat that still is you're going to want to rinse this right away with some cold water and that's going to deactivate your bleach so that you're not having any more bleeding and things like that to your letters and like I said I don't dilute my bleach I use 100% pure bleach I find that if you dilute it with water it tends to bleed under your letters a lot easier and we didn't want that to happen now you're not gonna get like a perfect line but that's kind of what I love about these shirts is you're never gonna have two that are the same which i think is a really fun now just for sizing reference this is just the child's extra-large this was just kind of an extra shirt I had laying around I hope this would be perfect to show you guys how to do this and again I do these outside I don't like to do them in my house make sure you are wearing some clothes that you maybe don't care about just because if you get any bleach on yourself it's going to end up everywhere and you don't want to get it on your Foott clothes and it will ruin them as we all know growing up you know in the era of everybody use bleach on everything I've had many a shirt for the bleach but on it we just have the little dog to go now and the nice thing is you can honestly bleach a spot out of your shirt just like a big blob and then you can each TV over that if you'd like color on it instead of just the plain shirt under it there's a lot of things you can do with these just get his little nosey and we are all done you guys can see this is a really quick and easy craft super fun to do and look at how good that came out I think this came out really really nice I love how easy this was and it only takes a few things to do it if you guys have any questions please let me know in the comments down below always happy to answer those for you make sure you subscribe to my channel I put out new videos all the time hit the bell icon that will alert you to when I post a new video have a great day and happy crafting you", "mrhLrLwk6ws": "hey everyone its Amy I'm in the studio I just went to Target and I found these really cute and colorful textile markers from kid made modern and I thought I would try them out with you for the first time on one of Jack's t-shirts let's do it the instructions say to place a piece of paper underneath the drawing area to prevent bleed through so let's do that got a piece of paper a little bit thicker smooth cardstock here and I'm using one of Jack's shirts that he's already worn and you can see that there is already some spots on it which I'm going to attempt to cover up so the shirt has been laundered and he's worn it probably only a couple times it's by American Apparel size twelve to eighteen months let's take a look at these markers says that they're double pointed oh I thought that they would be all in a row like that but they're not okay I think these would be good to play with at first I'm actually a little nervous right now I don't know how it's going to turn out but we're just going to give it a go and I have no idea what I'm going to draw let's just do some fun little shapes or maybe I should do a little scene because this is kind of green right here so maybe I'll do some clouds the reason doing these kind of small strokes is because I think it turns out a little bit better instead of dragging the fabric with me when I'm making the marks that's kind of cool should I color it in see what happens there's got to be a technique to this that I don't know about pretty cute I think I'm going to do a tree right here underneath it there's no brown though hmm that's right I'll do a palm tree yeah we'll just improvise right on palm trees can have great runks right why not let's try the other tip this is the thinner side see if we can color with it so I'm just going to actually take a seat and play around with this and see what happens right so I think it's done I had a lot of fun playing with these markers by kid made modern and they're available at Target and I think that they're special care instructions for washing but I'm planning on putting my 18 month-old in this shirt some time and hopefully taking a picture I think it's really a cute and cool way to spend some time getting artsy with this whole t-shirt and I guess what you could do to is add some detailing to the sleeves or even to the neckline and also to the back but I'm going to just be happy with this for now and put Jack in it and take some photos for you hopefully soon and in case you're wondering the reason the markers go in like this and not like this is because you don't fit that way so I'm going to be putting them back the proper way all right well I hope you enjoyed watching how this t-shirt came together I certainly had fun playing with the markers and I hope to see you soon thanks for watching if you have any suggestions for fun short little videos that I can put together in the studio please comment below I'd love to hear from you", "-5vWU4a93nc": "welcome back to the science by shy so today we're going to be doing a print to cut tutorial and if you are familiar with print to cut then you know there is a difference between doing a light-colored shirt or a white shirt and then a dark colored shirt or a black shirt so we're going to be using pin plus gear fabric transfer sheets and in this package you get 10 white or light transfer sheets and then five of the dark or black transfer sheets so I usually always buy this package because if you buy a regular package but this is Avery but if you buy a regular package separate it would still be fine with the dark sheets in one package and then the other package will be ten of the white sheets for the same price if you choose to buy this so we are using this this is my favorite favorite brand and this is what I use for every single print to cut shirt I do so we're gonna go ahead and get right into the video okay so as usual we're going to start with the blank canvas I'm gonna go ahead and go to upload I'm gonna go to upload and browse what one of the images were doing the other ones are right loaded set Cricut just gotta find the second image right here always complex that gets all the details of the picture and we're gonna keep [Music] see the thing was you're gonna go ahead and keep the whole picture continued safe now we're going to upload these two images for our shirts okay so as you can see over here to the right hand side you will see a triangle a yellow triangle and that is telling that something is wrong with this image and you need to fix something so you're gonna go ahead and click on it and it says image to large reduce image size to six point seven five by nine point two five four let's so with this image we're going to go up here and go to lock/unlock it everyone do exactly that six point seven five by nine point two five once you change the sizing of the image that triangle no longer appears there so now you know it's good to go to be able to make it and then with this image we're actually going to do six by six okay then now that we have the size that we want we're gonna go ahead and go to make it alright so these are the two images so with our first image the bear we are doing that on a light gray shirt and we are using light or white fabric cheats so we will have to mirror this image and now the second image you see which is mother Goose club image with that we are putting on a black t-shirt so with that we're going to use dark fabric sorry dark fabric transfer paper so we do not have to mirror the image so I'm gonna go ahead and first thing first we're going to continue got a sense of printer we are going to print this without the bleed all right so I'm actually not going to use the crickets that cut out the image so I'm going to go ahead and go to the next print to cut image everyone send that to printer take the bleed off and go ahead and print that and so now we just cut it with scissors as you will see in the video okay so this is where I do my printing that so as you will see if you read the directions for the transfer paper you will know the difference between the dark transfer paper and the light transfer paper because the light transfer paper will have red lines on the back and the dark transfer paper will have blue lines on the back so when you print you wanted to make sure the blinds are facing out which way you call in but the lines will be facing out your printer so same thing you put your paper in the lines will be facing away from where it prints out it because you wanted some prints on the plain side of the paper so for your red army for your light fabric chairs like I said once again red lines on the back for the lights or the white inner shirts or fabrics and then blue lines on the back for dark shirts or fabric alright so now we have both images printed off the printer and I'm not going to use the Cricut cicuta I'm going to go ahead and just cut it by hand with the scissors so you'll go ahead and cut it now for these if used to cut it with the Cricut it's going to cut the black line so you could either keep your black line and keep the border and just peel it and use it that way or you can go ahead and cut it so I'm gonna go ahead and cut that off though okay so these are two different images this one is the light transfer paper and you know that because remember we have the red lines on the back and then this one is the dark transfer paper and remember that because it has some blue lines on the back okay so first one we are going to do is the light transfer fabric or the light fabric transfer paper sorry okay so you're just gonna lay your image lay your image on the shirt or whatever blank you're using okay and then even though it has the sheet on there to protect it I still always use my what is this my I cannot think of the name of it right now okay whatever so go ahead and press it okay so here we go pressing it we're gonna go ahead and just do 20 seconds for right now so with your light fabric transfer paper it has to cool down before you take it off or it will mess up the image so we're going to go ahead and just put it to the side while we do our second t-shirt so as you may have already seen from my onesie video usually for kids t-shirts almost always have to use this receiving blanket just to raise up the middle of the shirt so with your dark fabric transfer paper you want to turn it over so this comes off so you want to take this off before you press it onto the t-shirt sometimes it's kind of difficult to get you guys there now you're just going to lay the image onto the t-shirt all right so in here um package you will get protective sheets these and you're going to go ahead and use that to go over your image this will be twenty seconds as well all right now that it has time to cool it down I'm gonna go ahead and peel it very slowly here's the outcome for the light fabric transfer paper and then the dark fabric transfer paper okay so that was the print to cut

sensitive fabrics I'm Courtney kapitza and I work with stahls TV and today I'm going to talk about a topic that I think is really growing and one that will hopefully help all of you decorators become more successful in 2017 if you tuned in at the end of 2016 we had a live class where we shared a lot of trends that we're seeing for the new year and for 2017 and one that is absolutely going to explode this year that started last year is the use of different blends of fabrics and specifically tri blends throughout garment construction we're seeing this trend really grow mainly so that the wholesale market can quickly achieve what we're seeing a lot in the retail industry and this is the use of garments that are soft more lightweight and feel more comfortable to the wear this is really what a lot of decorators are tending to move towards what they're seeing in stores and what they want from their wholesale or their custom apparel suppliers as well and so the great thing about blank apparel suppliers today like San Marbella canvas J America coffee o is that they're hearing these demands in there creating blank apparel that those of you in our decorated apparel industry can achieve and can get a hold of and press these for your customers so the manufacturers what they're doing is now they're taking fabrics that are more delicate to create that soft feel so they're traditionally fabrics like polyester rayon viscose which is another type of rayon fabric and they're mixing it into their cotton blanks to kind of create a drape fit and filled it really feels comfortable to the wearer creates that soft feel in the garment but what it does for decorators especially with heat printing or even screen print technology is it makes it more difficult or more challenging to print because we're taking a delicate fabric and we're bringing it and introducing it into heat and so we're going to talk today specifically about how we can achieve success was printing these garments what to look for in a heat-transfer how to make some changes at the application steps to help to eliminate scorching which is a common challenge with these fabrics because as you add more heat sensitive fabrics or higher contents of those into the garment we're now introducing and creating more heat sensitive blanks so today hopefully we're going to share some tips where I know we're going to share some tips to make you more successful and printing these types of blanks for any type of logo with your heat pressed and so it'll be a lot of hands-on demo here and I'm going to get ready to kick into that and talk through three specific principles as I do the demos they're going to be really important for you to be successful so I'm going to head over to the fusion heat press here now the fusion is traditionally a sixteen by twenty heat press what I have done here is I've actually loaded in a 11 by 15 platen this is going to be really important for the garments that I'm printing one I'm going to be using a lot of ladies garments throughout the class I'm also going to be trying to remove seams in areas off of my press to ensure accurate application and this will help me to achieve that as well and so my first garment that I'm going to be printing in today's class is a tri blend and so tripe lines are going to be the most popular heat sensitive fabric that you'll find on the market today this one is from San Marzano district maid line a try blend specifically is made up of cotton rayon and polyester you're usually looking at about 50 percent cotton and then a mixture of polyester and rayon and the rest of the blend depending on the fabric the rayon is going to actually be a little bit more heat sensitive than the polyester so if you can find a garment that has less rayon content it will be less heat sensitive this one specifically I'm looking at about 50% of the cotton 25% polyester and 25% rayon so I'm looking at 25% rayon content here now what I've done here is I've loaded my garment onto my platen and you'll notice that I'm threading it on when I load heat sensitive items on to my heat press platen one important thing to ensure is that you're getting all of the seams or raised areas off of the platon so I am using this 11 by 15 for this Ragland to pull these tight shoulder seams and collar off of my platen that way I can get an accurate application I also remember with any heat sensitive blank whether it's a polyester or a tri blend these seams because they're raised and higher are going to leave glossy marks if there's too much pressure applied to them it also can cause an inaccurate pressure as well so using a smaller interchangeable platen like this is going to allow me to help isolate this print location this way those thick seams won't get the extra pressure and gloss up which is very common for a tri blend as with anything I'm just going to preheat to remove that moisture and wrinkle down from my garment once I have my item completely flat which is the first thing I'm going to focus on whenever I'm loading a tri blend or heat sensitive items onto my heat press is my heat transfer selections for this garment I'm using a screen printed transfer that is called elasti prints so this transfer is actually a low temperature screen printed transfer and so I didn't choose to take a screen print transfer like you've proof that I've used for a number of years and just lower the temperature this one is specifically designed to apply at a lower temperature so it's going to allow me to reduce any scorching that tends to happen when you have a heat sensitive item and so elasti prints can apply it 300 degrees for 15 seconds and so 300 degrees is kind of that sweet spots on if you can go down to 280 265 like we'll see it a few other applications to lower the heat that the transfer apply that the better off you'll be when your heat when your heat applying these sensitive garment so lower heat is always ideal this 300 300 degree transfer is going to be the lowest screen printer transfer option that we'll have available it's also going to be a cold peel so I'll let it cool down here before I peel it back that was this application again it helps me work helps me to significantly reduce or completely eliminate scorch marks on these tri-blend fabrics now it's important to make sure we don't ever take a transfer that's recommended at three two one if it's never been certified at a lower temperatures you don't want to just take your heat press temperature down you want to find a transfer that's going to allow you to achieve that result so we'll let this cool completely feels pretty cold there so I'm going to go and start to peel it back and here I have my two colors screen printed transfer if you haven't used screen printed transfers before this one is from transfer Express that's their elasti print ink CIN screen printed transfers traditionally are very very good for getting that screen print look so if I'm trying to achieve something that it's going to be maybe a higher quantity minimum color count so I'm looking one two three colors screen print transfers are going to be ideal for those orders that are one two three colors you know hundred pieces fifty plus pieces that's why you can start placing my screen printed transfers because it allows me to print them very effectively and this is again printed with the Alaska print ink from transfer Express so that's one successful application that lower temperature helped us to reduce of actually eliminate any scorch marks that could have been achieved if we would have been in a higher temperature like 365 on this blank shirt so I'll set this aside and grab another tri-blend it's going to be a similar blend in the fabric we're still looking at a 50/25/25 blend between the cotton polyester and rayon but I'm going to look at another transfer type for this now this one is going to be a slimmer cut ladies garment so again we're seeing some shoulder seams that could get into the way and cause an accurate pressure or cause more scorching in those areas if they're left up on the platen as with the collar as well so I'm going to load this item onto my platen again using this 11x15 it's going to allow me to take the shirt and pull off all of those seams so I don't get that glassy seam if the pressure is over-applied there preheat just remove some moisture and wrinkles and then I'm going to line up my transfer now this transfer type is different from what we just saw this one is what we would call a digital transfer or a CAD print transfer so for something like this what I'm doing if I'm actually printing of a full-color image onto a printed heat transfer vinyl material and creating my transfer application and so this is from the super tech line but basically it's a great way to get full-color images onto tri-blend if you have a desire for that for maybe a corporate customer or even a school customer with some gradients or unique logos there now this transfer this super tech transfer this is actually sublist off it's going to apply down all the way at 280 degrees so again another low temperature solution that helps to reduce scorching on this fabric now I am going to make sure to use a cover sheet it's always good to use cover sheets for any transfer type outside of the screen printed transfer realm especially if you're with a heat sensitive garment it just allows you to place another sheet of protection between the garment and the heating element so have my press down to two hundred and eighty degrees for this application I'm going to take my transfer and apply it in a multi-step application with two steps of five seconds so I'm pressing this for five seconds once I do the first application what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and peel my carrier back and then the application just needs five more seconds to seal it down into the garment so when I make sure to cover that back up with my craft paper here in my cover sheet and then I'll press that for an additional five seconds at 280 degrees that gives me complete application again if I'm looking for a solution for lower quantities full-color again a low temperature option here for try blends while we're looking at this Karen if I have any questions come in throughout the open of the class here yes one of the viewers is printing on ninety-eight percent polyester 2% silver antimicrobial scroll and they're using the super tech opaque opaque media that was digitally printed on therapy and 20 do you have any suggestions for that job I don't have any suggestions other than I would recommend applying it as a two hundred and eighty degree application that's recommended for super tech I don't see any challenges with the ten percent that you're seeing there as long as I don't know if the item is a jacket or some type of outerwear I would just be concerned if it is to make sure there's not a coating on the fabric that can usually inhibit any heat transfer adhesive from sticking to it so you just want to caution against that and make sure there's no waterproof coating or anything if that's on the item but the fabrics together should work perfect with super tech okay great you guys have some questions throughout the class feel free to chat them in on the GoToWebinar client that we use they have a chat box with questions that you can easily chat those in and then Karen I'll send those over to me as we get them in give another one Karen one of the viewers asked if they should use a craft sheet as opposed to being kept one sheet for tri-blend materials either cover sheet so the question was do I use a craft sheet or a Teflon sheet either one will work perfect for the application that we're doing what I do recommend is just if you're putting it over a transfer where you would saw that I had pressed this transfer once peel the carrier and then left the finish exposed then I would recommend probably either using whatever finish you want so a craft paper will allow you to get more of a matte finish a Teflon sheet is going to bring more of a glossy finish so if I choose to use craft paper over the second hit it's actually going to matte up the finish on my super tech transfer here versus adding a little bit more gloss which is what the Teflon will do but both of them will protect the garment perfectly I kind of just like that craft paper a little bit better it's what I've used most often okay so for our next table here we're going to look at a fabric construction it's a little bit different both of those garments again were from San Martha from their district and district made line of tri-blend there and they've got a ton of great try blend opportunities this garments going to actually be from Bella canvas um Bella canvas also saw some tri blends they do a lot with blend as well as they're looking to get that drape of in that soft feel on the garment so we start to print these types of items again I'm looking at a content here that is 65% polyester 35% viscose rayon so we're seeing in two very heat sensitive fabrics we're actually not seeing any cotton within this garment as well and so that's why again we want to move towards something that's a little bit more low temperature for these types of options you'll also notice as I load this shirt on here that there's a pocket this included and so when I had mentioned a bit earlier about trying to get the print area as flat as possible trying to remove seams I have designed with this shirt in mind of putting a design down on the side of the shirt down here so it's going to allow me to completely isolate that print area are moving off all the seams of the pocket or any seams from the shoulders or the sleeves and it creates a unique print location which if you followed our trend is one thing that we're seeing very popular this year so again I got my item flat on my 11 by 15 platen I am going to dial back my pressure a little bit for this application since I have a different transfer type preheat that as I try and test the pressure and then this transfer you'll notice it's a cadcut transfer so if you're not familiar with this technology this is cut on a vinyl cutter these types of transfers work best for personalization lower quantities and this class is called cad-cut premium plus so premium plus similar to the last two transfers that we pressed has a application that allows me to go down to 280 degrees for these heat sensitive fabrics and when I run into somebody's heat sensitive fabrics so I'm going to line up my design here that says cheerleader covering with my cover sheet and then I'm going to press this for the application of eight to ten seconds at 280 degrees and Karen if I have any questions you can go ahead and shout them out while I'm letting this class and cool down a little bit another one of ours is looking for advice on printing a 100% polyester shell jacket with premium plus heat transfer vinyl they said that the jacket keeps scorching at 280 degrees for 4 seconds and then 4 more seconds and they were wondering if you could talk a little bit about adjusting the pressure on your compress 9 yeah absolutely so sometimes a scorching pressure is definitely something to consider if you're doing a print location like I have here I'm going to do some left test print as well if you notice that you're doing a smaller print location and you've moved to a smaller plat and you may find you're actually over plying there pressure even though you don't think that you are so premium plus requires a medium pressure on a 16 by 20 platen if I'm doing a large back print on that jacket I would have my pressure set at about a 4 then keep in mind I moved to an 11 by 15 for maybe a smaller jacket or a 6 by 10 for my left chest I am now isolating that print location and what's going to happen is the math of the 16 by 20 platen is crunching down onto a very small space especially when you go to that left chest and raise that print area and so you want to cut that pressure back so that your heat press is reading more of a light pressure so a 2 for me would be ideal that way I'm still getting the pressure it needs it's still going to feel like a medium pressure on that transfer it's still going to let it stick and stay but it's not going to over apply it into a way that's causing a huge scorch mark I will caution you that there are some applications that the fabric is just too heat sensitive to even 280 will leave a small scorch mark so it's volatile it will help to reduce it it may not completely eliminate it and that jacket may be one of those cases as well if that's the case you just switch I would recommend trying to isolate the print area to the size of the graphic with either a platen or a print perfect pillow which looks similar to the silicon material that's on your platen there and you can just tuck that into the garment as well what else do we have another viewer has ABN 20 printers and they'd like to know what would be the best material for them to use on tribal and garments with a ban 20 that's going to be the super tech products in the one-wheel you just applied to the tri-blend t-shirt super super tech actually comes in a few different materials but anything from that line is going to be two hundred and eighty degrees and perfect for tri-blend so there's no pig version for all of your color fabrics a matte clear version for your light fabrics and also some cool metallic options as well so if you want to add in metallic silver or white to the design you can do that all at that low temperature okay great so we were able to get that application then on the cheerleader shirt so that you guys can see trying to create a cool print there down on the left hand side of that application and using that lower temperature helps to again to significantly reduce any scorch marks that we would see with a higher temperature heat transfer so so far 280 degrees is the lowest temperature that the majority of fabric of transfer types will apply down at if you're able to go at a even lower temperature that would be ideal until the next price I'm going to apply is going to be cadcut glaze again cut on a vinyl cutter but this product does allow you to go down to 265 degrees and it creates a cool metallic effect on the garment if you have a garment that's going to be incredibly heat sensitive I would recommend that application but it goes all the way up to 300 as well if you're looking for that now this garment is a new one that's actually from Jay America and it is a hundred or a 95% rayon 5% spandex blend and so it adds a little bit of spandex to get that stretch and fift is aware looking for the rayon again is the concern because it's going to be incredibly heat sensitive we've taken any cotton or even polyester to fabrics that we know a lot about and gotten rid of it to create this garment it's incredibly soft it's going to feel great on the wearer but we have to again look for some low-temperature solutions when we're printing this item and so I'm going to apply this all the way down at 200 I would apply this down 265 degrees my heat press currently is at 284 all of my other applications so we're going to go ahead and leave it at the 280 but keep in mind 265 will allow you to have even more success in printing and so cadcut glades if you haven't seen this product is actually a translucent metallic so you'll notice how it's completely see-through and then it adds that metallic sheen to the item that you're printing and so I'm going to go with blue on top of this chill shirt just to kind of create a cool tone on tone effect there's a lot of things you can do with this fabric or with this material and fabrics whether it's tone-on-tone placing it on a dark shade to get a really vibrant metallic we're on a really light shade just to get some understated metallic Sheen's on the garment again I'm covering it with a cover sheet and I'm going to apply it down for 10 seconds at my 280 temperature this is going to be a completely cold peel so I'm going to let it cool down completely here I'm actually going to remove it from the press to give it some time to turn to cool down here we'll move to our next one will come back and press this application ok so while we're letting that cool down there I want to talk a little bit more about polyester so so far we have looked at try blend would share a mixture of cotton polyester and rayon we've looked at a polyester and rayon blend from Bella canvas that we printed with the down the side print I don't know we just looked recently at a viscose of a rayon I'm sorry rayon blend with spandex so it's cooled completely here I'm going to go ed and peel that back transfer the peel up there getting a little bit of lifting which can sometimes happen if it's not completely cool and certain sloth if you notice some lifting or areas where they're not getting enough tooled it if you pull it too early if it wasn't cool down you got to press this back down there let it recall always if you're peeling something you notice a little lifting maybe you peeled it too early or didn't get enough pressure on the application you can go ahead and cover it back up press it back down and then come back over it and peel it once it's cooled completely so we'll give that plenty of time to cool down I was a little bit impatient there and we'll move to our hundred percent polyester blend so these are just two more polyester garments that we're going to look at there are a ton of polyester garments on the market today they started in performance or in a team uniforms with a denier polyester and now most commonly polyester is used as a performance wear or a moisture wicking garment and we see them moved in throughout all kinds of athleisure trends this sweatshirt well looks like just a standard cotton sweatshirt here is actually a 100% polyester garment and a lot of the times decorators are using or manufacturers are using polyester or rayon or viscose is a way to be able to get some of these cool blends and textures that we're seeing very popular in the fabric and it creates the kind of unique look and feel on the item so again I'm going to load this onto my platen here dial back my pressure for my next transfer and I'm going to load on my transfer type this one's going to look a little bit different than the last full color transfer that I had this is actually a transfer that's called stretch listo and so this is perfect for those very detailed full-color logos so if I have a logo that's going to be a lot of detail that I want to print the digital transfer that we looked at earlier and the Titans logo isn't ideal for that to stretch lissa allows me to get that full color and that fine detail and this is something you wouldn't be able to print on your being 20 or your solvent printer this would be a transfer you would need to order so I'm going to cover this just to protect my polyester garment again the same principles apply I'm looking for a lower temperature this applies at 275 degrees for 15 seconds and it is a completely cold peel so I'm going to allow that to cool down completely there and once that's completely cool we'll be able to go back in there and create our print if you have a bunch of cold pill garments one thing to keep in mind is that you cannot always lay them aside press them all come back and peel them a little bit later and probably one of the most impatient people in the world when it comes to peeling transfers just because I love to finish I want you guys to be able to experience it and see it all - there we go so we're getting that stretch ELISA on there with the team Jenna again just another great option for a digital transfer lower temperature it's going to be perfect for those full color applications and we want to create something like that on a low tone a heat sensitive blank like this polyester sweatshirt and keeping in line with textures that one I had just printed earlier the next karma is again something that looks and actually feels if you haven't seen this and you're maybe attending a tradeshow this year or if you're ordering some garments in I recommend this one from J America it's one of their new cosmic hoodies and so this one this quarter zip actually has a feel that feels identical to cotton it's incredibly soft and nice fleece inside but again we're looking at 100% polyester here on the tag and so when I print something like this not going to print the same way that a hundred percent polyester does it's going to be much more heat sensitive but again I'm getting this really great texture on there so I'm going to go ahead and remove my 11 by 15 platen for this application it's actually going to be a left chest so this again I'm just switching out my platen using the quick change latch here dropping into 6 5 10 just follow those same principles I'm trying to isolate the print area as much as possible but if you remembered earlier I talked about how sometimes you can over apply too much pressure when you move to a smaller location and so I'm going to check my pressure here and adjust as I need to so make sure I have enough pressure for the transfer now that I've changed that platen but I don't want to overdo the pressure that's here that way I'm not leaving too much of a mark because although I'm only reading a 2 out on here it's still going to be like a medium pressure also answer to kick my heat press temperature up to 300 degrees I'm probably going to be a little bit lower temperature when I do the application but we'll go ahead and start warming it up here so for this application what I want to do is I want to talk a little bit more about special effects and so when I get a special effect like a glitter this is actually cadcut glitter flake or I have a request for a shirt maybe for monogramming or for a dance squad or for a cheer squad where they want to use 100% polyester garments or these try blends and they still want that glitter finish cadcut glitter flake traditionally applied at 320 degrees for 10 to 15 seconds sometimes 320 degrees is just is a little bit too hot of a temperature and so what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to do aq step process it's been approved and allow the glitter flake to be completely durable but it's going to reduce the temperature a little bit this way that I'm not over killing or over scorching the garment here start by preheating my item just to get some of that moisture and wrinkles out and then for my application what I'm going to do is I'm going to apply to 300 degrees or that lower temperature for 10 seconds I'm going to grab my cover sheet over here so so far very similar to the application that you guys know if you've used cadcut glitter flake or that I just recommended so we're just starting out again with that first 10 second hit still using my medium pressure at the 300 degrees I'm going to peel this carrier back and then my final said I'm going to recover this up and I can use any cover sheet there's no changing the chignon glitter places it has that textured glitter finish and I'm going to seal it for another 5 seconds at 300 degrees and so when I remove that carrier and I do this last step of three to five seconds it's going to allow the heat to move through that glitter material very nicely and still give me the extra heat that I need to cure it onto the shirt so sometimes just lowering that extra 20 seconds off of the item can really allow you to have success when you're printing glitter finishes onto fabrics like you see here and creating some different prints and finishes so always keep that special glitter flake application and your back pocket especially if you do a lot of polyesters or intend to do polyesters with this popular material so it's 300 degrees 10 seconds and a medium pressure till that carrier back and then cover and seal it for an additional three to five seconds to make sure the adhesive is stuffed down to the fabric I'm going to head over to the table here and just kind of regroup and talk a little bit more about some of the things that I want you guys to remember as you start to go into printing new types of garments in your shop and so the first thing that I made shorter to cover is that you absolutely want to make sure to choose a heat transfer with a low temperature application low temperature is as low as you can get it below 300 degrees is ideal most low temperatures heat transfers today will start at 300 and work their way down to 265 as the fabrics continue to evolve of course is going to be more heat transfers that I'm sure will enter the marketplace that will help to fit that place but look for a transfer that's designed to apply for that temperature don't just take your current transfers and adjust the temperature that's always not recommended because it probably won't stay as durable or won't apply the same way that you had hoped and so lowering that temperature is going to help for any heat sensitive fabric to become less heat sensitive and help to avoid scorching it is always a it's not always 100 percent guarantee as I guess I should say sometimes you will still have hard to decorate items like I had mentioned if that's the case you may want to look at some accessories just to isolate the print location that way helps to reduce any scorch marks that's seen on the garment or make it look less visible those are some tips they're for at all so when you're printing anything any thing you can do to remove themes or callers from a tri-blend or heat-sensitive blank like that is really going to help you become more successful if I go ahead and remove that press this extra six Eames it'll help to avoid them from having too much pressure and getting more gloss sometimes scorching happens to fabrics because of overpressure so keep that in mind when you're using your heat transfer that you're not over applying your pressure all the time I know some decorators that do that just because they want to make sure it sticks and stays if the transfers recommended a medium pressure you can feel confident in doing it at a medium pressure likewise getting those seams off there will help to ensure that although your print your press is reading out in a medium pressure if my seams are up there they may actually be getting a firm pressure because there's so much thicker than the bottom part of my shirt so they get a little bit over applauded and then did that can be achieved with those heat printing flattens like we just saw if you don't have interchangeable platens you can even work with heat printing pillows or print perfect pad to raise that print location as well lastly all of the transfers I don't think I mentioned this but all of the transfers I've shown here today the screen-printed transfers the digital transfers premium plus all of these are soft and they're lightweight and so we like to use the analogy when you're choosing the benefit of use garments is they're Finn they're soft or lightweight they feel comfortable to the wearer and so the last thing you want to do when you have something that's like a nice steak is to put ketchup on it so you don't want to take a transfer that's thick or rigid or heavy and place it onto the soft lightweight garment it's going to kind of defeat the purpose and so we want to look at something that's not only low temperature but soft so it's going to create the same feel that the wear is looking for and there are a lot of softy transfers in the market we've seen a lot of them here today and will help to make that a little bit softer you can really even get a soft feel with your transfer cuz I know sometimes heat transfers tend to just feel thicker when they have large coverage spaces so you can even play around with your artwork have knock out areas open spaces that allow you to have more breathability make it feel a lot more softer on the garment Center text all of that will help you to achieve that as well so that should help set you guys up with some success for printing tri-blend heat sensitive fabrics hopefully you guys have been able to pick up on a few things here today if you have questions you can head over to the stall TV forum also make sure to subscribe to the Stahl's TV blog as well where we always share tips on these types of things as well as trends and fabrics and all kinds of stuff to help you grow your business so thank you for joining me here today and I will see you guys next week", "-VgnfOAfPLQ": "hello-hello focus creators and welcome back so today I'm actually on just a mini vacation here and thought I bring my stuff like I always do so that I can share with you even on vacation so while in this vacation I am working with the Cricut infusible Inc I am doing this just so that I could test to see whether you need to actually use the t-shirt blank that you could purchase for $9.99 or whether you could use a Walmart or another t-shirt brand that's a cotton blend so before we get started let's like subscribe hit that Bell and once you do all of that let's go ahead and get started okay so we're gonna try this with an iron and it is 95% cotton and 5% spandex so you are supposed there between the fabric so that you don't so that the ink doesn't bleed to the back of your shirt so they give you a couple of pieces of like butcher paper to put in between so you have that you're supposed to use a lint brush I am or vacation so I do not have one so I am just really don't have the things that I need here but we're gonna try to make this work anyway so the next thing you do is prepare your shirt by earning it a little bit so I'm doing that my design is just mop opacification DIY this is nice sitting the way I want it to so I am just like with anything else I'm gonna go about three inches down so here is just my grass creation name so said you should have some feet on here help it transfer and you just need to put it down so then like I said they give you a few pieces of butcher paper over top of it shiny side down and then you would be using your ez press right here I'm gonna try this with an arm just to see how it goes and the easy press would be 40 seconds I believe so I'm gonna keep this on for a minute and we're gonna see what happens so I will come back after that minute okay so I did this in sections and like I said I was gonna do it for a minute each section can't get it real it works so it does work or alright procrastinators so now that we have done this I just want to give you a few little notes about how this all worked and turned out one I used an iron they recommend that you use the easy press two or above for these types of projects so an arm works you just gotta let it sit a little bit longer and your quality I think with the ink it may not be as good as it could be so that is the first thing let me show you I did this on an actual Cricut blank another thing you may want to take note of which I didn't think about I use the black background and then put the color on top that doesn't work as well as it would for vinyl so just something to make note of but the color is vibrant it is the shirt is a nice shirt it's a nice thick shirt but like I said it is 9 for this show so not sure if that's something you want to do or have in your budget if you just old one I guess that's okay the same shirt and this is a Walmart shirt same design as you can see it is much lighter but I don't know if that is because one I am using it on one I did not hold this one down for minutes so later in what you saw on the video I was holding it down for a minute so just be mindful of that some of this paper is white so I'm thinking that but some of the print will come out white it's the white doesn't matter it's gonna so if you're trying to put something on a dark shirt you just need to be mindful of that I put a love bug image on this blue you can barely see it so and I was thinking the white paper so that's just me thinking wrong so what I did was take that same image and try to use it twice and as you can see it's light right here but that's where most of the image came off on the blue so it would have been better on a white shirt so just again something to be mindful of and here's the one you actually saw me iron down so like I said you don't have to use the blanks and spend the $9.99 the infusible ink itself at least at the place where I purchase it a tube a pack of two is $12.99 a pack of four is $17.99 so Carrefour is more economically friendly but as you can see it works so and from what I've read about this they're washable you can do everything that you would normally do so hopefully this is helpful to you thank you thank you thank you for watching as always please

this summer do you me personally whether I'm chilling indoors or I'm outside enjoying the Sun on a walk enjoying Mother Nature whatever it is if I'm wearing summertime clothes I want them to be on point and something new something fresh everything here is comfortable easy to wear gives off a summertime vibe and affordable so a solid list right here I thought you guys would enjoy it these are all essentials to me I've got a lot of summer content coming but if you want to see something specific hit the comment section let me know exactly what you want to see and make sure you leave a like so here's how this is gonna work I'm gonna show you guys five styles but 10 items total two items pretty much in each category I guess you could say enough with all that though let's do it okay so the most important essential for the summertime is a nice pair of shorts so we're gonna start things off with the Nike woven shorts in a simple black and white color way these shorts are totally different than a lot of the shorts I've shown you in the past and it's something that you guys as well as me are gonna have to get comfortable with if you aren't already so these hid for $45 which I certainly think is a very reasonable price point they are a woven material which kind of looks like a bathing suit and just the look of it always kind of threw me off but I'm over it I got over it and these shorts kind of help me do that this is my second pair so once you get over that this is not a bathing suit and they are casual shorts that's step one step two is that these are very short and wide so they are baggy short shorts the inseam I believe is 6 inches on here which is really short but that's the vibe this summer man these are the vibe this summer there's a bunch of different colors this particular pair is great just because of how simple they are they've got that classic Nike logo embroidered on the left side they do have a mesh inner lining and then very similar New Balance has a pair as well these are in yellow if you want a little bit more of a color pop the material is slightly different it's more of a rip stop but it gives off that same vibe they are short and then they have a small logo on left side as well as the right when you're wearing a t-shirt you could probably only see the balance and the new is covered but you know it's there these are certainly a little bit more technical with that draw cord on the front they're slightly nicer than the Nike pair so short woven shorts are in the building for summer 2020 let's keep it rolling all right and where there are essential shorts you've got to have essential tees this is the Carhartt work-in-progress pocket tee in this cranberry purple color I love pocket t-shirts and I've spoke about this Carhartt shirt so many times I'm not even going to talk long about it but what makes it so nice for the summer is that it's lighter weight you know I like heavy weight t-shirts a lot I'm about to show you one in a second but the nice lightweight material on this one right here makes it a little bit more summertime friendly and then the added detail of the pocket and then the Carhartt patch on top of that just a summertime staple I've gotten so many of these and I'm gonna continue to do that you can get them on sale I'll be sure to link them for you guys down in the description make sure you get a unique color you know essentials aren't necessarily always black Navy gray white you have that stuff already I'm sure you already do get a fun color this one right here inline Carhartt this one work in progress here's the difference heavy weight oversized a little bit more affordable rugged lightweight colorful slim fitting a little bit more pricey and then next this is the Nike Club t-shirt and this is orange trance it's kind of like this mango color these hit for twenty-five dollars definitely an affordable option you can get some of them on sale this is gonna be a great combo that you will definitely see me wearing I love just the small minimal Nike logo here on the left side that's embroidered in their quality is average at best keep that in mind you know you're not gonna get a steal from Nike and have it be good quality it gets the job done but don't expect to be wowed I also got the Nike Club shirt in white and the only reason I got this one is because of the Nike logo there's about ten different color options this is the only one I've seen with two different colors on the logo and I just thought it was also unique and kind of gives it a little bit more of a throwback look just with that red swoosh I don't know but I went for it it was cheap finish line was doing a deal I'll link you for you guys next let's talk about some hats so I've got two different styles of New Era hats here I'm gonna start with the Red Sox first I'm constantly looking for the in-between of a fitted hat and a strap back unstructured hat I finally found it I don't have it in this video I'm gonna be releasing it soon under my own brand and I'm it's so perfect man like it is so perfect I wish I could show you guys the sample right now but it's not done yet you'll see it soon follow me on Instagram if you want to see it summer my win summer collection couldn't be happier with it anyway new era has this hat and it's called the 950 retro crown snapback unstructured from the Heritage Collection here is the deal with this it's unstructured has that retro vibe with the green under the brim which is really hard to find it's got the same type of brim that a fitted cap does however the rest of the Hat is unstructured so it does not have that reinforcement underneath the cap like this one does that I'm going to show you guys in a second it's really soft and that right there makes it a lot easier to wear it's also a snap back so you can adjust your size you don't have to worry about getting that fitted cap in and being like oh is it gonna fit me because they all fit different they all fit differently this was actually really hard to find so I'm not sure if I'm gonna be able to link this for you guys down in the description or not if I do find it I will the only thing I don't like is the new arrow logo there I don't mind logos on the side of the hats like that's where I put mine actually prefer it however I just never have liked the new era logo is that weird for some reason I just think baseball hats look so much better without that new era logo right there let me know if you guys agree so the fit is different it's got like a mid fit as opposed to this fitted cap which I might as well talk about right now so this is a Milwaukee Brewers retro classic fitted cap it's a 59 50 model but what makes this different than the on-field caps that you see at lids when you walk in there all those new era hats for the most part they are on field caps here's a few quick differences white headband gray under the brim and 100% wool the best part about them being wool is the fact that they will shrink I actually prefer that I want my hats to shrink you get that better fit when they shrink up just a little bit I'll show you guys how to do that soon I know I've been talking about doing a video about how to make your hats fit better I will trust me it's on my radar I just haven't done it this one in particular I just liked that throwback glove logo of this brewers hat I didn't have it so I went ahead and grabbed it so refresh your hat game this summer more cap content soon I promise next let's get into the kicks first very briefly this box should give away what they are I grabbed another pair of the classic airmax 90s this og rendition that they've done so well Nike props these are great this is really one of the best shoes that you can pick up this summer Air Max 90 volts there's a bunch of different colors that you can choose from I like the materials on here the comfort the fit the look the shape really this is just an absolute home run by Nike this box though not so much of a home run it's very narrow and they hardly fit not a big deal though the neon hits of this shoe just screams summer and because it's a classic it makes it essential this is a little bit of a loud sneaker but not by much the gray the white and the black they kind of offset that even though these are vibrant it's not a statement sneaker you could wear these every single week if you wanted to and you can still get them don't sleep on these because once they're gone you're gonna have to pay resale prices when Nike shoes go away there's a little bit of a weight and then prices go up it happens all the time and then next let me tell you guys something let me just talk real quick about this shoe you've never seen these on YouTube I don't think there's any videos I haven't seen anyone wearing them I haven't seen anyone talking about them I'm shocked this is one of the cleanest Nike sneakers to release this year I literally just stumbled across them and was like whoa whoa whoa what's up with those one of the cleanest Nike sneakers of the year man telling me so we got the Nike Vapor X TC NIT here's the deal with this shoe for one that is my definition of clean I see people throw out the term clean all the time there could be some crazy shoe with ten different colors on it and people that go that's so clean fine maybe that's your definition of clean in my opinion this is it something that is predominantly one color which is usually white and then a little bit of an accent color like that right there doesn't get much cleaner now there's a different colorway on this shoe there's only two different color ways that I've seen so far the other is a hot lava color white and they are not nearly as good in my opinion they're on sale you can get those half off a lot of you will recognize that soul it is the same exact outsole that's on the Nike easy - it's originally from the Andre Agassi airtec challenge - but a lot of you will recognize it from the nike Yeezy sneaker so the combination of white and phantom gray on here is perfect it really looks like an off-white or a cream color and then it's got this flying knit material it's got that Nike court patch which I love I can't dive too deep into these but if you want them I'll link them down below they fit true to size and they're on sale okay and then last up the one accessory that completes all of my outfits in the summertime if you see me wearing shorts you also see me wearing crew socks so when I having grabbed two different colors of the jordan dry-fit socks and they're exactly what I'm looking for if you're gonna wear crew socks they also have to be pretty good quality and somewhat thick then crew socks no good at least in my opinion the dry fit material on these Jordan socks kind of offsets that it's 22 bucks for a three pack which is a little bit pricey for some reason no one wants to break the bank on socks they see that you can get 12 pairs for like 10 bucks of the gold toes and you're like okay that's all I need I'm not gonna spend $22 on a three pack but man it makes all the difference they last longer they look better the more comfortable it's worth the investment and then also I got something from Tommy Hilfiger these are by far my favorite socks they're the perfect height it's the perfect material they've got that classic Tommy logo on both sides they're a little bit more affordable than the Jordans socks so I stack up on them I've been wearing these a long time in held up especially after a lot of washing they haven't peeled they haven't gotten holes in them they haven't fallen apart I also went ahead and grabbed a pair of their quarter length and this is new from me I really don't wear socks that are at this height I'll occasionally very rarely wear no shows so we'll see if these come into play typically if I want a sock this height I just kind of pushed down the crew socks so we'll see so make sure your sock game is not lacking this summer same thing with the shorts same thing with the tees same thing with your hats and your clean footwear all of that has got to be looking right this summer let me know what you guys are wearing make sure you hit the thumbs up for me if you enjoyed this video subscribe if you're new a lot of summer content is on the way if you have any questions about any of this feel free to

think is some kind of voodoo magic is involved but it really isn't it's it's a great tip for unshrinking your clothes obviously if you've had a problem with shrinking something in the dryer that you didn't mean to go in there you will want to know this tip I had this happen when I I found the perfect pair of comfy yoga pants at the Nike outlet and I was so excited about him and I loved him they were comfortable they fit right there long enough then I went to wash them and I had no intention of drying them but my dear husband bless his heart got ahold of the load of laundry and dried them and so when I took them out years of laundry intuition told me they were gonna be too short and sure enough they were about 4 4 inches too short now so I kind of wrote them off put them in the rag bag and then a reader asked me about is their way to unshrink clothes and I thought hmm you know what I had never thought about that before I did some research there's a very easy way to unshrink your clothes and it does not involve any voodoo magic all it does involve is some warm water I usually do this in a sink full of warm water but just today for demonstration purposes I just have a tub full of warm water and then your item of clothing that was shrunk in tension unintentionally I'm sure and then some baby shampoo whatever baby shampoo do you like and just you're just gonna do a cap full of baby shampoo to roughly a sink full of warm water and what this does is when you mix it up and put your garment in it it's going to relax the fibers so you want to put it in there submerge it and get it completely wet you don't really even have to soak it per se you just want to make sure a little bit of that shampoo gets in all of the fibers cuz that's what's gonna help to relax the fibers and then also the fact that you're getting it wet you're relaxing the fibers also and it's gonna allow you to stretch the item of clothing back to its original form so a word of warning this will not work for wool sweaters once you dry a wool sweater it is it's toast but you can make something else cool with it like a craft I'm sorry so you're gonna squeeze out and most as much of the water as you can you're not rinsing it you're leaving the baby shampoo in there I'm just gonna move this to the side and then you want to have two towels at the ready the first towel you're going to lay out the item that you're trying to unshrink and this is more just for drying purposes to get some more of the moisture out of it so all you do is just roll it up and give it a good squeeze get as much moisture out as you can unroll it move that one aside and then another dry towel to lay it out on here's where the unshrinking magic comes because it's wet and because you have used a little bit of the baby shampoo you should be able to stretch your garment a little bit so do it gently at first you don't want to like go crazy and stretch it then it's like way bigger than you ever intended it to be and then keep doing that until you get it to about where you think it should be in my case that they did shrunk about four inches so if you gently I gently stretched it on three or four times it eventually got where I wanted and then you just leave it leave it to dry I'm an impatient person so I actually set up a box ban on it to make it dry faster because I couldn't wait to see if it worked yeah but overnight a few hours especially if you live where I am it's very dry we dry very quickly and then take it up try it on and you'll be amazed at the ability you just had to unshrink your clothes I make sure you tell everyone you know because it's a great tip and they will love you for it and you can go to ww1 good thing by Jilly calm to get more information on this post and few more tips and pictures and hopefully you'll try [Music]", "uORwwMW3G44": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] nothing is as classic as the white t-shirt here are three of my favorites the first t-shirt is the budget option this option is fuss free and gets the job done even though this white t-shirt is a budget option you can't go wrong with uni clothes 100% supima cotton tee the supima cotton makes for a soft t-shirt that gets softer with each wash the shirt fits true to size and has a loose tailored fit being a budget option does leave some things to be desired uni clothes quality control isn't always the best a shirt sizing can be inconsistent and stitching can be untidy however at just under $10 these shortcomings can be easily overlooked as this t-shirt makes for a great addition to any wardrobe while the classic white t-shirt is an uncomplicated garment it doesn't mean it can't be innovative this white t-shirt from the swedish brand organic basics gets heavy use during the summer as their technical fabric allows it to excel on warmer days organic basics uses an innovative blend of cotton elastin and pure silver to create a technically better t-shirt the added to last day to add some stretch for comfort and the pure silver creates an antibacterial fabric that won't carry odors even on the hottest of days usually technical fabrics tend to wear stiff but organic basics makes one of the softest cotton t-shirts the t-shirt is well constructed using a taped collar and double stitched construction this t-shirt does fit a little slim so if you prefer a looser fit size up if you're in the market for the perfect summer t-shirt organic basics typically sells these for fifty dollars but you can save an additional ten dollars using the discount code in the description box below the best premium t-shirt comes from another Swedish brand asking ask it specializes in luxury basics without the luxury tax ask its shirts start with the mid weight weave Egyptian cotton creating an extremely soft yet durable t-shirt the best part is they have perfectly executed the tailor fit with over 15 different sizes to choose from quality is up there with the best of them thanks to the twin needle stitching and the use of a binded collar which ensures collars won't deform even after a long day of wear at $45 this t-shirt is an investment but worth every penny as t-shirts don't get much better than this I hope you enjoyed the look into my three favorite t-shirts as always thanks for watching and I'll see you guys in the next one [Music]", "QAFFZEgXcro": "[Music] so throughout my style journey one of the hardest things that I've had to deal with is finding white t-shirts that really fit well and this is a problem that many guys face you know you're not going to be able to find a t-shirt in a store that's gonna fit everybody the same way because everybody's built differently and everybody has different body types so to help you guys out because I know you've faced this problem as well I recently went to four different stores and I bought a couple variations of their t-shirts for different price points and I'm gonna go over the fit and what I think about the shirts and we're gonna discover who makes the best white t-shirt but before we get into it go ahead and hit that subscribe button if you have not done so already and also turn on notifications so that you get notified whenever we put out a new video here at gen-style now for the first store it's a classic that we all know and love and that is H&M we like H&M because the prices are very affordable and you know they have a lot of different stuff in there and they have stuff at different price points so if you're looking for something that's super cheap they're gonna have something for you to wear and if you're looking for something that's a little bit more you know expensive and probably better quality they also have something for you to wear now this first t-shirt that I got from H&M as you can see it only costs $9.99 so it was a really nice price t-shirt and the material feels really good and I think this is a really good fit it's a slim fit and this one isn't the most cheap t-shirt that they have they have a shirt that they sell for like five dollars this is the one for ten dollars and I got a size medium and just the material it's very stretchy it feels you know like a very soft cotton I'm kind of curious as to see how long this shirt would last after multiple washes because it is again from H&M and they aren't the known for the best quality while I was at H&M I also got this kind of I don't know it's kind of like a knit quality shirt it's it's a very different fabric I don't know if you can see that on there but it's a really interesting shirt because it's it's got this kind of knit feel to it and it's not it's a lot thicker than your normal shirt it's you know a really heavy material and it's it's a really good fit this is honestly I kind of think of this as kind of a more dressy t-shirt this is something you know you could tuck in and wear you know with dress pants or you could wear with you know some nice jeans and some nice chelsea boots it's just a really nice shirt and I really like the feel of it because it's this knit material and I think it's really nice and again hmm they have stuff at different price points so you're gonna be able to find something you know that's more affordable at like five bucks and that's gonna be the lowest quality cotton and then you're gonna have something that's 14 dollars which is going to be you know really heavy really thick and is gonna be I think a pretty decent t-shirt the next door that also has some pretty affordable stuff and this t-shirt was only let's see how much it cost this t-shirt was only four dollars and ninety cents this is from forever 21 it's a men's store and they have a lot of stuff in there they really aren't as big on men's clothing they don't have a lot of you know really nice stuff in there I don't I didn't think so I just wanted to pop in and grab some t-shirts just to see you know if the quality was worth it honestly I wasn't really too impressed with the you know quality and the fit of the shirt I think you could have fit a little bit more snug around the around the abdomen so it's Jane it's a good shirt I was able to get two of them for eight dollars which i think is a really nice deal but again it's not the the best feeling material and it's not the best quality the next door I went to is a store that I really never shop at I've never even walked in one until a few days ago and that store is Express ad express I was able to get this white t-shirt for twenty-five dollars it was kind of you know pretty expensive I don't know if you guys could see that because it's blurry but yeah this shirt came in at $24.90 it's really expensive and I think I'm going to take it back because you know just the quality of it you know doesn't feel the greatest one thing I do have to say is that I like the there's like a little express New York thing at the bottom of it if you can see that there it's really cool and I think it looks really nice and it's got you know good stitching but overall you know the feel of this this cotton it says quality and fit but I really don't think it's that great a quality or that great of a fit one thing I do like about this shirt though is you know the fact that it has that logo and then also the fact that around the arms it fits pretty snug so it's kind of a tight feel around the arms so it makes you look kind of more buff that's something that I like and guys the final store I went to Islam art I just you know picked up some simple stuff some stuff that I already had this is an older shirt that I had it's a it's just a Fruit of the Loom t-shirt it's really nice I like the pocket it's you know very cheap like three dollars but the only problem I noticed with these shirts that are from Walmart like these Hanes in the fruit of the Loom shirts is the fact that they over time they develop armpit stains really easily so you're not going to really you know get to keep these for a long time without having that yellow stain under the armpits so that's kind of a downside to it but other than that I mean I've never had these get holes in them they're very durable and you know they make great shirts if you're just using them for something like layering or something like that I think it's a really great option you know at that price point and the final shirt that I was able to get at Walmart is a just a plain simple Gorge t-shirt I got a small because the medium fits a little bit too big and I really like the the feel of this shirt it's a very soft material and it's a it's a great fit I think it's a really nice shirt at only $4 you really can't beat it and comparing this to like the forever 21 shirt which was also four dollars I think this material is way softer I don't know if it's gonna last as long but I think because it's from Walmart it's got to be pretty decent quality I think this shirt if you're going to look for just a simple t-shirt to wear around or you're just gonna you know be cheap with it just go to Walmart get some Hanes get some Fruit of the Loom get some George and then if you're looking for something more high-end more dressy I recommend that H&M knitted t-shirt because I think that has a really nice feel and I think that material that they used is very nice when they build it so guys that's today's video I hope you enjoyed if you did so please be sure to

of our products so today we're at stalls the leading manufacturer in the heat press category to show you how to heat press on a few of our top-selling fabrics so we've been doing our YouTube channel for about a year now and get a lot of questions about heat press so can we go back and talk about just the basics of what it is the press is basically a vinyl or a substrate that has a adhesive on the back then you're able to use a heat press and press to a garment so who's most likely to be your heat press customer when you're doing heat press you need to keep in mind that you're going for a low quantity quick turnaround he prefers vinyl doesn't really replace screen printing there so to speak but it does give you that capability of turning around on the spot or within a matter of a couple days what's the difference heat pressing on different types of fabric keep in mind time temperature and pressure is key cotton very resilient so you can use a lot of different times and temperatures with your synthetics you have to make sure your temperatures are on the lower side so you're not scorching that garment are causing and breathing it back so this way and you guys actually did a lot of testing for us on our different products and our different fabrications and we have a whole resource on our website which will include so today I have our 100% heirloom cotton our tri-blend and our Heather CDC so will you take me through the process of how each one keypresses differently absolutely okay so what we're gonna do today on this one on the hundred percent cotton is we are going to quit fashion come on but we're gonna try to keep the lightweight feel of the garment and the light no feel of the application in place so I'm gonna sleeve the garment get it lined up make sure we're on here straight which with the bell of canvas not being tubular sewn it's fantastic it helps us get it lined up there that's better so after sleeve in my garment I'm gonna go ahead and give it a quick press make sure that my temperature is good get all the wrinkles and stuff out of the garment I'm gonna place my fashion film on top make sure it's lined up correctly and what temperature are you doing so fashion film goes on at 320 for 15 seconds and it's a warm peel it will feel hard so next we're gonna do our Heather CDC which is 52% heirloom combed and ring spun cotton and 48 percent poly so how does that different than 100% so here we're gonna put Premium Plus on your product which will enable it to stretch as much as as the garment does and not hinder it it's very lightweight goes on under low temperature and we're gonna keep from scorching the product and can you tell me about the difference between this premium plus versus a fashion faux the fashion film is your all-around product your all-around products gonna go on just about anything and you know not give it a real bit stretch but the price point is correct your premium plus still out a great price point as a premium pride allows the stretch capabilities of the garment we're gonna give this one a couple of seconds before we peel because it is a peel warm to cold I'll peel it off and we're done so again great product stretchable with a good feel so finally we have our tri-blend which is 50% polyester 25% heirloom comes in ring spun cotton and twenty-five percent rayon so can you tell me what is different about this yes your try blends are very very popular and kind of taking over the market so to speak because of the soft feel you get with the synthetics and the rayon in the garment it's it's a fabulous product so with the rayon in in it as a tribal and it makes it very very difficult because the rayon burns and scorch is easier than anything else it gets that soft feel but then again you know we worry about decoration so what we've done today is we've added a lower heating element so we're gonna actually heat it from the lower side or the middle of the shirt and just kind of touch it up on the top so if we do have any scorch you know we do have any problems then it would be on the inside of the shirt and not the outside of the shirt so to speak the temperature on the top we're gonna do it at 250 to prevent that scorching on the bottom we're gonna go up to a full 300 degrees right we're gonna use Premium Plus which is our premium product of course premium shirt premium product this is a warm - a cool peel so I'm just gonna pull it off a little bit because again lower heating element and peel it off so to summarize on our 100% cotton lose the fashionfilm we applied it at 320 degrees for 12 to 15 seconds on the Heather we use our premium plus at 275 degrees for 7 to 10 seconds and on a tribe lens we use our premium plus 300 degrees on the bottom with using our lower heating element 250 on our top heating element for 7 to 10 seconds don't forget to subscribe for more content like this we come out with a new video every week [Music]", "iw7-opm0Z3U": "hey what's up guys artist dirty Donnie gillies here I have figured out how to fade a t-shirt we're going to a step-by-step and I'm going to show you how to film I have a few shirts here in the meantime please like and subscribe hit the belt you want to be notified when my shows come up Donnie TV [Music] in episode 44 of Donnie TV how to make your shirts avenge a lot of you asked how can I fade my shirt well I figured it out check it out there's also a link below to episode 44 if you want to make your shirts vintage so now you can fade them and make them vintage on Donnie TV so this is a shirt that I did this is one of many shirts I've done for the band Metallica I've done a lot of art for them I know that you can see it on my website through DICOM we're gonna fade this shirt I've already done this once and I faded a black shirt I'm gonna show you if you do it too much it's just gonna turn Brown figure out how to fade a shirt now I'm gonna try a quarter of a quarter of a cup okay so I've got 1/2 of 1/4 a cup of bleach I've got a half a bucket of warm water hot water I'm gonna mix it up really well fill the washing machine up with this solution then when the washing machine is ready to go I'm that's what I'm gonna dump my shirt in because I don't want it to get all splotchy I want it to be evenly dispersed we don't want that shirt to bunch up and get a white spot in it okay [Music] and now pouring in the bucket of water with the solution [Music] okay so this one came out amazing we're totally happy with this one we ran this through the system four times that's with 1/8 a cup of bleach each time this one came out amazing this is the old navy shirt same thing this came out great so the big fail on this was the Metallica shirt I call this a fail I blew it out this is a Hanes shirt now I used too much bleach on this I used a quarter a cup of bleach and I did it twice for some reason they went totally Brown it's I think it might be Haynes the brand's so when you do this I want you to be really careful and don't use your favorite shirts I would test it out on some maybe I mean Old Navy shirts work great this we don't know what brand this is but it's not Old Navy so it worked great on these - just be careful because if you put a really good shirt like this and you blow it out I can't help you there but don't use too much bleach the key is 1/8 the cup of bleach with 2.5 gallons of water and then you want to put that in with the hot water that's already inside of the washing machine [Music] we're gonna sing it relax we got the poster shop we got the t-shirt shop t-shirts posters we got stickers sticker packs all kinds of stuff [Music] you", "y8D9HWzg1II": "in this video we're going to talk a little bit about how to take transfer paper and turn it into a business into a money generating scheme at home or in an office using a heat press and everything else which you've been talking about in the other videos energy transfer paper domestic inkjet printers simple software to generate images so we're taking a transfer paper an inkjet transfer paper here's a printed one it is the same as the one that you use when you use an domestic iron of course you can't use a domestic iron when you're running it as a business if you're using it to make money because you'll be doing loads of prints in one go an iron takes a long time with the heat press we can do it in seconds just a very short talk about about the heat press we've borrowed one from a client of ours where in his premises and it's a working bench for for printing t-shirts we're using a very very simple quite an old clamp press so it just moves up and down like a crocodile's mouth all heat presses have very similar similar elements to them we have a hot plate which we've set to a hundred and ninety degrees and all heat presses have this soft rubber pad onto which the t-shirt goes and a pressure adjuster so a cost of these ranges from a couple of hundred pounds for a secondhand one to this is a small one a square platen you're probably looking at between four and five hundred pounds maybe even a little bit less depending on which model you go for it doesn't really matter as long as the heat plate can reach the required temperature which is an actual 180 degrees we've set it to 190 so that we're guaranteed the temperature that we we need so you can see it takes a really small place not does he don't need much more than a little table you can do it on the kitchen table it's not particularly heavy so can be moved from the kitchen or from your office to storage and then brought out again if you when you need to use it the way it works really simple we take a t-shirt we're going to print the front of it so we position it in the right place on the plate I take care to make sure that the color is right off the plate because that will reduce the actual pressure from from the area away which you're printing good practice is to give it a little press to flatten it out we're taking a transfer which wave pre-trimmed we've taken away all the excess white areas from around it leaving a three to four millimeter white edge this is just good practice to make sure that we we don't have unnecessary bits of transfer that we're transferring onto a shirt position it face down this is a light transfer paper for inkjet printers normally if you were doing it with the domestic iron you'll be working away for a minute and a half or so with this heat press set at 190 degrees we're going to go 13 so 13 seconds this press actually has a timer most presses that will have a timer in fact all of them will have a timer and this one doesn't work so I counted to 13 and here is a final printed shirt a lot of people ask us about silicon paper you will notice when you buy this transfer paper you will have some silicon paper in the in the pack silicon paper is really essential when you're using a domestic iron because once you peel it you will reposition the silicone paper on the exposed image and repress it with an iron just to make sure in case you've made a mistake that any errors are corrected and it gives the image a softer feel it's not essential when using a heat press but I like to use it anyway so we take a silicon paper these are reusable you get quite a few of them in every pack of paper and position it on the exposed image and just literally a three-second repress peel it away stretch it a little bit and there's the final article done cynical paper incidentally also and again this is this becomes a bit more of a business application if you these are promotional shirts for an exhibition for example you want to print the back of it you can protect the exposed image just by sticking the silicon paper down onto it and then you can see it's a it can be removed at any time and now if I want to print the back of the shirt say you've got an exhibition you're you're you want some promotional shirts and I've just made a really simple bit of graphic to go on the back again we're always trimming the excess white areas always good practice the more you can remove the better the result you don't need to be really fine antic about it but the more you remove the softer the the final result will be so really roughly cut around the image this is going on the back of the shirt same process face down 13 seconds okay and we disengage the press again no huge rush little stretch to pick up the transfer and peel it away adjust a reminder because everybody asks here's the original print and you'll notice that it's in mirror image when you're printing light t-shirts everything has to be mirrored because when you press the put it down face down on the onto the garment the mirrored text becomes the right way around remember the silicon paper will put on the side comes off anytime when you pray when you use the heat press also you get a slightly softer feel and the images will stretch without cracking much will be very very long living on the shirt this can be washed time and time again and becomes a commercial product so we've showed you how to take a relatively low-tech not very expensive piece of equipment a clamp press in this case with a hot plate on top a rubber the bottom temperature gauge you can take your ordinary inkjet printer with inkjet transfer paper this works both for light and for darker gamez we'll show you the light but we have dark transfer paper as well and the process is near identical and overnight you can create a money generating scheme you can sell these images on ebay you can provide a service on eBay or on Amazon or on social media for t-shirt printing services hen nights exhibitions people that need personalized one-off shirts do it mail order generate money a shirt like that one off yourself for 10 pounds your cost is under 2 quid", "8HErdHSZHMw": "okay it's Sunday it's raining what a great day for a deer what's that you're judging me for wearing the same sweater no how dare you I wore this no you're right actually you're right I wore this sweater two videos ago maybe I should make a new one what so everybody today I'm gonna show you guys how to make this type of shirt aka bleach tie-dye well it's actually all it's known as is bleach tada when I first debuted this sweater over on Instagram a lot of you guys were like did you make these and I never responded now is my response no I didn't I actually bought it like this however my gonna show you guys how to make your own nose is a very easy technique but it also happens very quick let's give you it I'm gonna show you guys exactly what you need for this craft where to buy the stuff I guess some recommendations cuz there are different ways you can do this but I'm gonna show you a few different ways this is how you make up bleach tie-dye sweater when you're making one of these shirts you need to pick the right color of clothing this was originally a navy blue and when you add bleach to it it goes to white but if you stop the process about halfway it'll actually stay a little bit pink blacks any dark colors Brown start Gray's dark colors or wear this DIY really thrives oh it's like a Value Village a goodwill and I picked up three different types okay so I got I got a hoodie it's a black hoodie just simple with a hood sort of hoodie is I got a t-shirts with just a simple design again it's black and I picked up a long sleeve not a hoodie plain long sleeve block again now I actually know how to do only one of the techniques but in this video we're gonna try different ones to see which one works the best it's gonna be so fun and then hopefully you guys at home can pick which technique you want to do it's very easy to mess up because you cannot reverse it it's best to wear clothes well doing this that you aren't afraid to ruin I'm already wearing a bleach dyed shirt so it's gonna blend in if I mess up second thing you're gonna need elastics say you're not are she's gonna need this many elastics I just have this cuz of past videos eight to ten we're doing a few shirts if you're doing one shirt you're only gonna need three let's just let's just go Bunch you're gonna need some gloves very important guys because we are using bleach you could pick these up in the dollar store these are just some plastic rubber gloves these are important because I'm working with bleach you want to protect your skin does this stuff will irritate your skin if you get in your eyes it's very dangerous and make you go blind so make sure you have some protection on your hands you're gonna need a squeeze bottle you get at the dollar store this is literally a squeeze bottle this will be in like the barbecue section as a dollar store you can also use empty squeeze bottles from so old ketchup bottles anything where you can kind of control the spray these are great units $2 in the dollar store and last but not least the most important ingredients some bleach I know this at the dollar store bleed or not as easy as this DIY is because we're using bleach I suggest you have help from a parents someone that knows the significance of what bleach can do I mean look what it does to a shirt and this is within minutes do this in a well-ventilated area that's all you're gonna need now that we've got over the materials let's get started step 1 you're gonna grab a piece of clothing that you're doing the bleach tie-dye with first piece of clothing is we're doing this hoodie lay down the hoodie flat on a table in a grab wherever you want the center of your bleached I die to be so wherever you want it's like warp in so for us I don't do it the center of the star grab it and start to spin and just keep spinning so it's kind of like this little cinnamon bun step number two well you're holding this all raveled up like this you're gonna grab it elastic you're gonna wrap it around so it's one cross-section here you do a third one that and yeah we'll do a fourth one so like that this is what your shirt should look like kind of like a sinner in bun or like a pie that's been cut so this right here is option 1 for bleached item and that's the way I know how to do it option number 2 - or - we're gonna take our long sleeve here the non hoody and we're gonna do it a little bit of a different way so we're gonna actually roll it and now we've got a little roll like this put elastics on it now okay - here this is option number two I don't done this before but I'm actually really curious to see how this kind of turns out this one might be like stripey or something on our own and I guess technique number three which I'm not really even sure what we're gonna do this let's do it let's do uh two spins let's just see what happens here [Music] bunched up mess but that's the whole point of this we're gonna see what happens one two three four and that is technique number three we have technique number one which was the cinnamon bun with a single twist we have technique number two which is like the sausage roll one two three four five six different slots and the shirt is just essentially just rolled up and technique number three two twists and just kind of a bunch of since this is where bleach comes in you're really gonna want to protect whatever you're doing this on so I'm gonna lay down some paper or like a liner of some kind go ahead and put on your gloves next step you're gonna take your squirt bottle and you're gonna fill it up halfway with water so since this squeeze bottle is eight fluid ounces we're filling up two for the mix is one for one half water half bleach go ahead and fill the rest with bleach and then close that back up and just kind of mix the bleach and water together step three you're gonna take a plate or a dish or something place it down technique number one with technique number one we have actually this pie cut what we're gonna do is we're gonna dye this section this section this section in this section so these for every other one now this reaction happens very quick ready set go [Music] [Music] well - now you're gonna quickly flip it over do the exact same thing again [Music] all right well that absorbs the bleach we're gonna do shirt number two which is the sausage roll let's go ahead and try this one one gift one two skip one [Music] three now we're going to rotate it and get the opposite side we're going to leave that you can already see it's already losing its color alright let's go ahead your shirt number three [Music] now just taking a quick look what we have you can already see this one has already lost a lot of its color and its pottage it's great this one kind of stop the hoodie I think we're done with this one we're just gonna let it sit for a little bit longer let's go ahead and take our hoodie first so I'll take the elastics off okay let's see how this looks not so good this one looks like spores all right it's kind of sick okay number one technique number two which I am hoping is the promising one totally orange it's crazy technique number two this one's kind of badass again the issue is the bleach isn't going all the way up but it it's creating this like fire looking that's our best one yet this one I didn't like the color turned out to be not bad now this one sucks man so once you have all your shirts out of the elastics you're gonna toss them in the shower and you're gonna rinse them all cold water [Applause] [Music] [Applause] velasca once you've rinsed your shirt in the shower or the bath that got rid of most of the bleach do they gonna toss it into the wash do a cycle where it actually cleans itself and then obviously put it in the dryer and then it's baked deaning it's safe to wear let's check out our results here oh damn baby this actually turned out kind of sick I gotta tell you this turned out much better than I thought it did I don't know if the wash did anything I think it did the wash kind of boosts in it oh man this is badass hell yeah and like died the hood as well oh man I'm gonna be honest there I was a little worried that this foot wasn't gonna turn out as good but I do think the wash helped it out a lot this one's sick man this is number one hell yeah oh hell yeah let's do shirt number two okay here's shirt number two turned out raisi orange this was the one we actually rolled up like a sausage and did the five elastic bands it's kind of cool you could see though the bleach didn't actually make it through all the way to the shirt but it kind of looks like one of those cool film birds or something so yeah it's kind of the same all the way around this is an exhale even though all three of these shirts started off black I think the original colors were like the base color of the black is different you can see the bleach on this one made it Orange like very orange every shirt will come out super unique so this is this one let's check out your shirt number three hey I got a look at this because I can't see on the camera I can't really even see what it looks like just yet but yes it made it more funny and you can see with this shirt the original color or like the base of the dye must have been I don't know white or something I don't know which one is my favorite I'm a huge fan of them all there you guys have it that is how you do a DIY bleach tie-dye shirt so you can add further modifications to your designs never just spray your shirt with bleach and just hope for the best you have to twist it you have to turn it and stuff like that there you guys have it no Sundays DIY if

glasses but I am struggling to see these days so I wear my glasses a lot more often I'm going to go back to the eye doctor soon and get now reflective lenses so that you just don't see my ring light be in my glasses but I gotta wear them because I can't see but I just started the camera on real quick because I want to distress some shirts today you know bleach em out cut some holes in them rough them up a little bit and I thought since they're kind of in style via Instagram right now that maybe you guys would like to see um I'm just going to just go with it and cut some holes and spray some bleach and stuff on it so I'm gonna do this tea here that I got from I think this guy's from H&M I'm pretty sure it's from H&M and I got it in a large because I wanted it to be long enough to kind of wear you know like as a t-shirt dress kind of and I do always wear like these kind of biker shorts type of things underneath people always ask like are you wearing pants and I'm like some kind of pant so I'm going to do this guy and if you're on the shorter side but you still want to give it like that oversized look but it's just like way too long for you what you can do is cut the bottoms off I'm going to leave the bottom because I am tall so I don't want to take any length off of it because it's already like when I put it on it's already pretty short anyways but if you are on the shorter side you can just cut the bottom of the tee off or as much of the tea as you need to adjust it to the length that you want so the most important thing you're going to need is a pair of scissors fabric scissors would be best just so that it's going to be a lot easier to cut the fabric as opposed to using like dull scissors or just like regular kitchen scissors so get you a pair of so get you a pack so get you a pair of fabric scissors and then of course you're going to need some kind of bleach I am going to transfer the bleach into this little maker forever our spray bottle that was empty and then I'm also going to take the lid off of one of these guys and just put it in the bleach and use it to spray just because I don't I currently don't have any spray bleach so to quickly transfer the bleach into this bottle be careful and then I'm working on just like a craft table that I don't really care if anything like happens to because we are going to be like slicing our t-shirts so we're just make sure you're not doing it like on your grandma antique table and you should be okay I'm just gonna lay it out and get it going if you don't feel super creative but you still want to make your own peace dress shirt just go on Instagram or go on Google and check out like distressed tees and you can just kind of pull inspiration from there or you can just like wing it and go off of your brain which is what I'm going to try to do so hey girl and if you don't have a spray bottle what you can do is take a bottled water poke some holes on the top fill that with bleach and then just kind of sprinkle that over your shirt if you don't have anything to you know can you people want to see you but if you don't have anything don't excuse me I'm about to de-stress this tea okay okay one moment to give you to pot to lay on how about you come over here in Lee all right so I'm just going to start by cutting the tea and we're going to start like here on the neckline so what you want to do is you want to pull the fabric up and like pinch it together and then cut into it that way so we're just gonna what this is going to be a bigger hole here and then as you see you have a hole and then what you want to do is like just get your fingers in there kind of pull it apart a little more so it doesn't look so much like I've cut looks you know like a rip like it's naturally there I just want to stretch it out little holes here suade all it's hard to see but I'm just kind of creating little cuts in the collar in when you're making your holes you just want to pinch it together and cut and then stretch it don't be scared to like rip it more with your fingers the whole actual hole I'll just give it a better like overall look miss you too I just got home from LA yesterday so she's little just a little more clingy when I come home and then what I'm going to do is take the sleeve and right where the line is stitch I'm going to cut right along there to get rid of this stitching here so that the seat kind of gets a little bit of a roll up to it so just try to cut as close to the actual stitch as you can or you going to cut off more like if you just want a little bit of a shorter sleeve and then so that you don't have that rough kind of edge you just want to give the shirt a tug so that it starts to so you see like the sleeve is like rolled up now we have to give it like a raw edge I like to cut holes down here on the bottom like along the edge because member I'm going to keep my actual seam here so I like some holes to be like in the mix so just very repetitive we're just going to pinch the fabric together and then cut it cut it oh got a little wonky on us it's all right just go with that little hole there okay that's a little better okay the shirt did switch but the other camera just wasn't picking up the distressing like this one was so what I do is I open my scissors wide like this this is going to be easiest way to de-stress your shirt and then you're going to pull the fabric and then scratch along the t-shirt this is going to give you a really nice distress mark and it's going to be a lot faster than just cutting little tiny holes if you want to go through and cut little tiny holes be my guest but this is what I do throughout the entire t-shirt and then one more time just pull the fabric taut and drag the scissors along it as you can see it's super easy and it creates really nice distressed holes just be careful with these scissors to not cut yourself I did end up cutting myself a couple times but it is a lot easier than like I said going through and cutting holes so let's go ahead and switch back to our Guns and Roses tee okay so here's my Guns N'Roses team once I finish distressing it I do think the easiest way is to just drag the scissors across to create your distress marks and then add little holes in between where you drag the scissors that's the way that I think is just easiest to do it and don't be scared to distress your tee you're not going to mess it up I promise you just kind of go with the flow and I promise that it'll turn out good so let's go ahead and move on to the bleach so I buy bleach just in a spray bottle I'm going to start with this for like light things the bleach it'll start to turn immediately this is just like mere seconds of the bleach being on the shirt alright so I got the bleach and a little dropper and as you can see I've just been kind of dropping it all over the shirt wherever I feel like it needs it so it's just a combo of spray bottle and just little drops and then you just leave the bleach on until you kind of get the desired color that you want out of it so I'm gonna let this change colors a little more and see how much more bleach I need to put on this guy I'm looking pretty good I'm still just letting a little bit of the bleach turn you can do the back if you want I kind of just let it bleed through so then you'll just have kind of like these little bleach marks throughout the back of your shirt but I mean if you want to de-stress the back be mad yes all right so now what we're going to do is we're going to go wash this bad boy in cold water to stop the bleach from activating any more than it is [Music] then you just want to let this guy hang and dry overnight and when you wake up I'll have a nice bleached distressed tee and here is the completed shirt about 24 hours later I couldn't resist wearing it I loved how it turned out I hope you guys do too if you do recreate this shirt please tag me on Instagram or Twitter I would love to see your

to tell you guys except I love you thank you so much for watching and until next time I will talk to you guys soon [Music]", "T0_HiVltKrQ": "so I heard about the british-based clothing brands Sun spell from a male fashion device thread about the best t-shirts there's a second most of good of Brandon the 55 $100 range so I'm pretty excited and I checked out the website and you know they had way too many photos of pale British Oxford types with beautifully coiffed hair I was immediately intrigued and they were British luxury and in big bold letters they said son spell played a little role in the birth of this the universal wardrobe staple the t-shirt a part of our heritage that we like to think gives us a certain expertise when it comes to knowing exactly what takes the best feature possible I mean England since 1860 Wow so they served in making t-shirts when Lincoln was still president they were making t-shirts more than 40 years before Ford made the Model T when Sun spell first started making clothing in 1860 they're gonna be people working there who could remember the Revolutionary War so I was imagining what kind of deep insights about the t-shirt that Sons ball had discovered in their whole process of making t-shirts for a hundred and sixty years so I keep reading lightweight ultra fine long staple pima cotton provides extraordinary softness comfort and lightness nice pink cotton I mean at $90 a t-shirt make it be using cashmere or silk no actually I'm telling you there's a company called Nodame nee-nee-nee dumb they make t-shirts from cashmere silk and it feels really really awesome but you have to hand washing and there's just is not enough time to do that [Music] so what's FEMA cotton so a cotton ball is may have a bunch of fibers and pima cotton is a specific strain of cotton where each of the fibers that make up the entire cotton ball is longer than normal which when you twist it into yarn makes it have a softer hand feel than short staple cotton or short fiber cotton and then finally they say made at the Sun spell Factory in Long Eaton England oh I'm 100% positive I've never worn something sung by someone with a British accent if I was an equation to get any crayon strong smooth fine cotton thread that what can go through being worn or bottom I think not positive that they're describing ring-spun cotton which is when you spin the cotton fibers into yarn that's super super tight and it makes it kind of fabric more durable so this is a one a hundred sixty year old British luxury and heritage brand - that helped birth the t-shirt and three is now using its expertise to make pima ring-spun t-shirts with a classic thing at ninety dollars that's a steal so I get the package and it feels good it's lightweight has a bit of the ring-spun stiffness as well as a bit of a roughness to it so it really does feel like a vintage t-shirt from the 50s something that you know Marlon Brando might have worn there's an imperceptible sheen which enhances that vintage look I put it on I like the fit it's on the boxers side but not Kanye and a little long so very much the classic fit there you know describing and then I notice the sleeve opening is a little bit on the tight side and it's weird it feels a little coarse around the neckline is that a hanging tagger no not the Hang tag but there's something sharp and rough like like uncut nails just going all around the neckline so as I'm fingering this in the neckline scene I noticed that the stitching feels like the stitching you would use for industrial grade tarp each of the stitches is coarse and sharp and I can feel each one of them poking at my fingers so in a normal t-shirt you ever seen like this it's normal nothing fancy and quite soft you don't feel it when was the last time you wore a t-shirt and complain what when si feels terrible but this so this is this is the the Sun spell neckline it's a it's a fancier neckline same I'll give it that and as a unique look but you can feel the stitches scratching your neck like the claws of a cat and then you begin moving your arms and you notice that they use the same kind of stitching in the arm so your bicep is getting cut up which is exacerbated by the fact that the sleeve opening is tighter than normal in my imagination when they were having the committee meeting to decide what kind of threat to use like I think it might have gone something like this hey boss so should we use normal cotton thread on this welcome it feels like they took the string that they tie burlap sacks with and got that British guy from Titanic to tighten it around my neck and arms I'm beside myself it is not like an unnoticeable detail this is something so clear this is something that is around my neck alright so you're probably wondering is it worth getting busy pissed off like is it really that bad okay fine I was going about my daily life it wasn't like I was obsessing over the scenes every single minute that's a lie I was okay when you're going about your daily life you might not notice it in every single moment but once you check in to see how it feels in the shirt as long as you have a neck and you have two arms you will notice the stitching and particularly perhaps oddly pissed off about the small little detail because some spell positions itself as not only luxury branding but a luxury brand with a hundred and sixty years of experience they're saying you should buy this 90 dollar t-shirt from us because we've been doing it for longer than anyone else and we make a luxury t-shirt that can't compare to all of your other shirts and yet this Sun spelled t-shirt is worse than your free t-shirt from like a crappy startup because it just I can't what I'm trying to say here is that one of the main selling points of luxury is their craftsmanship they choose the highest quality materials they have the broadest amount of experience and they obsess over all the teeny-tiny unseen details so that you don't have to go by the finest thread for sewing on even the back label not because that we're gonna notice but because that's the whole point of luxury craftsmanship and attention to detail even when we don't notice it's not don't get me wrong I get annoyed with luxury brands for all the same reasons that you do they mark its status to the wealthy and they push up lifestyle that's unattainable it makes everyone feel bad or tastes how ridiculous items like this $9,000 Tiffany's ball of yarn which apparently is what sun's values too so this neckline scene if by any chance this was interesting then check out our subreddit where there's more reviews and essays on clothing and if you'd like maybe even subscribe to us on YouTube", "rGcWCJXsUSo": "[Music] yo what's going on everybody I'm going to be reviewing and talking a little bit about Bella Candice I don't typically use Bella canvas I've never even tried it on before so we're gonna be travelling on today comparing it to other brand names like next level all style stuff like that so let's go and I'll put a link in my description on wherever mom said and I don't know you can buy these or maybe you can buy them you know retail which might be a little expensive but you can also buy them if you have resellers license they give you - a little cheaper yeah so anyways but I'll be very honest I'll be very frank almost exactly like the shirt that I have on the shirt that I have on is a next-level t-shirt blend 6210 but I really like the feel of this now the biggest difference I've already seen with this shirt the material feels safe but the coloring is different now let me show you an example we hold these up against each other there's a big comparison between the two right these are obviously two different grades I would say that the one above has more of a green tone but this is you know the fellow canvas is in in this color in particular and I've noticed with some of their other colors that I've seen online is that their colors a lot more solid you know compared to this now this seems a little bit more Heather but you know for me I like the really solid colors like this color is really nice all in all they're almost identical colorful collar and I know you guys can't feel it through the video but you know the material is almost spot-on I wouldn't be surprised if they're actually owned by the same people so justice skipping over really quick here or this one is all style and then this one here is next level now you know all styles typically are give me a couple dollars maybe like a dollar you know at the most like two dollars for a double extra-large but you get what you pay for so if you guys can see this all style t-shirt is kind of an old shirt it's kind of been through the wash maybe you know X amount of times you know I've sweated in this thing before and the color gets pretty jacked up and just the overall t-shirt it doesn't it's not you know made for like sports or anything like that you can't really breathe too much in the shirt like this but you know the shirt like this next level the color I have washed this thing crazy amount of times you know and you know the color is still really good so now after all that I'm gonna be trying some of these on yeah this t-shirt seems to fit me pretty well and the sleeves don't really go up into the elbows and they're good in the length I can actually feel that they're pretty good in length and then that's typically one of the worst things about buying t-shirts sometimes you might find the best fabric out there but then sometimes the length of the t-shirt is just terrible right sometimes they're too high and stuff like that now I'm gonna try on the second one too which is an extra-large alright so Wow I'm loved besides but then again I haven't washed and dried it to fit the size the material is great I would I recommend getting these and the material is awesome alright so that concludes the end of this video I mean the biggest thing that I've learned from this is that you really get what you pay for you know not not always the case but most most of the time you get what you pay for you know the the teachers are gonna last a little bit longer they're gonna have better material stretching material right I have a lot of people that buy my clothes and a lot of them are really active in sports and I'm saying love this type of material because you know it lasts longer you can breathe through it but again this is a highly highly recommend belly canvas three zero zero one you guys better go get your teachers now sub like comment subscribe if you guys got any questions let me know I'll be happy to answer alright guys [Music] see Bella Candice three zero zero one and it's this package that I'm talking about right here so that was bad that wasn't a good one", "FXLO8Lt-enc": "hi guys it's Emily from shower and I'm back with episode 2 of closet close-up I'm so happy you guys liked the first version of this series that I did on the most comfortable flats that money can buy I was super excited for the series but I'm glad to see that you guys feel the same way that makes me really happy if you are new to my channel and this is the first video you're watching and you're kind of confused this is a series that I started called closet close-up and it's basically me sharing with you the pieces of clothing that I think are high-quality investment pieces or kind of like wardrobe staples like white tee shirts flats leather jackets that kind of thing and I've tested a bunch of different brands and came to the conclusion that this specific brand is like as best as it gets so today's episode is on it the white tee shirt which I'm wearing today I'm super excited because I actually feel like this is a category that I've tested the most I have had so many white tee shirts in my life and why t-shirt seems like such a basic thing like oh you got any old white tee shirt and whatever but I actually think that it makes such a difference when it's like a good quality well fitting piece it's just like I don't know it just makes that whitey shirt look a million times better and all of the sudden when you wear with literally anything your outfit just looks so good so I'm super excited to share with you guys what I think of as the best quality white t-shirt as it gets so if you've seen a lot of my videos before you know how much I talk about James purse I don't hear literally anyone else talk about this brand ever I think it's such an underrated brand I happen to cross it because they had a beautiful store in Malibu when I was in LA one time and I just popped in I was so intrigued by like their beautiful store layout it's really like beachy California vibe and then I bought a few items and they lasted me so long they last me four years of college and they were like just some simple t-shirts and I was so impressed with how well the wear kept up even with the millions times that I wash and dry them so that was kind of my introduction to the brand the brands aesthetic is very minimal it's a lot of like basics so a lot of different cuts of t-shirts and tank tops and shorts everything is made with really natural high-quality fibers like really well-made Cotton's and really well-constructed just simple pieces so I love the brand and I cannot recommend them enough so I'm going to go into the specifics of why I think this white t-shirt is a really high-quality item for context you should definitely check out my what to look for in a high quality piece video and I'll link it up here and I'm also going to link it in the description that will give you a really in-depth overview of what I look for when I'm looking to invest in a certain item but let's just go through for this white t-shirt in particular how I can tell that it's an extremely extremely high quality item that's really worth the price okay so the first couple things have to do with like the fit so I just love this basic crewneck white t-shirt fit that James purse has totally mastered I think the sleeves are cut at the perfect like length of my arms I like how they're slightly angled so they go up a little bit and there's a little bit of a gap there not too tight on my arm and they're not too loose I also think that this neckline here is really well constructed well constructed it has quite a thick hem and it just feels like it's laying at the perfect place on my collarbone and it's also a really straight cut down I'll go up a little bit it's like a very straight cut town but it's still pretty flattering on like a woman's body when I'm late when it's laying flat on like a flat surface it does look pretty straight but it has the perfect amount of give where it just kind of sits really nicely on my waist and nothing is tugging nothing is too loose or too tight I love the fit of it as far as the material goes it's 100% and it's a really really thick material so it's not sure at all it's super durable and really really soft feeling on my skin and I just know that I could wear this with anything I could even wear this with like black bras and the black doesn't show through the shirt that's how thick it is and it's so hard to find white articles of clothing in particular that aren't sheer and it's been nearly impossible for me up until this point which is why I really really recommend this brand in particular another reason why I'm so loyal to James purse is because of how it wears over time if you buy cheap t-shirts from anywhere else like Zara or H&M or I don't know forever 21 which I've done many times in the past after you wear it and wash it like once or twice all of the seams go completely crooked and if you laid a flat the seam would go whoop and it would lean way towards the front and it just looks really really cheap and that's like one of my biggest pet peeves when I close comes to clothing is when it doesn't look the same after you wash it as it does as it did before and with James purse you can wash it and throw it in the dryer and it comes out looking exactly like it did when you threw it in there the first time my um the couple of t-shirts I buy think I like three t-shirts in different colors back in 2010 actually it might have been like I think I bought them when I was like in high school or something I no joke were them like three times a week in college every week I was wearing them like multiple times a week I washed them every single week and at the end of college they still looked pristine that it's insane the way that these items hold up and ever since then I've just been a hundred percent loyal to James purse so I have tank tops from him I have um this white t-shirt and when I'm ever looking for basic tops that are like cotton tops I always choose James purse over any other brand okay so let's just be real about the price this is a really expensive t-shirt it's a white t-shirt and it's super expensive James purse goes upwards of $100 for pretty much every item that they put out there and yes that's a lot of money for a t-shirt but this is my philosophy on my closet in general and my wardrobe in general I like to have fewer better things so if the white t-shirt is something that I see myself wearing um every week I am happy just to have one white t-shirt and wear that one white t-shirt multiple times over then have 10 cheaply made sheer horrible quality t-shirts okay that's a little extreme but 10 cheaply made t-shirts that I can kind of rotate it in and out and then throw out after three months have gone by like I plan on investing on in my basics because I know that those are the pieces of clothing my wardrobe that I wear the most and then the cost per wear actually becomes a lot lower if you do the math so t-shirts and flats for example in my last video these are things that I wear consistently over and over again so I don't mind making the investment in those items now keep in mind what I'm talking about investing in these stable pieces this t-shirt is like the most basic cut as it gets this is like a classic crewneck white t-shirt cut when I'm looking for more trendy things like maybe I wanted a cropped t-shirt or like a tight stretchy tank top um with like low V or I don't know something ribbed with like ruffles that's why like those are white t-shirts that are a little bit more trendy they're not like the basic staple so those I honestly don't mind buying it like cheaper trendy or stores um like brandy melville or something just because like those are trendy items they're not going to be in style forever and that's why I still keep some of those in my closet but don't choose to really invest that much money in them okay I have another brand name dropped out just a little bit just to get your thoughts talking to you guys in the comments and I want to hear if you have in these pieces below so brands that I tried and didn't like the quality of their white t-shirts include hmm forever 21 zara unit glow surprisingly is a really good brand i love you to go for a lot of different things but they're white t-shirts didn't make the cut for me i'm mainly for fit reasons i've also tried ever lane which is brand that i really respect and i really like and they kind of branded themselves on cutting the cost so that you're not paying that much money but you're paying for really high-quality item so I like when crazy and bought a ton of t-shirts from them about like who maybe two years ago and they didn't last they were they were cheap and I didn't end up really liking them so um every Lane didn't work out for me and then James purses just always worked out for me brands that I'm curious about that I haven't tested include are you am I or are you Amy are you am I that's roomy Neely's kind of fashion brand um I see her clothes on a lot of celebrities and it just makes me curious to see if they're high quality or not so I'm curious to see if those are good investments let me know if you own any are you a my clothing chemist in the comments below and then another brand is kind of known for their quality basics is tea by Alexander Wang I haven't tried anything from that line before but I've heard really good things so let me know down below if you swear by tea by Alexander Wang I'm kind of curious about that too but yeah so that was my second episode of closet close-up I hope you guys like this you were probably suspecting that I would talk about this brand if you've seen it literally any of my other videos I wear James purse um tops with a lot of different things so let me know all of your thoughts in the comments make sure you like this video if you liked it and if you're new to my channel I would love it if you would subscribe I'm doing videos all the time I'm just like pumping out new content constantly and I'm having fun with it so I'll see you guys in my next video bye",

heat transfer paper. While similar to light heat\ntransfer paper by relying on the white or brightness\nof a poly-based substrate, sublimation paper provides no\npop out feeling when transferred. The dyes on sublimation\npaper are the only portion being permanently heat\ntransferred, and they also have excellent washability! To print onto sublimation\npaper, all you\u2019ll need is a sublimation printing system. Before printing however, make\nsure that the image is mirrored, which is typically done by\ndefault through sublimation print manager software. The best way to apply sublimation\npaper is with a heat press. Their large heating elements can\neasily cover standard paper sizes. Setting up your machine for\nsublimation will mainly depend on what type of substrate\nyou\u2019ll be pressing. Our Heat Press Cheat Sheet\nincludes go-to settings for many popular sublimation blanks. When the machine reaches\ntemperature, we\u2019ll first pre-press the T-shirt to clear out any\nwrinkles and moisture. We recommend placing a\npressing pillow in or below your sublimation garments to\nreduce visible press marks. Next, place the paper facing\ndown on the shirt and make sure it stays before covering\nit with parchment paper. And now we can press! Using adhesive spray or\nheat tape can allow sublimation paper to really stick\nto a substrate upon pressing. When the machine is done,\ncarefully remove the parchment paper so as to not slide the paper. The dyes may still be\nactive just after pressing. Allow the transfer to \ncool for a few moments, then peel the paper out,\nand you\u2019re all done!

fashion blogger be beautiful and I love to give a twist a fun twist to all my shows every once in a while today I'm going to show you how to redo your denim shirt you need very simple ingredients for this DIY denim shirt a kitchen spoon gloves bowl full of salt powder dye a bucket of warm water about one-quarter full so here I go I'm putting the salt into the bucket this is the dye I'm going to only put a half of it currently I want to see what sort of color I get and then I'll decide whether to put the rest or not I'm using a kitchen spoon to do this but this is strictly for my DIY so don't use your kitchen spoon and then use it for cooking beware there to be honestly it looks like quite a fatal pink right there so I'm going to go ahead and start this today I'm going to dye the bottom I think it's just more fun I like the look of denim on top and then suddenly you know as a surprise element there's some pink underneath I'm going to leave the sleeves out you could even do this you know you dip your entire shirt with the sleeves in but I'm going to leave the sleeves off my shirt out and just dip the bottom I'm using the spoon because I don't want to get my hands in it make sure this the shirt is soaking completely in it you don't want to leave patches or a blue denim patch right there you can be as uneven with you as want even if if you want you know you can just have splashes of color on your shirt it's fine so don't worry about being neat or getting like a line of color it should be a little you know a little sort of uneven and that's how it looks nice I think I have my shirt pretty soaked there so now all you have to do is wait for about ten minutes and you leave it there to hang while you go to something else so as you see it's been ten minutes and our shirt is ready make sure you hold the sleeve so when you're pulling the shirt out because you don't want to get any splashes on the sleeves as you can see it's done it looks very very pretty with the pink on it and now you have to leave it to hang but make sure before you wear it you actually rinse it in cold water because you don't want to get dye on your skin so it's better that you wash it one time before wearing it so the denim shirt is ready it took about a couple of hours to dry it and I think it looks gorgeous the color is a little Pinker than I expected it to be but I think that's fine a little bit of trial and error there or when it comes to DIYs but I thoroughly thoroughly enjoy doing making this shirt and doing a makeover on the shirt and if you enjoy this video as well then

buy you don't so what do you do there are a lot of sewing tutorials out there including mine showing you how to sew them if you if you know how to sew but what if you don't I'm getting a lot of people asking and wondering what they do if there's a method so I've been trying my I've been looking and trying other tutorials online using bandanas fabric folding no sew stuff and I'm just not liking how they fit they're bulky it's they don't fit around the ears and you have to wear elastic I'm John Howell from you make it simple calm and in this tutorial I'm going to show you how to make this DIY face mask no sewing upcycle t-shirt is all you need and five minutes let's do it the only thing you're going to need is a t-shirt the bigger the better you want it to be at least 16 inches wide and a rotary ruler and cutter if you have one if not you can just use scissors so to square off that bottom piece and flip my t-shirt to the side and just get a square and even cut on the bottom edge [Applause] the next thing we're going to do is just cut to 1 inch strips for the ties for an adult mask I'm going to cut an 8 inch strip for a child's mask 6 inches and then for a teen 7 inches so as you can see I could get another another see how this is an angle I'm just going to quickly wear off the edges there on both sides so this will make two masks two adult masks this is about so this is 17 inches you don't want to go any less than 16 inches so take your strips that you cut for the ties and just cut off the scene these are 20 inches which is plenty you can have the ties be 16 to 19 inches because when we pull them they're even gonna get longer so when you pull these little strips they're going to curl and make some really nice comfortable ties those aside we'll save that other strip for the other mask good I'm going to show you how to make out of sleeve so I'm going to pull it to kind of stretch it and you can see how it's curling to the inside that's where I want my the inside of the mask to be I'll face that up facing up and take a strip and measure about four inches just eyeball it four inches from the edge lay your mask or your strap there and another one on this about four inches in I'm going to fold that over and over again and you can always depending on how wide you want it to be on your face you can adjust that at this point so just make sure they're overlapping a little bit and this is the top of the mask so I'm just going to take the ties and make a knot close to the end as possible and then this will be the top which goes over your nose and these will go behind your head so I'll take the mask and place that just on the rim of my nose put this on top of my head and take the strings that are dangling down at the bottom and just pull and it will cinch it and you just adjust it and cinch some more just adjust it on your head where it feels comfortable and pull it behind your neck and tie it just take a minute to adjust it if you want this to see how nice it's like there's no gap down here it's comfortable on the nose and the cheeks it gathers up nice you have three layers the top layer and the two folds right here and if you really wanted to make this tighter under the chin you just take the grab underneath and pull the fabric in a little bit what you really don't have to do but there we have it the most comfortable mask I have ever worn [Music] take your sleep you cut the straps about four inches from the edge now you're not I'm gonna gather this up a little bit and tuck it in the sleeve it's ready to go on your face so this is the one made from the sleeve hold that over your nose put it over your head take the bottom straps and pull at those and in seriously comfortable mask out of a sleeve or the t-shirt I almost like the one made from the sleeve better there's more layers and I don't know it's comfortable they're both comfortable so get out your t-shirts no excuses don't so you got this make sure you're

haven't noticed the theme of this video i'm trying really hard to be this devil may care cool girl well new life who this you", "xQLuPSE69Ao": "- Hey, everybody! And in this video I'm gonna be revealing five mystery T-shirt designs\nthat made over $100,000 on Teespring or the very\nsimilar website, ViralStyle. Not only am I going to reveal\nwhat these T-shirts are, but I'm also going to\nexplain why they sold so well so that you can help take these lessons and create your own successful designs. Now, my last video on\nTeespring turned out to be pretty popular, so I suspect a lot of you know what Teespring is, but\njust in case that you don't, Teespring is a website\nwhere you can sell custom, print-on-demand merch that you create, with the most popular being T-shirts. Once you sign up, which is free to do, you can then create\nyour own custom products by uploading an image file. You then in add in a product description and set a price. It's like having your\nown website where people can purchase your shirt from you, but of course, you don't\nhave to pay anything to list and sell it. Then, when a customer comes to your page and purchases the T-shirt\nfrom you, Teespring will then print your image onto a T-shirt and then ship it out to\nthe customer for you. Best of all, they will\ndo this automatically without you having to do anything. In the industry, we call\nthis print-on-demand. Now, for many people that's not actually the best part about Teespring. The best part for some\npeople is that to sell an item on there and\nto make money doing so, you don't actually need\nto have a credit card or any start-up money. That's because when you\nsell a T-shirt on Teespring, what they'll do, is take\nthe money that the customer pays, remove the cost of\nthe T-shirt from the price and pay out the difference\nas profit, like a commission. They have multiple payout options. You can have it paid out\nto your PayPal account or a worldwide Payoneer account. So obviously, all of this is pretty cool. It allows you to sell\nproducts and make money without having to spend any money. But, it does beg a couple of questions. Question one, what T-shirts should I sell? And question two, how should I sell them? And I think those are great questions, so in this video we're gonna be looking at previous case studies and examples of successful T-shirts that sold hundreds of thousands of dollars on Teespring. But that's not all, because\nwe've had a huge influx of new subscribers, I decided to introduce some to a staple here at this\nchannel, which is quiz videos. What I'm gonna do, is I'm\ngonna reveal one T-shirt to you you have five seconds\nto guess how much money you think that this T-shirt made. Play along and see how\nmany you can get right. All right, here is mystery\nT-shirt number one. How much money do you think\nthat this made on Teespring? You have five seconds to guess, go! (cowbell timer tings) (high-pitched bell dings) All right, drum roll please!\n(drum roll drumbeat) The answer is that this\nT-shirt made over $200,000. Yep, this T-shirt design\nhas made it's creator over $200,000 on Teespring, which is pretty incredible. But how did he do it? Well, he followed that exact same method that I talked about in last week's video. He used the Facebook Fan\nPage plus Teespring method. Best of all, this T-shirt\nhere, it's just one example of a successful design that\nhis Teespring store has had. It's made hundreds of\nthousands of dollars by selling a big range of engineer\nrelated merchandise, thanks to this Facebook Fan Page. So here it is. Now, yes it's pretty big at this point, but even when it was just\na fraction of it's size, it was making money and in fact, it's been making money consistently\nfor years and years. It's built it's following in a simple way, by posting funny pictures that\nare relevant to engineers. Funny pictures and pages\nare one of the easiest ways to grow, because people will often share the posts with their\nfriends and best of all, tag them in posts. Now, over time this page has\ngrown organically for free as a result of consistently\nposting funny pictures that engineers like. Now, he usually posts\nabout two pictures a day and this keeps your audience engaged and as you can see, he also advertises the products in the post\nand because of the fact the pairs it with a funny\npicture, it gets huge engagement and advertising for their products. Now of course, building\nup a niche social media account like this is not\nan overnight strategy, but that's okay because\nit is a free strategy. As I said before on this\nchannel, if you want overnight, fast, free\nmoney then you need to be prepared to pay for traffic\nand I will be showing you an example of a fast money\nmethod later in this video. But if you want a free\nstrategy to make money, then this is a great one. Build up a social media\nfollowing that focuses on a group of people that are highly passionate about something. In this case, engineers are very dedicated to their professional careers\nand are extremely passionate. And then, once you have built\na social media following, you can then use it to\nlaunch and sell products designed to appeal to\nit over and over again. Honestly, this is pretty basic. It's not rocket science to\nsee why this works so well. But, even though there are\nliterally countless examples of people who are doing this successfully, I still had people asking\non my previous Teespring video, \"Hey guys, does\nthis actually work?\" And whenever I saw a comment like that, I'm not a good person because\nwhat I was thinking was, gee, let me think about that for a moment. Does building a niche\naudience online of people who are passionate about\nsomething by posting great content that they\nlike and then using that platform to share\nproducts that appeal to this audience, does this work? Because even though\nthere are lots and lots of examples of people who are successfully doing this, I'm still not actually sure. If this whole, take time\nto build a dedicated social page about a niche\naudience and then post great niche-specific\nshareable products on there that the would actually like. I'm not sure if this actually works. (deeply inhales) Well, if you're still\non the fence about this, then take this video as your answer. Yes, if you're dedicated\nto this and don't treat it like an overnight gold rush, this does very much indeed work. If you're looking to follow\nthis strategy for yourself, but you're not sure what\nniche audience you should build up on say, Instagram\nor Facebook or another social media page, then\ncareers can actually be a great source of inspiration. For example, here's one of\nmy favorite Instagram pages, which yes, also works\ngreat with this method instead of a Facebook Fan Page. This page is all about accounting memes. You know, I'm not even an\naccountant, but I have friends that are and they love this page. And as you can see on Social Blade, they are growing rapidly\neach and every day. They plan to launch merchandise soon and if they do what the\nengineering memes page did and create a great design,\nthey will be successful. And here is another example\nof a career-focused design. This nursing T-shirt was\naimed at a very specific type of nurse, an OB nurse\nand it made well over 50 thousand dollars. And this T-shirt here for math teachers, well, this one made over\n50 thousand dollars too. And by the way, if you are\nenjoying this video so far and you have learned\nsomething and you would like to learn even more about\nmaking money online, then be sure to subscribe and click that little notification bell\n(bell dings) next to it so that you\ndon't miss out on any of our videos. Did you guess right? If so, congratulations. If you didn't though,\nthat's okay because we've got another chance for you to win. It's on to mystery T-shirt number two. All right, here is the T-shirt. How much money do you think\nthat this design has made? You've got five seconds, go! (cowbell timer tinging) (high-pitched bell dings) All right, time's up! Drum roll please!\n(drum roll drumbeat) This T-shirt made over $400,000. And it's such a simple design! It's mostly just text\nwith a simple graphic of a football that you could easily find available for free! So why did such a simple\ndesign that anyone could so easily replicate sell so well? Well, this T-shirt is actually in a niche where simple text-based\ndesigns with great slogans that appeal emotionally to the customer actually sell well and\nthat's because the number one thing in life that parents\nare passionate about is their kids. So it shouldn't come as a surprise then, that this similar T-shirt\nthey created aimed at mothers of kids that play baseball\nmade well over $100,000. And this design for\nmothers of soccer players made over $50,000. And fun fact, unlike\nmost places in the world, here in New Zealand, we actually use the same terminology as the USA. We call this soccer and\nwe call this football and of course, we call this rugby. RIP the All Blacks. Anyway, back to the video. Did you guess right? If so, congratulations! If you didn't, it's all\ngood because we've got another chance for you to win. All righty, here's mystery\nT-shirt number three. How much money do you\nthink that this one made on a Teespring clone\nlike website, ViralStyle? You've got five seconds to guess, go! (cowbell timer tings) (high-pitched bell dings) Okay then, drum roll please!\n(drum roll drumbeats) The answer is that this\nT-shirt made over $200,000. The question then is why? Well, there are two\nmajor factors as to why this T-shirt and it's product variations sold so well. But first, we wanna go and take a look at where this Teespring store\nmanaged to find it's customers and surprise, surprise. It's customers came from Facebook. Here is this store fan page. They have tens of\nthousands of fans of people in the hunting niche. Now, this ad promoting this\nT-shirt did incredibly well and it's not hard to see why. From the comments you very\nquickly get the impression that people are taken aback\nand pleasantly surprised by the shirt because\nthey've never seen anything like it before. Yet it speaks so strongly to them, because the time that\nthese fathers and daughters spend together is some of\ntheir happiest memories. At the time that this T-shirt launched, very few T-shirts out there existed that targeted this very large,\npassionate group of people. Targeting an underserved niche of people is one of the secrets\nof creating successful print-on-demand products. It's why that this T-shirt,\ndespite statistically being more relevant to a bigger audience, did not sell quite as\nwell as this T-shirt here because the previous\nT-shirt targeted a group of people that already\nhad products for it. By focusing on daughters that go hunting with their dads, despite it\nbeing a smaller group of people, it did well because\nproducts in this sub-niche did not previously exist. Although, yes this T-shirt\ndefinitely sold well too, even if it wasn't quite\nas big of a winner. But this fan page is also\nnoteworthy for something else. It's noteworthy for the\nway in which they rapidly grew their fan page and\nthe way that they rapidly grew their sales. What they did, was they\ncreated this amazing design to kick-start it that\nresonated with people and then advertised it\nwith low-cost Facebook ads. Because people really liked\nthe design and shared it with their friends, not only\ndid people go and buy it, but the page got thousands of likes too. They got paid while growing their Facebook Fan Page with ads. The fan page that they then\nused to launch new designs for the future. Pretty cool, right? There's another bonus feature\nto this T-shirt though, that helped them sell a lot of shirts and it's because when\nmost people buy this, they don't just buy one, they buy two. One T-shirt for the dad and one T-shirt for the daughter. Being creative and creating\nproducts that are designed to have somebody buy not\njust one, but multiples of it is one of the easiest ways\nto drastically increase the profits you make when selling online, which is why I teach you how to implement this tactic effectively inside my premium print-on-demand video training\ncourse, The ECOMM Clubhouse. If you're interested in\nsigning up, you'll find a link to it in the\nvideo description below. And you know what, there's\nactually something else that eagle eye subscribers\nwho were watching closely earlier might have noticed. These two successful\nT-shirts, they're essentially just the same design. Once this one design was\nmade, all the creator had to do was swap out\nthe word daughter for son. It's two winning designs\nfor the price of one. So, did you get it right? If so, congratulations. If you didn't though, that's\nokay because we've got another chance for you to win. Here is mystery T-shirt number four. How much money do you\nthink that this made? You have five seconds to guess, go! (cowbell timer tings) (high-pitched bell dings) All right, time's up! Drum roll please!\n(drum roll drumbeat) This T-shirt made over $300,000. Yep, over $300,000. Isn't that crazy? Well, it's not actually that crazy at all. Because believe it or not,\nthis whole little niche of making T-shirts designed\naround people's ages, is actually extremely popular\nand very high in demand. This Teespring store, it\nhasn't just made $300,000 from this T-shirt, nope! It's made over $150,000 with this design and over $40,000 with this design and over $35,000 from this design. If you haven't guessed\nalready why these T-shirts sold so well, a really big part of it is that they kinda fall\nunder the birthday niche. I.e. someone might buy\nthis T-shirt for a friend who is turning 50 or some\npeople might just buy it for themselves as a\nfunny surprise for their friends and family on their birthday. Now, this isn't the\nonly reason why somebody would buy an age-based T-shirt, but it is a really big reason. And actually, while this\nvideo is about Teespring, it is worth deviating for a moment to talk about another website\nwhere this niche dominates and that is Merch by Amazon. This is Amazon's free\nprint-on-demand service. For those of you that\ndon't know, Merch by Amazon works incredibly similar to\nthe way that Teespring does. Once registered, you can\ncreate your own custom products like T-shirts. All you need to do is\nupload the artwork or design you want onto it. You can then go in and select which colors you want your T-shirt to be\nand create a custom product page for it. Your T-shirt product page\nlisting will then go live and people can buy it and find\nit directly on Amazon.com, Amazon UK, and Amazon Germany. Just like this T-shirt here, which is also in the birthday niche. In the last month, it made\nit's creator over $3,000. It's a nice source of side\nincome for it's creator. Just like Teespring, Amazon\nwill collect the money that the customer paid, take\nout the cost of production and then pay out the rest to you as profit in the form of a commission. However, unlike with\nTeespring, where almost anyone can sign up for an account,\nwith Merch by Amazon, you do need to submit an application. So I highly recommend\nthat you go and you Google for advice on how to successfully submit an application letter so that you can get accepted first go like several\nof our subscribers were when they applied after\nwatching my last video. But yes, Amazon is actually\na really common place for people to come and search for T-shirts to buy for birthdays,\nespecially milestone birthdays. Such as this simple text-based\nT-shirt design here, which made over $1,400\npassively last month. And this T-shirt here,\nwhich made almost $5,000 last month passively from free internal search traffic. And another way to\nsuccessfully twist this idea of making a T-shirt about birthdays is to instead of focusing on the\nage, focus on the birth year. Such as this shirt here. While it's aimed at 50 year olds, it focuses on the birthday\nyear, rather than the age. In the last month, this\nhas made over $3,000 and has consistently\nbeen making it's creator thousands of dollars each and every month from free internal search traffic. Did you get it right? If so congratulations. If you didn't, that's all\ngood because you've got another chance to win. It's on to mystery T-shirt number five. Here it is! How much money do you think\nthat this made on Teespring? You have five seconds to guess, go! (cowbell timer tings) (high-pitched bell dings) All right, time's up! Drum roll please!\n(drum roll drumbeat) The answer is that this\nT-shirt made over $100,000. Pretty insane, right? Just the word pretentious\ninside of a red rectangle. And creating this on image editing app would be super simple! Making money online is so easy! I'm gonna go ahead and do this right now. But no, sorry son. It's not quite that simple. The reason why this\ndesign sold over $100,000 is because it was sold by none other than Philip DeFranco, who if\nyou've never heard of him before, runs a news and\ncommentary YouTube channel with over six million subscribers. So, remember, if you are\nusing a product research tool like this to look at\npreviously successful products in places like Teespring\nor AliExpress, be careful. Just because you see a product sold well, doesn't mean that it's\ngood for you to sell because the context of\nwhy a product or a design sold well is extremely important too. So yes, product research apps can be great for print-on-demand stores\nand drop-shipping stores, but don't rely on them. Thanks for watching this video. How many T-shirts did you guess right?

woman's wardrobe and I've bought five t-shirts from brands that either I've had very positive experiences with or that I've heard very good things of I've watched all the t-shirts and I've kind of talked about how they came out the water what the quality is like the fit is like and I can tell you now I've made very good choices and I've got one personal favorite which are reveal at the end of the video so stay tuned don't forget to subscribe to my channel if you love fashion I upload fashion videos every Friday if the little bell then you know when they drop I've also got a German channel so if you understand the language you might want to check it out I'll put the link up here I've got many more fashion videos there and all the pieces that I'm showing in the video today I'll be linking below in the description box as I always do all of the t-shirts are Bordeaux made of cotton Sonam made of linen the scores are the lives they've all got a classic scoop neck except for one with a v-neck where the retailer sent me the wrong t-shirt they haven't got any pockets embroidery and locals or anything because the perfect white tee is just a very clean basic without any fancy stuff and none of them cost under 10 euros because I believe it for under a tener you can't really expect good qualities so that's where I drew the line the designers love a basic white t-shirt Giorgio Armani once said that it transmits a sense of cleaners and at the same time has an unabashed sex appeal about it and it's a man anti status symbol that puts the rich and the poor on the same level in a sheath of cotton and it's just such a versatile timeless piece and then you can wear that any age I just love it it's just a staple and every woman's written man's wardrobe my first impression when I looked at these t-shirts was that the workmanship the stitching is really good on all of them when you look that looks very clean so you can't really see a difference in price there we do see a difference is when you look at the closer at the material I'll get into that in a minute the good thing is none of them are see-through which is obviously important when you boil a t-shirt but still I would wear a very plain you bra underneath black lace will always show through my material and they all washed well but most of them did shrink a little or widened and also get into that a minute the first t-shirt is by Vera Moda a Danish brand this is the cheapest t-shirt in the test it's got the classic straight cut it's a bit wide on me so I would wear it tucked into a miniskirt or just tucked into my jeans like here on me the sleeve length is okay as a rule of thumb you can say the sleeves should end on the middle of your biceps then it usually looks quite flattering this t-shirt is made of 100% cotton it creases quite easily which is normal this cotton there are some obvious that contain Ella stain and they don't crease as easily you could say you're getting good value for money with this t-shirt you're not getting any crap for $12.99 this t-shirt runs true to size a botanist liked all the t-shirts I bought and I'll tell you if they don't run true to size it did drink a little of like they ordered by 2 centimeters and so it's 2 centimeters shorter now and a bit wider one centimeter wider the second t-shirt is by selected firm that is a rasoi Scandinavian brand it belongs to the best seller group at a very low dose belongs to this is 1990 it's also made of 100% cotton the material is a bit better the word sits looks a bit more expensive it doesn't crease as easily as the first one and this is a bit longer than the first one which I don't worry too much about it give me white t-shirt fits perfectly otherwise on the shoulders the sleeves here on the torso then you can always have it taken up and for your orientation I am my head is 1.72 so you can see how this t-shirt is a bit wide on the shoulders for me so if you've got broad shoulders it might be the right one for you plus the sleeves are a bit long what I'd like to do is I'd like to turn knock twice though always looks quite neat many thing is that the sleeps don't stick out too much because that can look very bulky I like how loose this t-shirt is a classic t-shirt supposed to be loose but obviously not to use otherwise the bulky again this d'etre as well it's now one centimetre shorter and one centimeter wider than it was before worship the nest he showed us by Esprit it is a bit of a different cut it's more of a figure hugging cut it's made of 94 percent cotton six percent and it stains or quite stretchy it's got in lower neckline than the other t-shirt that's good if you've got a double chin for instance or a short neck it's always a bit more flattering than these very tight scoop necks the sleeves are pretty short and I will say I like the cut although it's not exactly what I was looking for I like this kind of cut for when I'm wearing baggy trousers or skirts like these paper bag shorts for instance or flowy skirt then just looks a bit better if you've got something figure hugging on the top like nearly all the t-shirts it's now one centimetre shorter than before washing and one centimetre wider and I must say it's really good value for money it cost 16 euros and the quality is really good the next station is the most expensive at 45 euros it's but dry corn that's a German brand and the online retailers sent me a totally different t-shirt than I had ordered I'd ordered a loose fit scoop neck and I got a tight fit and a deep v-neck but I'm not that unhappy about the mistake because it's a really big teacher actually the deep v-neck is great for women who have brought us or a bigger bus because it makes the upper part of your body seems slimmer because it's separated and it also suits me quite well because I've got a bit of a rounder face so it definitely suits round-faced people well please excuse my English I'm a bit out of practice so bear with me this teacher has a great luxurious feel to it it's made of 92% cotton and 8% Ella stain so it is very stretchy which is good but it has its disadvantages because it's not really very forgiving when you sit down you can really see every little bulge the higher the percentage of Ella stain the less forgiving it normally is this went wider after washing by the way which you don't really notice I think you could go up one size with this t-shirt I've got us in s and I think an M would actually be perfect the next tee shirt is by Trajan MA that's a traditional German brim I should probably say Fatima that's how you pronounce it here in Germany this has a bit order in English they produce their stuff only in Germany and I bought this because I've had some great kids t-shirts by Ricky mob this one I've had for about three years longs to my son and I've washed it about 80 times colour hasn't faded at all the red is still very vibrant and the Princeton looks pretty good after three years my person has had to wear this so often he hates it he already hated it when he was five he's now seven years old and he doesn't seem to grow out of it what can you do this one is the thickest one amongst them all by the way the materials lovely soft so cosy and it's got five percent under stain in it so it is a bit stretchy but not a stretch is this one and the good thing is because it's not this stretchy or because it has less elastic and also because it's a bit thicker it doesn't emphasize the bulges as much as this one does my conclusion if you're looking the classic white teen a loose fit with a scoop neck then you get the best value for money with the one who by the paramotor the one who from selected fam is also very good it looks a tad more expensive if you prefer a tight fit and stretchy materials then you'll get great value for money with this Esprit t-shirt 16 euros the luxury version of this t-shirt is the one from dry corn and my overall

that's gonna allow you to print on your sublimation printer with those sublimation inks that is gonna still maintain that bright and colourful finish but you can apply a light or dark garments 100% cotton and you're applying at a very low heat application craziness I know right but I'm talking about a game-changer HDV by Caesar North America out now called easy sub Lea hey everyone I'm Joey Cesar North America welcome to another episode of the decoration zone in this episode I'm gonna show you the entire application process for easy sub ly HDV hangout [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so we have all of our transfers of easy sub we printed out cut now we have to weed away our access material so we're gonna use our Caesar wieder wieder and Pierce away the excess or the cavities within the design now we have everything we did and ready to go the next step is to mask your design if your logo is multiple pieces for example my easy sub Lea transfer here is multiple pieces for one transfer so to get this off of its carrier or its backing I need this caesar ez sub Lea mask to transfer it from here to my garment now you have the option if you had one solid design like this cut out of easy sub Lea you can simply peel it off of its backing and lay it onto the garment so for this we're gonna grab our ez sub Lea mask we're gonna peel the backing off and save this for later now you're gonna lay this on a flat hard surface with the adhesive side facing up you'll take your ez sub Lea transfer and roll it across your ez sub Lea mask make sure you have a squeegee ready to go apply a little pressure and create the bond now you're gonna peel this backing off now this is garbage and if you didn't want to apply this right away you save your backing and lay it back down now we can save this for later if we wanted to and I'm gonna be pressing all my easy sub lis transfers onto various types of garments that we got from our friends at San Mart so I'm working with a hundred percent cotton 50/50 blends 100% polyester and fleece so let's get started first thing we're gonna do is press on our fleece hat so what I'm going to do is set this up since it is a thicker material I'm gonna set this up and make sure my pressure is good first so with the garment on the press I feel like I'm at a lighter pressure so I think we're good to go so first design seal off the backing and press for 15 seconds warm peel [Music] [Music] that was a great first example right I'm just telling you right now the easy sub Li mask is a little bit aggressive so on a fleece substrate like this you did see it was a little bit aggressive on that but that is only because we need that tack to lift the easy sub lis transfer up so now moving on we're gonna be working with a hundred percent cotton a hundred percent polyester and some blends let's keep cruising let's keep doing over here doing so next we have a 50/50 blend tank top right now so I have my heat transfer pillow since right now I'm working with a tank top that has these seams in the way so these right here I want to be careful that I'm getting the proper pressure so with my heat transfer filler I'm gonna slip it inside the garment in the area I'm going to be applying on this is also going to influence the pressure on my press so the first thing I want to do is test the pressure a little too high now we're at a medium pressure just preheated it there the next transfer we're gonna do I did not mask the easy sub lis so I'm actually just gonna peel it off as one piece this is an option if you want and lay it directly onto the garment now you want to make sure you use a cover sheet and as you can tell this is a perfect example the colors do look dull in the initial print but check this out cover sheet press this 15 seconds and look at that right on all right let's keep cruising next up we're gonna do a left chest and this is a poly-cotton blend I'm gonna do a left chest so I want to use another heat transfer pillow since I have my pressure already set up lay this onto the garment and this is a black again with sublimation you would never be able to achieve this now with easy sub ly check this up preheat [Music] leave my cover sheet down and press for 15 seconds again you can peel warm there you go again look at that still smoking so the first one I'm going to apply an upper portion of the pants so I'm gonna set this up on my heat press to get the strings of the sweat pants off the press make sure I have flat space to press on if you want to again use a pillow I'm going to press this right into the pocket my pressure is set I have another transfer that I did not mask so I'm gonna peel it off of its back end [Music] coversheet see the colors check this out look at that all right we're not done with these sweatpants so next I'm gonna do a design down the leg of these sweatpants and use another pillow thread it inside the inside the leg of the pants [Music] pre-heat it [Music] [Music] fifteen seconds get those colors warm peel awesome and one last project we're gonna decorate an apron now again I'm gonna get this buckle this plastic buckle off now this is where he press pillows are extremely important I'm gonna press this design right at the front so I want to watch these pockets I want to watch these seams the buckles everything so preheat first again see the color there watch this and turn this to the camera and check this out look at that [Music] look at all those colors and it's not glittery what that's right we now have the white flat soft HDV that you can sublimate on that heat transfer vinyl that everyone's been asking since we showed you to sublimate on Caesar white glitter HDV we've come a long way and it's here now with easy sub ly HDV now if you do print your transfers on your sublimation printer first and you want to apply this on your ez sub ly later you can do that as a two-step process like I show in the sublimation on glitter HDV videos since we did launch ez subway HDV we did start working with Sawgrass printers specifically the SG 400 and the SG 800 printers also Caeser easy sub links by Sawgrass that's exactly what we've used here on all these transfers that press today I know there are a lot of sublimation users watching this video and it probably like well what about the one I have we don't know quite yet the full capacity of ez stubbly but we do want to hear back from you so please if you have any input about your sublimation printer and what you can do with the EZ subway

you guys! welcome back to my\nchannel if you're new here it's so nice to meet you my name is Liz for today's\nvideo I'll be showing you ten different ways to tie a t-shirt I live in jeans a\nt-shirt or in the summertime more of like a t-shirt and some cut-off denim\nI'm just obsessed with tees I feel most confident and most comfortable it's my\ngo-to top I have a good amount of tees and I'm constantly circling through but\nsomething that I've always wanted to know different ways that I can tie them\nand tuck them so that way it doesn't look like I'm in the same outfit 24/7 so\nI'll be showing you ten ways today I hope you guys enjoyed this video as much\nas I enjoyed filming it and learning new different ways and different techniques\nso yes I love you guys so much and let's get into the video hello you guys\nwelcome to these styles I want to first apologize for my stuffy nose all right I\njust am wearing this simple basic white tee from H&M I have this bra underneath\nI wanted to show you guys just so you know what I'm working with here so for\nthis first look this is super easy I've been doing this one my whole life I\nthink we all kind of have I just tucked it right in the front you could tuck\nthis off to the side if you wanted you could tuck it in all the way around as\nwell oh my gosh just give you two extra styles hey this next one is the one that\nthis is the one that I do probably 24/7 this is the one that I do the most I\njust twist this and then I pull the end through and then you just have this knot\nright here I will say you can leave it with the little thing out but I just\nlike to take it and wrap it around so it kind of creates this little ball I call\nit like my Rose knot I don't know why I just reminds me of like a little rosebud\nso I love this one I wear this one all the time alright you guys for this next\none this one's super super easy it's just as cute it's just a little shorter\nthis is why I wanted to wear a bralette for this one because I feel like this\nwould be fun depending on the different colors you're wearing the type of top\nyou're wearing you just do the same thing but you do it higher and then you\nkind of tuck the knot underneath and then you can let your bra let show I\nthink it's super cute if you do this with like all black I've done that\nbefore it looks just sayin alright alright you guys this\nnext one is so freakin funny oh my gosh I'm like low-key embarrassed um but I'm\nleaving it in because this is the truth you know what I saw this photo on\nPinterest a few weeks ago of this girl's t-shirt where she crossed it and tucked\nit in at the bottom so kind of like a corset but the way she had done it it\nlooked perfect and so cute so I was like oh I'll try\nthat what is that girl you don't even want to know I I've tried this one so\nmany times you guys you know it just Oh Ellie\nhold on I'm recording um I'm gonna leave that in as well this is real life baby\nso if you know how to do this tell me because I honestly was struggling with\nthis I mean what is that look at it and now is where you can find my defeat and\nconfusion and I'm going to sit here and literally try to figure out how the hell\nthat girl did this because it makes no sense to me now this next one is super\neasy I've done this before you just kind of tuck in the sleeves oh my gosh now\nyou have like a tank top aren't these tank tops called something a man tank\ntop who cares I love it and then you just tuck it in\nthe side put on a cute belt with some cut-offs\noh my gosh hello summer do a low messy ponytail this is called he can't stop me\nnow heat not he I think I can't fully pronunciate pronunciate enunciate\nwhatever you got it anyways this next one I love this it's called do you have\nback sweat perfect do this tuck your shirt up into the back of your bra I\nalso saw a picture of this one Pinterest nose like this is freaking cute this is\nso easy so you just want to tuck in back your bra again I have a bra let on so I\nfelt like I was you know it looks kind of funny so you really take the time to\nmake it go across the back and kind of tuck so it looks more like a you in the\nback like upside down you tuck it around the front and then put a cute belt on\nwith this a girl you can really make this adorable\nare you kidding oh my gosh my butt looks good in this shot hello good American\njeans thank you this next one is so easy you guys I've done this before\nespecially if I have been like at the pool and then it gets too hot or\nsomething and I'm just like chilling in my clothes and you just take the sides\nyou twist them you tuck them underneath I'm trying\nmake sure that my bralette doesn't pick up the front cuz that's not what this\nvibe is for I will say you want to be careful at the back this happens to me\nalmost every time where the back is kind of down so you want to tuck that\nunderneath your bra as well so when you fully have this little crop it's so cute\nare you kidding look at me hi ABS hi jeans like hello everyone\nthis is who I am I love this one it's so pretty good for this next one you're\njust gonna take it and you're gonna make some little twisties I call these like\nmy little rose but like I said and I thought it was so cute to do the double\nyou can really take the time to manipulate the shirt and tie them closer\ntogether and you can do like to by each other in the front I always have a\ndifficulty with that if I'm honest but the ones on the side a thinker so cute I\nwill say if you want to use like a hair tie like a clear little rubber band one\nI would use that to kind of wrap around the I almost called them little buns but\naround the little knots because when I was tying this one under this boob I\nnoticed the other one undoes itself you will see that I'm keeping it real here\nyou guys and then I had to fix that one so just a little pro tip little leg pack\ngo ahead and I would just put a little rubber band on those so they say anyways\nisn't this so cute I love especially with the little bra lap you got this\nwould be extra cute if the shirt was bigger I feel like I should have done\nthese looks with a larger t-shirt but you know this is what I was working with\ntoday so we're just gonna work with it oh my gosh this one I saw this girl do a\nvideo where she tied her shirt around her belt loop in charity cute little\nbelt on and her whole outfit was cute look at me struggling I literally I'm\nleaving this in this is really I tried to do good I tried so many times I was\nlike who first of all why would I ever tie my shirt to my belt loop and second\nof all how but you know what the best part about this is and something you\nshould know about me you guys is I always persevere I always push through\nlook I made it I didn't y'all I made it happen and that's all that matters baby\nlook at oh my gosh there's nothing I can't do you know oh yes pose alright\nfor the final one today we're gonna take these sides and we're going to cross\nthem and you're going to kind of wrap like a pretzel just like tie them\nthrough like this perfectly and then you're just gonna tuck the ends in you\ntuck them in it looks so cute I love this little doo-dah I think it's\nadorable I think it's precious and I can't wait\nto do this two new shirts I just recently got a pink tea that I really\nwant to do this too cuz I think that'd be so cute with some gold jewelry are\nyou kidding oh my gosh dude this is so cute look at me you work in it hey I'm\nhopping and really quick

Cricut blank t-shirt t-shirt that has 50% polyester a 50% cotton and a teacher that has 100% content so we are going to do in fusible ink on each one of these t-shirts and see the difference that it makes please like this video and follow my page for everything sewing and Cricut let's get started I am already wearing a t-shirt that I made with infeasible ink you can find the video where I tell the difference between iron on vinyl and infusible ink this t-shirt has been awesome I've loved wearing it this quote says I can show you the world and it's kind of a spin-off of a quote from Aladdin and the quote we're doing today is so this is love this is a quote from Cinderella and it the word is just so soo instead of spw so I'm not gonna go into a lot of detail about infusible ink since I've already done a video about it but essentially it's not something that sits on the fabric it actually goes in infuses and stains the fabric I already cut the quote from the infusible ink transfer sheet I've already weeded it I cut the exact same for each t-shirt as you can see and we are going to start with the Cricut blank so you need a mat you need an easy press too you also need this little Rolly just so you can get any lint off of your t-shirt so let's warm up the shirt for a little bit get it nice and warm ironed really flat so you put this in the middle so that the ink doesn't go through to the back let's see if that's the right size then you put your transfer sheet okay I've transferred this and then you need to put a piece of parchment paper on top the way now I'm going to put it on and you can't move it around you can't bump it and you want to sit and it's at 400 degrees for 40 seconds and you carefully place it down and then you carefully lift it up now I lift this lift my paper [Music] and you just peel it off and you have a really great shirt so I can see that the ink didn't fully transfer and some of the spots I don't know if that was the heat but I think it still came out and it looks really good so let's try it on a different t-shirt this is the this is the t-shirt that's 5050 to clean it off I'm going to place this in between the two layers of butcher paper and for 15 seconds this place this on I put my butcher paper back on and carefully lift it lift your put your paper and you can do a warm peel lift this so as you can see part of my thread piece right here can you see that it's like right here part of it didn't transfer right there because it got ripped and moved to the other side but do you see how this is not nearly as dark as this this is very dark even the spots where the ink didn't fully transfer this one is much much darker than this one so let's try the last one I wonder if the ink will transfer at all I guess the in fusible ink really is supposed to work with polyester so I wanted to compare what it looks like when you don't use a cricket blink warm up the t-shirt for 15 seconds it's up now I'm going to clean this off carefully I'm going to place my transfer sheet put my paper back on and let's heat this one I wonder it's the ink even Sandford let's see you can do a warm peel and it did transfer but there's still a lot of ink left on this instead of being transferred to that oh how interesting the ink even went through on that last one the ink went through the fabric into the folder that's why you always need something in between the protective layers but it didn't transfer on any of my other shirts just the cotton one that's very interesting so I will say I was watching the easy press - while I was heating this and I had it set at 400 and when I started it was at 400 but I saw it fluctuate in that 40 seconds I stopped fluctuate between 380 385 three ninety four hundred I saw it going you know up and down I could see it struggling to keep the heat up at four hundred and so I think that when it was going down to 380 that's why the ink didn't fully transfer right here at the top when I did this one the ink transferred perfectly and there was no ink left on the transfer sheet this one definitely looks the best that black is black and dark and the lines are very clean and crisp it looks very good this one interestingly enough is I think this one still has clean and crisp lines probably because there was polyester in the shirt but it's very faded it looks like as if it had been through the wash 50 times so you probably wouldn't want to wear this or give this to someone because it doesn't look that professional while this one looks like you bought it this door looks very good and this one I would say the color is better this is darker than this middle one but the lines are very fuzzy and almost like green on the edges it looks really it just doesn't look really great if you see that I don't know if you can see so can you see those green edges and this one is very faded and this one looks the best this tells me that you need to use a hundred percent polyester fabric to make infusible ink work if you are really nervous just buy a cricket in fusible ink blink which will be perfect and look the best it will always work even if you follow the instruction correctly and have the heat at the right temperature instead of using these other shirts that really don't look as good or work as well as the cricket blink if you like this quote I can show you the world or so this is love they're both Disney sewing inspired quotes you can buy the cut file on my page or in Etsy I will link to them into the description I can't wait to see what you make within fusible ink please share it with me on social media thanks for watching this video you", "fgQTUZc9JD4": "[Music] target eat dim black black let's see what I have in black [Music] oh I have only one day shot in black let's try this out so this t-shirt looks cool but the print on it [Music] so as you can see the print already shot has faded and also the ages are washed out so I decided to remove the whole print and that is what the video is all about now without wasting more time let's start the video to remove the paint from the t-shirt first you will need a wet cloth and a dry cloth Here I am using a small hand towel for this now what I will do is I will place this flag lot inside the t-shirt under the print [Music] [Music] make sure that you place it properly under the printer now place the red cloth on the print which you have two rings [Music] plug in the iron and don't forget to turn it into high cotton sateen then iron the vet load to melt and who's in the plain below it continue this for at least three to four minutes until the print becomes loose [Music] now take a knife or spoon am using a spoon here and is rubbing it on the printer this will lose the print more if you fail at the print is still not melted then iron it again for mode one minute [Music] if you feel that the print has now become news then start peeling it off trust me guys this progress will not rain or damage our t-shirt at home only please be careful when using the iron so what happened was when I was filling the print off I felt that the print is not still coming out properly and then I realized the wet hand towel which I was using was thick and because of it the print was not maintained properly so I decided to use a thin hand kerchief for it and guys I'll suggest you to use the same but make sure that you use the old handkerchief because there is a possibility that the print might stick to it or transfer the color to it [Music] as you can see a lot of great has been removed and the color of the print has completely transferred to the handkerchief so make sure that he used old handkerchief and also now the print as you can see is coming out more easily [Music] [Music] [Music] Capri has almost been removed and yes I can bear it now [Music] if you guys like this video or found it useful then don't forget to like and share the video and also subscribe to my channel and click on the bell button so

to make one on your own if you have an extra t-shirt and scissors you have everything you need to make your own DIY face mask at home lay out your materials on a flat surface cut around the bottom of the t-shirt make sure the cut is tall enough to cover the distance from the bottom of your chin to the bridge of your nose about 7 to 8 inches take this loop of material and cut out a 6-inch square from one side cut the top and bottom strips in half so you have ties for the top and bottom of the mask try on and cut any excess material to help it fit your face it's important to have a good snug fit on any protective mask as an extra layer of protection consider adding a copy filter to the inside of your mask it's best to stay home but if you do have to go out wear a mask anytime you're in

uh-huh boyfriend but so I did alright so number one is soft feels great for my skin it has an okay caller the stretch is pretty decent now yeah it's definitely fitted it's soft it it definitely is a soft shirt overall good white shirt nothing nothing too crazy about it the stretch ability I would give it a 4 out of 5 shirt I would give it a 4 off or I think I'd give it like like a for softness I think I'd give it a 4 out of 5 shirts as well I mean that it's a cotton shirt so it has the cotton feel it's not like a really soft poly or anything I'd give it a 3/5 shirt four out of five shirts [Music] so to is a looser fit definitely the number one longer sleeves why the body sauce it's a bit stretch here not as stretchy actually as a pretty thick collar kind of reminds me of like a work shirt you see mrs. heavy um its sheer so it's a bit more trendy you know such ability on this one I would give it a five out of five shirts five out of five shirts for this one I would give it a two so this one will be a for assault softness four out of five for some kind of reason this feels softer but I guess is the same I'd give this this one I gave a three right I'd give this a three twenty two and a half a three out of five shirt softness I would actually give it a five out of five all right the shirt number three drumroll please yeah this one's really big it's a bit rough it looks very like you'll drown in the shirt even if it would fit you type of shirt stretchy will give it that ya know that's something my ex-boyfriend would wear I don't like it I guess it depends on what your style is this is more of a you know heavier cotton shirt so it probably goes goes better together with wider looser fit jeans you know that kind of a style what number one is definitely like a look at like a skinny guy shirt stretchability on this shirt um here we go out of five shirts at three out of five t-shirts so for those I gave a 4 this would be more like it 201 I would not say this is stretchy at all it's a offer heavier material sell that I get three for those two and this one is closer to not soft one out of five my gosh I'd say it would have to be a negative one out of five t-shirts I would give it a three out of five t-shirts number four again is the material is closer to what number one and number two was definitely a going-out shirt it's still pretty sick but very stretchy and still sheer enough to you know help out with now that summers coming here in California it's longer than the rest which is nice and really tall it feels stretchy it's pretty comfortable I kind of just want to wear it okay see stretchability definitely a five five out of five shirts stretchability I'd give it a five out of five t-shirts I'd still give it a four softness I would give it a five out of five softness five out of five shirts to really solve the other is three and a half softness it would have to be a fire [Music] out of all four t-shirts here I would definitely pick number four number four the winning t-shirts is shirt number four this one's the winner my future husband will be wearing this shirt the day we meet what Bella yeah I guess it's the sleeve the sleeve is the sleeve is shorter again it is more like a unisex feel on it", "1iiHuN60BtI": "hello everyone welcome back to the YouTube channel its Rachel here from echoes gonna learn your ultimate dark hiding community I want to start off by saying if you have a die cutting machine that works with SVG or PNG cut files you will absolutely love makers gonna learn we have over a thousand digital cut files over 200 fonts of Members Only Facebook group free online trainings a free commercial license it's so so much more goodness so if you are interested in just browsing around and seeing what we have to offer click the very first link in the description below but guys today I have another super fun video all about Cricut infusible Inc it's taking the crafting world by storm it's taking the da cutting world by storm so we're here to talk about it ok we're here to talk about materials you didn't know you could use with Cricut and feasible ink now I'm talking about this because once you bought Cricut infeasible ink you know you are recommended to go on Cricut calm and look at the Cricut blank so they have to offer and there's not many now that's not saying that Cricut might not come out with some more in the future I'm sure they're working on some but as of right now there are just not very many blanks and you seem a little limited you know you got some coasters and you got some cloth things like t-shirts and tote bags you know but you don't have a lot of variety in really cool things so I've done my research I've really tried to find some really fun things for you guys and we have got several different types of infusible ink we've tested this on several different products we didn't we're not showing you guys the ones that we've tested on we're just showing you guys the products today just so you guys know that you are able to use Cricut infeasible ink on all of these really really cool things so don't feel like you're limited to only crickets very short list of products and blanks that you can use with infusible ink so today we're here to talk about a lot that you can use and I have a piece of paper over here that shows me I've written down all the prices because I don't know about you guys I'm all about process I want to know how much something costs I want to know if it come if it can come in a multi pack I want to know if it's worth it I want to know every things so we're gonna I'm gonna take you through the products today one by one and then I'm gonna show you guys how you can use infeasible ink on it and how it would be successful and then I'll show you guys the process I will let you guys know how much each of these work and a lot of these did come in packs so I've done all the math for you guys and I'm showing you how much it costs for one of these atoms and before you say anything I do realize that we have white walls a white table and all of these blanks are also white so if you have trouble seeing them I'm sorry I didn't even think about it I should have covered the table in a really pretty color paper or something like that just so you could see these better but bear with me guys but first we're going to talk about I'll start on one side and kind of work my way where we're going to talk about the Hat so these hats these are sublimation blank hats and again I mentioned at another video before I get backlash or comments coming I'm gonna go ahead and say I know that cricket infusible ink is not the same as sublimation even though it pretty much is but I'm not gonna say curricular fusible link is sublimation I'm saying that the same products that you use for sublimation are usually high polyester content things things that are coated that also can work with create infuse blanks so you're gonna hear me say sublimation a lot in this video that doesn't mean that that's what Kirk is doing I'm not saying it is or it isn't I know it's a lot like sublimation but finding the blank is compatible with this product is definitely the route that you want to go as far as looking for things that say sublimation so that's all I'm saying a little disclaimer but this is a sublimation hat it came in a pack of four it's just a black hat it says OTT oh one size fits most it's what it says for us here and it's got like a little plastic e thing here in the top I guess just like a little protective layer we got there but I can remove that and this came in a pack of four it's a really good sturdy hat it was made really really well and before you guys asked I found all this stuff on Amazon I will do my best to link it in the description I'll try catch these videos when they go out and put all this in the description below so you guys just bear with me though another price for this hat it was it came in a 4-pack like I mentioned but the price for one hat is just $2.99 so that is not a bad price this is a really nice hat and you all know that for infeasible Inc they just do not recommend dark fabrics although you know me guys you know I love me a good comparison video so I will for sure be testing Cricut and fuse blink on lock wash arts of gray shirts and black shirts comparing them all seeing how they do seeing how they don't do and letting you know because that's just who I am I love to compare things so that's it for the hat 399 we're gonna move on to this you guys are gonna be like what this is those ever-popular sequin mermaid pillowcases that are like two-sided you can see here that's really pretty but you can see these are these other ones that are like two-sided but if you all did not know you can sublimate on this and you can use cricket and fusible ink on this too this came in a pack of two it's really really cute now you will want to use the in fusible ink on the white side I know that was probably clear but just you know PSA you do want to use that on the white side because these are so fun I could play with those all day but those are super cool really trending right now you could put like a secret message or a big you know a big quote or anything right there if you're a member of makers gonna learn you could use one of our thousand cut files or one of our fonts to personalize it for maybe a wedding anniversary or Valentine's Day or Christmas or something like that would be super super cute and festive and again that came in a pack of two and the for one it's 399 so same as the Hat I think same as the Hat ya know this was $2.99 and this is 3 9 on so again guys these are bargains that I'm finding ok these are really good prices and moving on you're pro like us what is this so this guy's is a really cute ceramic you can hear that it's definitely ceramic it is a little Christmas ornament now you could do different things this it could be a necklace if you want it to be a necklace you could do a ton of different things with it but this is you know on Amazon a Christmas ornament and it is for sublimation and you can use these on Cricut and feasible ink and I can just imagine if you guys are makers gonna learn members we have over I think it's close to 300 if not over 300 cut files just for Christmas and I know that we have some really beautiful print and cut files that I cannot wait to use Cricut and feasible ink to put on these ornaments the one that keeps poking popping in my head is the truck that's carrying Christmas trees and that one is gonna be so cute I cannot wait to put it on here we'll definitely make that a live stream for you guys because I know you guys will love that but love love that this they came in a pack of 10 to their small came in a pack of 10 and those are $1 excuse me two dollars and fifty cents each it was a little on the pricier side I think this is the most expensive thing that we definitely have in this video and that's not too expensive now they're not the most expensive as far as one goes but as far as the whole pack goes it definitely was more expensive it was around $23 fourteen of these but again once you add all that up and you do all that math two dollars and 50 cents per one is not that bad at all so a sublimation mugs now know what you guys are thinking there is absolutely no way I can sublimate on mugs or use my Cricut and feasible ink where there's a will there's a way guys and this hack is mostly for people that actually have a heat press the one that we have it's not Cricut it's not an easy press it's not anything like that it's a five and one heat press and it actually has attachable clamp for mugs so if I type my in fusible link design on here and I wrap that heat plate around it then it will work and it will work beautifully so I'm sure we'll be doing a video on that because I really can't wait for you guys to see how well it works but those mugs now these are sublimation mugs okay I told you'd be hearing a lot of that word today um you can't just go out and buy any mug you know it's got a special coating this and that I'm not a scientist but know what I got about so this is a sublimation mug it came in a pack of two and for one of these it's $8.99 Oh which isn't terrible so if we're thinking about the longevity in the laughs that these guys will have I think that's a really good price to pay for a mug that we can use their cricket and fusible ink on and the next product it's probably my favorite just because I'm thinking of all the possibilities that I have with it are these puzzels these are sublimation puzzles and you you can literally take your you know take your pattern take your image take whatever you want to apply it on here heat it and that it's transferred and I can't wait and then it's a puzzle think of all the gifts that you could make with this think of how cute this would turn out think of doing like oh will you go to prom with me a puzzle and then taking it to your little girlfriend or boyfriend and letting them put the pieces together to see it I don't know why that popped in my head I like I know I didn't even ever go to a problem but like still I just I think of little things like that little surprises and people people love puzzles my mother-in-law absolutely loves puzzles she works puzzles all the time but if you guys love puzzles you will love these look how many you get in a pack too so these puzzles came in a pack of 24 and guys these are 50 cents apiece okay 50 cents apiece now I will go ahead and let you know they do not transfer lock flawlessly they are puzzles so you know of course there's a little bit of grooves and dips and things here and there but they do it does transfer it does work does it work 100% the way it should is it does the ink come out as bright as it should no it does not but that is okay if you just want this you know like I said to do a little promposal thing to do a little surprise then that works totally fine with it we love those though there are a great bang for your buck for 50 cents a pop and you know one of those will last you a good long while you could take those to school if you want to give them to your students if you have a children's chart you could make them for children and have them you know make the little puzzles a lot of possibilities with these little sublimation puzzles and I think they're super cute now you guys know that I love me a good koozie and we found some koozies now the same thing you're going to treat this like cloth you know your do all your pre treats on it and you can sublimate on this and then you'll have you a little kuzey I'm thinking this for weddings for parties for things like that amazing ok 4th of July that would be great too and things like this can easily be a good favor a great wedding favor and these guys I think this is a pack of 12 yes there were so as a 12 pack from Amazon and these were only 74 cents apiece so that is a steal in my book paying less than a dollar for anything any kind of craft and blank is what I'm all about so I love that these are just 74 cents a piece came in a pack of 12 like I mentioned and then last but not least I'm not gonna pick it up well I can't pick it up it's not a big deal is I know what you're thinking you're like Rachel that's just paper what in the world so if you know anything about cricket and fusible ink markers then you know that you have to use laser printer paper to transfer that well that's true however if you can't find laser printer paper if your whole town is out of it if all else fails you can use a regular printer paper now it's not gonna transfer as bright and as vibrant as it should but it will transfer so I really don't like it when people say you absolutely cannot use something and you absolutely have to use this one thing when in reality another method would work maybe not the best but it was to work so for those of you who maybe you know can't afford the laser printer paper because it is quite expensive it's about $20 for 300 sheets and then you can use a regular printer paper at your own risk you know it's not gonna it's not going to come out wow vibrant you know but it is gonna transfer it it's gonna work so go ahead and test that if you want to if you want to scribble a little heart you know on some of your regular printer paper and things like that and you guys know I've already got it in the works if it's not already out I'm gonna be doing a comparison video on laser printer paper versus regular printer paper and the Cricut infusible ink markers so just let you know if if that video is already out it will be linked in the description if it's not linked in the description it's not out yet so no worries I don't know order these are going to be in but you can use a regular printer paper if you want to well guys definitely leave us a comment down below and let us know what is your favorite blank that you're going to be using with your Cricut and fusible ink next I love all of these blanks and I don't want you guys to feel like you are limited to the blanks that Cricut has on my website because you're not all of these will be so much fun to create with and to test with and to see if they work and see if they don't in your own home and you know to learn from and things like that and with prices like these you can definitely you know try it out several times like the puzzles how they come in a 24 pack you can test and retest those as many times as you'd like you can do small tessellation you're not wasting a lot of your material I love love videos like this they just kind of teach you guys and show you guys some of what you're missing so that you're not going to

your mouth and you don't put that", "RW06COJKjRg": "there's the two differences between sublimation which is what you see here on the left this is a polyester fabric which has texture of cotton but is still 100% polyester that's how you get the sublimation effect so you cannot tell where there is income when there is not ink also because it's sublimation the colors will never fade and will not bleed into the other areas so this is very very durable very bright top quality where on the other side we have a transfer process and this can only be made once you have a cotton shirt and what you see here is a sort of decal effect sort of a glue that is gonna go on top of the the coffee so once that glue you know breaks or you know the laminates from the fabric that's when you're gonna start losing all the the print that you see here so again that's the flexibility you have with sublimation and transfer transfer again goes into 100% cotton sublimation can go into polyester those are the two differences that you get between these two", "ydLoixuy3SE": "good morning oh it's not morning it's noon my time it's morning for some of you so today we're going to be working with an fusible ink on a black bag let me explain feasible ink doesn't work on black so what we're doing is putting glitter on the bag first white glitter and then unfeasible ink on top of it now somebody has messaged me a picture of the in fusible ink design on a black shirt and I'm like how did you do that and she said she puts it on glitter it works if you iron on glitter and then infused to the glitter I'm like oh and she's like you should do a video doing that I'm like oh I just might do that because the these little shirts they don't fit me so I and I wear a lot of black as you know and I'm like well I want to make sure it's with this awesome designs of infeasible ink I'm starting to horde them now and so I want to do them on a black bag and okay no not less than an hour after I got this message Laurie nunamaker messaged me with a little video where she did a little unicorn and a head glitter in it and she says I'm uploading a video on using them usable inks and glitter so if you don't watch Laurie nunamaker you can go to her Channel and watch how she did that on white glitter on one of the infusible ink shirts she's one of these shirts now in fusible ink is amazing because you can stretch it you can wash it it doesn't fade at all when you're using it on the Cricut blanks and you don't feel it that that was an amazing thing for me that you don't feel this at all it doesn't you don't feel it if you were blind you wouldn't know it was there today what we're doing is not going to be that way it's not gonna do that amazing not feel you won't feel it I'm the glitter but you kind of feel the glitter if that makes sense does that make sense you guys have questions yet we are live on Facebook and YouTube and twitch good morning everyone you guys are so awesome so many green names in the chat today on YouTube that means you are a supporter on my youtube channel and you get to use all the fun emojis and you get all my projects Mary Stevens said she did an infeasible ink and glitter on a purple shirt and it came out awesome it does it comes out awesome so if you want these awesome and fusible ink designs and glitter you can put them on dark thing so we're gonna do that today I haven't done it and I was gonna have my glitter iron at all weeded out and then I'm doing this I'm like this is so incredibly easy to weed I thought when her iron-on was hard to weed and this is so incredibly easy I was actually shocked I wasn't sure what time I was gonna do this video he's like well let me cut this out make sure I can weed it okay and I don't have any problems and I don't have to do it again I'm like wow this is easy and I just ordered more glitter iron-on they have it in bulk at Cricut calm and I have a link in the description below for the bulk of the iron glitter iron on how glitter iron-on is usually more expensive than regular iron on and you can buy it in bulk it's only 27 cents for a 12 by one inch that's how much it comes with in bulk if you don't buy it in park it costs 63 cents in it I just figured that out today I'm like well which one is cheaper and you can use my code and it'll be even cheaper and if you have access it'll be even cheaper then okay let's get to the project you think so okay I'm gonna take it as design space first so this is the project that I'm doing creativity is contagious pass it on creativity this past that I came on a little banner I changed it up I didn't want the banner and I wanted to do something with like the paint like it looks like you're painting it because I'm doing rainbow because that's my favorite and I have five boxes of Vodun fusible rainbow color so I sliced that out of there and sliced a square out of the pass it on and I was gonna do them let me show you what I was gonna do I was gonna do the glitter everything that you see purple was gonna be glitter let's change this up so we can see it better we're gonna change the purple to white okay so I was gonna do it like that so this black will not be black it'll be rainbow color and then the white will just be plain white glitter but then I'm like oh I don't know so what I decided to do is get rid of that and actually this would be a color let's just say it's that and then this would be black and then I decided looking at it in design space I decided it would be prettier with the black it'll show up more at the rainbow color so that's what we're doing today so let's get over here Thank You Barbara on Facebook I do see your facebook notes and yes it is cricket glitter iron-on yeah it's so easy I thought people had trouble reading iron-on so I did on the outside I did this and it's you can see all the cuts really easy sorry this is shadow because of my camera but see all those cuts it's so easy I thought I might need my bright pan for this but it's look it's the easiest stuff so I wanted to show you how easy it is because without seeing it I wouldn't believe it there are some little pieces in here I'm using my little pic from my wieners kit from cricket yeah cricket glitter iron-on is amazing I have a lot of it I haven't used it a lot you guys I when I craft I pretty much show you everything I do so I don't do a lot of iron-on I do some but I'm gonna be doing more because I bought the ball roll I don't have it yet but I did order the bulk roll of glitter iron-on oops missed that Q has the middle section I pulled it all off so we're just gonna set that back down I'm gonna hold down the middle part of the Q and lift everything else off there you go and then I didn't weed the infeasible ink at all because I'm gonna show you how so many people some people are having great results with the weeding it and some are having harder results so I'm just gonna show how I do it and when we do infeasible ink we have to use the I don't see it now I had it somewhere my what's it called lint roller you have to use the Lett roller on this shirt I'm like well that's a great idea to use that even for iron on it would keep thing your iron on from peeling off at times so I lint rolled in my bag and this is not a new bad guys I thought I had some new ones but I don't so let me flip over what's on the other side of this bag the other side of this bag is the first time I ever used my chocolate or inks and I made this on the back and I'm like well I can just do this project and the back of this bag it's just a canvas bag there's links for him I bought him involved from Amazon these are cotton the infusible ink will not work on the bag without the glitter iron on okay and I did Oh oh my gosh it's like it was right there and I looked exactly right there and it wasn't there so Soylent rolled it once and this was almost all black and then this is the second time I cleaned it off and did it again and if all that was on there I don't think it would of ironed very well or it might and not iron night stay when you wash it okay let's okay what am i coming to I I'm gonna do this I'm gonna read this I was trying to figure out if I was gonna go ahead and start putting that on I'm gonna get rid of all of this because I don't want to earn that unto my easy press Matt welcome to Anna okay so we're gonna take this off of Matt to take it off the mat we're flipping the Matt over and pulling this off and we're gonna weed this one we're gonna weed out what we weeded out on that one I'm gonna cut this one I didn't put my box around here that I usually do to save things so my cut around this cuz you never know when I might need this for other projects what these will work right on coasters or put a word across here put it on the shirt okay so now this is different weeding you bend it and crack it hear that crack so I'm gonna just start right there and I'm gonna pull that up it's much easier to bend it and then pull this part up alright have it pulled up so I don't need to do this again but I just wanted to show you instead of trying to go to the corner and pulling that way and I also want to show you some people have we did this in some of this paper you can see it better here see that paper there they're trying to weed that out like they have everything we need but they're left with a little paper it's okay leave the paper there to waste you there's no ink right there so you do not need to weave it don't worry about that I mean here you would but if there's no color on and like part of it came up don't worry about it and like I have a bag I'm saving all my pieces I'm gonna make a mosaic someday with this kit kat says she's an obsessed with the invisible ink I just might be a little obsessed also see now what I just did there I pushed my finger through here and just bent it down and just pushed on my finger from the underneath make sure your hands are extremely clean and dry I keep losing my eye actually I lost it in the glitter the top to the eye so I don't know it just was it here too it's not gonna be in the same spot now wait I can see it we'll see what happens cuz the white one is not there oh there it goes again so what I'm doing on this OH to get the middle I'm rubbing it with my nail underneath see my finger moving underneath I'm rubbing it with my nail underneath and just pops right up oh no but I can see where it's cut out so I can see right where it goes yeah because we're putting this on top that's like glitter we have to have in the right spot so we'll see I don't know if it'll be right it looks like it is okay be careful melody there at that time I held the letter on while I picked up the other one I think it's good and then we're gonna weed out these letters now you can use these letters again let me show you how do you use the letters okay if you want to reuse the letters you just lay them on your project you have to do it backwards they have to be reversed and then you can just iron put butcher paper over it and iron it on so I'm saving all these letters someday I'm gonna write a ransom note I'm just I'm I'm pushing it with my nail like I wasn't even thinking that my fingers were just doing it so I'm going with it maybe that's why it's so easy for me because I never even knew I was doing that my fingers just do it automatically and I did hair people said I have magic fingers because I did a lot of my hair styling with the actual fingers and I could never tell people how I did it it's just my fingers just did things like they had a mind of their own they still have a mind of their own especially when typing I never really learned to type I typed mostly if one hand and sometimes the words like in my head I know exactly how to spell it and my words are spun a totally different way my hands I'm like why did I type that hey I just might be a little crazy I got this I don't like I only have these little pieces here so you just bend it and the pieces just pop right out there we go looking it over okay looks good now we got a where's my bag I got my bag of pieces and letters yeah would that be fun to make like a mic not a real ring I'm not gonna kidnap anyone but even to make it on a kids shirt like kind of like the ransom style or something I don't know I just think it'd be cute I don't know what it would say but I think it would be fun that is correct Glenda if you're not using glitter because the iron on glitter is polyester put you in these bigger pieces in here and my other letters I have over here oh I lost the dot on the explanation point oh I did it's gone now I picked it up hmm you know what I have a die we're gonna test this so this diet is bigger it probably came from this one but we're gonna put it at the bottom of the explanation putting you know on the Glitter one I lost it to you but then I found it I'm going to try to stick this big dot on here and with this we're going to remember to test it and see if we can see any of the ink around where the glitter one is so this is going to be on top of the glitter and there will be black here so we'll see if any of that shows up at all I don't think it will it might a tiny bit but if it did it would wash right out but it's a bag I'm not washing anyway so we have that oh we need to turn on the easy press now the directions for the iron-on is 270 degrees and the directions for then feasibly ink is 285 degrees what Laurie said she did in her video was to follow the directions as she did for the iron-on okay I'm not going anywhere are we oh it's too high I'm gonna go because she did on a polyester shirt and I'm doing it in cotton I'm gonna I'm gonna do 280 mm maybe maybe 275 there and we're not doing for 240 seconds oh my gosh I just turned it off time lower the timing for the iron-on is 30 seconds oh I want to see it right here how did you guys see that there's a little dot there okay we're still not down on tango if you hold it down it goes down in five second increments I'm gonna do 35 seconds and to do how I need butcher paper I forgot to show you this is the one we're doing this is how it looks now it's gonna be much brighter and how many's put your paper oh I'm gonna put card stock underneath my bag for one because of this on the back and for infusible ink you should be putting something inside but because the ink is not going to be on the bag itself the ink is gonna be on the glitter if there is any on the bag and it goes through I personally I'm not worried about it I don't care okay we also want to make sure we're not on any seams but your paper is not the same as parchment paper butcher paper takes out the moisture so I'm going to do a little preheat with the butcher paper first honey our Jennifer says she is scared she bought and feasible Incan is scared to do it go to the how-to links at Cricut and follow those instructions completely follow the they give you you have to pick the directions for if you're using inks or the sheets and what you're putting it on so it gives you exact directions if you're putting it on a coaster a square or round coaster there is a difference there are different timings and different temperatures and you do one upside down and the other you don't so you want to read the exact instructions if you're doing it on a shirt or a tote bag they're different instructions so make sure you read the exact instructions okay now for the glitter iron on this wants to be hot and I'm gonna just press it straight on here because this is cotton and we're not using an fusible ink right on the cotton so this is instructions on the glitter iron on the Cricut glare iron on I went to the Cricut how-to site and typed in glitter iron on to get the exact instructions so what we're going to do is we're going to press this on for 5 to 10 seconds and then we're gonna pull this off and then we're going to put that on Oh Judy she ordered the white glitter iron down with her mystery box awesome that was a smart idea if you guys haven't gotten the mystery box I think they're actually still available and you get out and I'm in that you get a Cricut cuny okay you do not need a teflon sheet when you're using the easi press with iron on things a lot of people say you have to put a teflon sheet the easy press has a ceramic coating I need to see this can pull off I'm gonna do a little longer yes Kara you can use the invisible ink will stick to the cricket glitter iron-on but you will not have that awesome feeling that in fusible ink yet so if you just joined us in fusible ink is amazing because you can't feel it it doesn't wash off now with the boudoir iron-on you do feel it and you can can you hear it I don't know if you guys can hear it like you feel it can you guys hear me rub it you won't be you can't hear me rub this like there's nothing there you can't feel it off so the in fusible ink will last longer on this glitter then the glitter will last on the bag but in fusible ink on the Cricut and a fusible blanks will probably outlast the shirt this will not wash off if you use other sublimation blinks they're not guaranteed and they have tested all different kinds of fabrics and materials and different types of polyesters and different things they found it works best with these you could get results with other ones but just not as bright or as good okay so now we're going to like this this might be the hard part putting this exactly over the glitter Thank You Ronald hey Ronald I'm sending you off something today something special it's more than just that bag oh this is not exactly if I don't give it exactly over it you're gonna see some white so if you see some white that's cuz they didn't do it perfectly so let me just say you just might see some white this is my first time doing this I also thought about and we're going to test this out because this ink is bigger right here on the stock and what the glitter ink is why not just put a whole sheet without cutting this out of infusible ink just put a square over it but I'm worried that you'll see the ink on the black too much like it would probably wash out as soon as I washed it though so that might be an option that might be something for you to test and then that way it would totally be covered all of the white and then when you wash it it would probably be good okay and push in the Sun I think it's pretty good up here I might see a little bit of the glitter I'm not sure but it seems to be covered everywhere else okay you guys ready I'm a little nervous I am going to go ahead and cover this with butcher paper and we are gonna go for it I have my 9 by 9 easy press just as light pressure we do love Ronald he makes these things fun okay we're gonna lift this off are you guys as nervous as I am oh it's not very bright maybe it needs to go on a little longer all right I'm gonna put it right on it just for a few seconds because the infeasible ink really is supposed to be on there longer it's not very bright shade it longer I don't know let's see okay let me take you over here um I did the things for this let's go to infeasible ink sheet the base I don't know what to put for the base I'll put a tote bag but that's for a polyester tote bag oh yeah it's 385 not 285 all right I'm gonna heat it up oh wait a minute maybe no I'm gonna heat it up oh let me bring you over here yeah because that's what the glitter was for 285 we're gonna go up to 385 and we're gonna try it again there's some color there but it's not enough Lori did at the same temperature as the glitter iron-on was supposed to be that's what she said in the video I thought stop touching it I know I shouldn't be touching it okay it's at 3:30 Oh guys in for class on Saturday you guys know I do free design space classes every Saturday morning at 11:00 a.m. I have no idea what we're doing this week in class so if you want to comment if you're watching the replay comment down below the video tell me what you want to learn oh you said lorry use the infusible ink setting okay well here we go oh wait I went up to let's go five more whoops okay we're going to use them feasible in setting I'm gonna put this over it I don't know why really there we go we're gonna do it again for 40 seconds okay mindset for 30 so we'll count to five afterwards you can put vinyl on leather bracelets you can do iron-on on almost anything I've learned on a poster board I've ironed on a card card stock one one thousand two one thousand three one thousand four one thousand yep it was not the correct heating like I said guys I haven't tried this oh it's so pretty I can see it for me to need I'm gonna let it cool a little bit because then fusible ink is a solid and when you heat it up to those high temperatures I was thinking I was not off that much by the infeasible ink that's why you put it up to those high temperatures and it turns into a gas and fuses into whatever you have it on it's so pretty you can see some of the white see and that's I think some of these pieces were because I pressed it so much and then I was lifting it off and didn't get on their good I didn't have an even should we try it again see I think I can try it again even if it's not perfectly even well actually it doesn't have to be in the same spots otherwise it's wrong I don't know it's alright but isn't it pretty if I would have done it correctly the first time oh I'm gonna try this again I'm gonna try to get that ink on here I don't know why papers kind of lumpy am I trying to get and see what happens this is really just a bag that was in my closet they don't even use so let's experiment really only watch and I'm gonna do it and push down over here yeah it still looks cool with that yeah you all earned a little extra lesson when you're using it on top of glitter iron-on use infeasible ink setting like want to push it down in there well it's hot you're not supposed to do this what the reason I'm thinking it's okay is cuz it's on black if it was on white I would not do that oh look it helps more there see it words and that's where I rubbed it to I'm gonna do it again I'm gonna do this so much that glitter is gonna come off the bag cuz I'm ruining it okay now I remind all the seams also I'm just gonna heat it up just a little more and I'm gonna push it down with my coaster but I got a hold it down with the other coaster cuz this is too hot to touch I'm putting don't do this guy's if I did this on white it would be a complete mess oh well it's got some spots but it's so pretty isn't it under how I can if they're still on here you think I can get them on there but oh well it's still pretty and it's glittery see the glitter just don't do it as many times as I did just do it the one time on the correct setting unfeasible ink setting yeah I did put butcher paper over it the first time but it's pretty I could probably go back and cut out some pieces of my infeasible ink in this color area and just put over that I really didn't look I cannot see it at all on that I the dot I had a bigger piece that went on the black and it didn't work so you guys here's if you're gonna do a black canvas bag or this is a hundred percent cotton instead of cutting this out or I can see a little bit of an edge of the white instead of cutting it out twice I could have just put a big square of the in fusible ink over this and it would only stick to where the glitter is so I say that's the best thing to do you don't have to weed it out you can just put the sticker the fusible ink on the glitter iron-on in a big square and it would cover it all so I could probably do that again and just cut out that square and go over it another time and it would probably be brighter should I do it should i okay I'm answering the questions I gotta open up another box good thing I bought five of these boxes do you guys want me to do it I want to do it we're gonna test it not open it from the bottom yeah so I so I will know for sure if you guys should do it cuz boy now we got to come up with some ideas to use this part because now I have six of these sheets but I have to open I didn't use it all but I have to open a new pack instructions okay now where did I pull it the other one my left over from that wall can I stick it in here no oh here it is so I'm going to use this as a template of where to cut this it's still hot never surround me Oh Heidi says would it help to clean the glitter surface before applying that is something I never okay I'm gonna add a little tape to this and by adding the tape to this it's gonna ruin a little piece of that I'm just letting you know might not be something you want to do what I'm doing that video so I'm just gonna do the top corner it's not even gonna stick to it out thing no it doesn't even stick well that's nice Oh clip this clip will hold it Kelly can you give me some wonder clips I'm gonna clip these together so I know where to cut out the piece it will help a lot of people use these for sewing don't turn off yet okay so now I know where to cut it doesn't have to be exact but at least I kept gonna have the same colors a little bit it it might kind of ghost the colors like it's probably not going to be the exact colors in the exact spot but hey we might get a really cool effect okay oh now we're gonna have to put this down oh not that way make sure you do it the right way I'm gonna have to tape this down because now there's nothing to stick this to this let me try it right here so I'm going to use the Cricut resistible not resistible the Cricut heat resistant tape I ordered a new tape dispenser okay yeah we might have some blending of colors okay we're gonna need a lot of this - oh no okay and we need big pieces of tape we cannot be chintzy on the tape on this mic donuts right here but I think donut does not work well don't buy the donut so now I ordered a flamingo somebody showed me I ordered it from Amazon but somebody showed me you can't get them at the dollars tree for a dollar and so that's twelve dollars I paid for it on Amazon but I get it faster if I order from Amazon then me going to the Dollar Tree and I missed a little spot here it's okay alright we're gonna try this we're gonna put butcher paper over it make sure we don't get on any seams oh wait let's set the timer okay we're going for it yes I don't want you guys to waste product I have a problem with hoarding all these colors that I love so I'm good with them oh I didn't set the timer oh no I thought I did so I'm going to take it up about five seconds earlier penny so she can't look Oh somebody saw videos of the Dollar Tree tape dispenser doesn't work well well then I'll be buying another one okay Oh over the time because I was reading comments we're gonna let this cool I just picked it over here it's so pretty yeah yeah I think I just need a good old-fashioned good tape dispenser instead of all these QT ones Sally knows me are you really gonna let it cool I'm trying to read your guys's chat so I take my mind off letting it cool Oh penny wants to look okay oh it's coming up like it raises up oh my goodness oh look at how bright that is the ink I'll show it up close to make sure you guys can see you can see where it did not go it only went on the glitter iron on and you can see where my easy press was I got it covered all down here but not up here my easy press was not up there now I can still see these whiter spots because I just put more color into it I wonder how it work if we blended the opposite colors like if I took a strip and I don't know so you can't see it even in here there would be ink there if this was white you'd see it but you cannot see the income the black at all and ironing this so much and so long this vinyl iron-on might not last on a shirt through so many washings because you heated it up so much and sometimes that will make it lift so I'm just letting you know I don't know how long the glitter iron-on will last because we did not follow the instructions on the glitter iron-on well that's a bag I'm not gonna wash it that much ah bonnie is asking if you could use silver glitter iron-on I'm gonna try silver glitter sometime too so I think you can use silver glitter I'm not sure what the colors would look like it might look just like this I don't know if you want to test it on a sheet of something go I haven't do that when I do that I'll let you know yeah isn't it just so pretty and I love glitter but it is it does make this shirt heavier because it's it makes it hotter because of the glitter then fusible ink itself on the Cricut blanks don't do that you don't even feel the design so this is what's awesome about the invisible ink on the t-shirt is you don't feel it but if you want them on black the designs and you love glitter or like I do you can do this it's not pretty alright guys thank you so much for experimenting with me and try not new things I'm glad we did that what a holographic light color work I don't know I have no clue on if the holographic I only know that glitter works Jamie thinks the high heat would destroy the holographic so before you've ruined a shirt maybe test it on something else yeah Glenda that's why I was thinking buying a an actual tape dispenser that's good for an office desk alright guys I love you I'll see you saturday morning for a design space class let me know what you want to learn bye", "-32LirDBsTY": "Hello dear sewistas!\nToday I would like to sew a classic men\u2019s shirt with you. This is a great project for\nbeginners, which are looking to give working with jersey a first try. The shirt that we\nwill now be sewing has short, in-set sleeves, but you can also sew it with long sleeves.\nThe neckline is round and nicely serged on the back part. If you want, you can also sew\na little chest pocket and this nice button placket here. You can get the pattern for the men\u2019s shirt\nin our pattydoo designer. There you can also choose other options, for example one with\na V-neck or a shoulder yoke. To sew the shirt I use a serger machine\nby Pfaff. Further information on this machine can be found if you click on the link below.\nFurthermore, I also use a normal sewing machine, also from Pfaff, with an integrated upper\ntransport. Here too you will find more information by clicking on the link. You can also sew the whole shirt with the\nnormal sewing machine. Which settings you should be on the watch for, I show you in\nthe tutorial video for the shirt Elaine. I have already prepared the pattern pieces\nfor our shirt here. So here we have the back piece, the front piece, and both will be cut\nin the fold. Then we here have a right and a left short sleeve. Here is the strip for\nthe neckline and on top of that a short strip for tidying and here the little optional breast\npocket. We will now begin with the breast pocket,\nwhich we sew on to the front part. To do so we take the pocket, fold it right sides together\nand sew once around, whereby we leave a little gap here at the side, through which we can\nlater turn it right side out. I now sew with a jersey needle and a normal\nstraight stitch with a length of 2,5. The seam allowance is seven millimeters, so I\ncan just guide my piece along the presser foot edge. Here I leave the opening through which I will later turn the pocket. So, next we can cut off the seam allowances\nat the corners, turn the pocket right side out and iron it! The fabric edges at the little opening will\nnow be cleanly folded inwards and now I briefly iron over this part here.\nNext I quilt stitch the upper pocket edge in a distance of 1,5 centimeters or 5/8 of an inch. To do so, I take a slightly larger stitch length of 3,5. When positioning the pocket on the front piece\nI used the pattern for guidance and marked the correct position with a few pins. With\nthis fabric I can also orientate myself along the stripes. Now you can pin the pocket in place along\nthe lower edge. Or you can use this super practical doublesided tape. Then you can just\nstick the pocket on and nothing can slip! And now we will edgestitch the pocket onto\nthe front piece. Since we here have an uneven seam beginning, it is helpful to place a folded\npiece of fabric under the back part of the presser foot. And you can sew the pocket on, with a distance of 2 to 3 millimeters or 1/8 of an inch  from the edge. This is what the sewn on pocket looks like!\nIf the fabric is a bit out of shape here, you can just iron that flat. And now we will continue with the shoulder\nseams. To do so, we lay the front and back pieces right sides together and sew them together\nat the shoulders up here. I will now just place a few clips here. Next I will continue with the serger machine. Here the seam width is only seven millimeters. This is what the shoulder seams look like\nnow. In the next step, we will take the fabric strip for the neckhole, fold it right sides\ntogether and sew it together into a ring at the short ends here. This is now our ring for the neckline! And\nso you can nicely follow the next few steps, I will just explain the position of the notches.\nOn my ring the short seam now lies here , and will later meet up with the left shoulder.\nThen we have these two notches up here, with only a little distance between them. Here\nthe first notch will meet up with the center back and the next notch lines up with the\nright shoulder. The notch that lays beneath, the last one, will meet up with the center\nof the front piece. If, like I, you want the back part of your\nneckline to be nice and tidy, meaning that the seam allowance is covered up, then you\ncan now just sew another fabric strip on to your neck line. The strip is 2,5 centimeters or about 1 inch  wide and will be sewn on between the seam and shoulder notch. Lay the strip right sides together, exactly\non the edge of the nechline cuff and fold the ends over, so that the strip ends at the\nseam, or the shoulder notch. Then you can secure all of this with a few pins or clips. The secured strip we can now sew on to the neckline cuff with the sewing machine. I will now use a simple straight stitch about 5 millimeters or 1/8 of an inch close to the edge. This is what our guiding seam looks like now.\nNow the strip is sewn on we can comfortably secure our cuff at the neckline, aligning\nthe notches like I demonstrated earlier, with some pins or clips. To do so, we fold the cuff down the center,\nso the right side lies on the outside, and now secure it along the neckline\u2019s edge,\nand this on the right shirt side. I will begin up here in the center, whereby the strip we have previously sewn on now lies on top. Then we will continue with the next notch\nthat meets up with the shoulder seam. And this notch here aligns with the front\ncenter, which I also previously incised a little bit. The cuff seam here meets the second shoulder\nseam. The cuff ring is now secured on the right\nshirt side. The wrong fabric side lies on the outside. Here too you can see that the\nring is shorter than the circumference of the neckline. This is necessary, since the\nring will be stretched when we are sewing it on, so the neckline lies nice and flat\nlater. I now begin with seam at the back of the neckline. The cuff will be stretched to the length of the neckline hole while we sew. But make sure\nthat you do not stretch the shirt as well. And this is what the neckline looks like now\nwhen it has been turned. In the next step we will now just sew on a neatening strip.\nTo do so, I fold the shirt open again. And then I lay the strip around the seam allowance\nand secure it with a few pins. When everything is nicely secured, we can\nedge stitch this once around with the sewing machine. I will begin down here and sew in\na way that this edge runs closely next to the needle. Even if this step was a little bit of a challenge,\nit is really worth it, because I think it heightens the quality and appearance of the\nshirt. If this is too difficult for you however, then you can also omit this step. By the way, I used different colored threads\nfor my seam, the upper thread, so the one coming from the thread spool, is turquoise.\nAnd the bobbin thread here on the spool is brown. Now we can simply finish sewing the shirt,\nor if would like, you can now add a button placket to the neckline!\nAnd how this is done, I show you step by step in another video, which you can watch by clicking\non this link below. This is for example what the neckline with\na button placket can look like. And in the next step we will sew the sleeves to the armholes. We have a right and a left sleeve. And which\nsleeve belongs to which arm hole you can determine through the notches, the little incisions\nwhich you will have carried over from the pattern piece. Now lay the shirt open in front\nof you, so the right fabric side lies on top. Then take the sleeve and lay it on the shirt.\nIn doing so, the wrong fabric side of the sleeve lies on top and the right fabric side\nof the sleeve and also of the shirt are lying together on the inside. Now we pin the sleeve\ncurve to the arm hole, whereby the two notches of the front piece here meet up with the two\nnotches of the sleeve. And just like this all the other notches also\nlign up. And this notch here meets up with the shoulder seam. Here two differently shaped fabric edges are\nmeeting up, but since the fabric is very elastic, we can stretch this straight while sewing. While sewing the sleeve lies on top. So this is what the first sleeve seam looks like and in the same way we will now sew the other side. When you have sewn on the two sleeves, in\nthe next step you can close both the side seams. The shirt now lays with the wrong fabric\nside on the outside and now we can we can pin this edge together here, whereby the sleeve seams of the front and back piece will meet up exactly. If, like me, you have used a striped fabric,\nthen you should make sure that the stripes are nicely aligned. Potentially you could\nalso place a few pins, but make sure that these don\u2019t get caught in the blade. The side seam is now completed and exactly\nlike this we will now also sew the other side. When you have sewn both sides together, then\nyou can turn the shirt and last but not least sew the hems on the sleeves and down here.\nTo do so, we iron the fabric edges over by two centimeters to the wrong side. The seam\nallowance for this is already included in our pattern. You can secure the edge we have just ironed over with a few pins. The hem edge is now ironed over, and now you\nhave a few different options of how you can sew it on. The first option would be with\nthe serger machine. How this works I show you in my video to the shirt Liv. You can\nreach that by clicking the button. You can also sew the seam with a normal sewing\nmachine. For example, with an elastic stitch. This I show you in my video for the shirt Elaine. Or you can use a sewing machine with a twin\nneedle. This you can watch in our video about the children\u2019s dress. I will now show you a fourth option, which\nwill be sewing with the overlock machine with a flatlock stitch. To do so, we first have\nchange a few settings at the machine. First we remove a needle. Second, we flip up the\nblade as a safety measure. And then we have to adjust the thread tension. This machine\nhas an automatic tension regulator, with which all thread tension can be automatically set.\nThis I will set to E. On other serger machines you set the needle thread tension to very low, and the tension of the upper overlock hook to medium, and\nthat of the lower hook to very high. The best thing to do is check your instruction\nbooklet and test the different settings on a practice piece. The flatlock seam has two\ndifferent sides, and I would like that the ladder stitch is later visible on the outside. To do so, fold over the hem edge in a way\nthat the fabric edge lies precisely in the fold here. I now begin on the back piece,\njust before the side seam and lay the edges just so under the needle that they are hit\nexactly by the needle and the fabric looping takes place on the right and outside of the fabric. The needle should run as close to the edge\nas possible, but the distance should be wide enough so that the open fabric edge is nicely caught. Before I hit the beginning of the seam here, I cut off the thread chain. After this, we can fold this edge over here\nand pull everything flat. Then you can here see this ladder effect, which is partly a\nlittle bit uneven, but gives the shirt a particular aesthetic. In the same way I now sew the sleeve hems\non my men\u2019s shirt. The sleeve hem is easier to sew if you turn the shirt wrong side out.\nThen you can sew within the opening. And now our great men\u2019s shirt is done! I\nhope you had as much fun sewing it as I did. More sewing tutorials, in which I explain\neverything step by step, you can find here in my YouTube channel. And the correct pattern is available at pattydoo. Bye, and until next time!", "hfoawy9_ayg": "today I'm going to test out dye press poly tea spray sublimation coating for t-shirts which allows you to sublimate on cotton yes even 100% cotton t-shirts if you've been in the sublimation business for long you know this is a long awaited item I found out about dye press from a sublimation form and just had to give it a try I bought this bottle on Amazon for $64 it is concentrated and will make half a gallon of the solution I'm not sure how many t-shirts that will make but seems like it'll be quite a few after my purchase from Amazon I discovered that I could have purchased this for $30 from going to die press calm I believe plus the shipping I think was six or seven dollars but I'm not going to send it back to Amazon because I just really want to try it I already bought it it's here and I'll leave you with the information on where you can get it cheaper than Amazon in the description below well you will need for this process is of course the dye press poly T spray a light colored cotton t-shirt this one's actually ninety percent cotton it was cheaper I bought a pack of five of these for like under $12 at Walmart and you will need this spray bottle or something that will put a fine mist it doesn't really matter honestly because you have to get the whole thing completely soaked but I bought this fine mist one because someone had recommended it and you want to use distilled water so I'm supposed to have one ounce of the dye press Holi tea spray and seven ounces of water however my spray bottle my mister that I bought it does not hold seven ounces of water so I went a little bit under if you know that two tablespoons is about an ounce so I went a little bit under that for the one anyway to go with the six ounces of distilled water that I have going this in the my spray bottle already have that set up and ready to go now I'm filling it with six ounces almost to the top I'm just ready to shake it up and get ready to spray it on my shirt so I have my concoction here one ounce of the Die Presse poly tea spray and seven ounces of water give or take and I'm going to put a Teflon sheet inside my shirt because I only want to spray the front I don't want the back to get soaking wet and you're supposed to spray it until it is nice and damp let dry completely before you sublimate on it let's go my first time I have this continuous spray bottle of see how it work not too terribly continuous here's my t-shirt hanging up to dry in the bathroom didn't want to throw it in the dryer because I wasn't sure if that was allowed maybe I'll try that next time who knows brand-new dryer so I don't know if I want to okay now we take it apart and we're just gonna spray regular water through it so that the nozzle doesn't get clogged with the poly stuff because then it will ruin our sprayer and we don't want that then I'm gonna put the lid back on and save what I have left I almost used like half of the spray bottle so I used about a half an ounce just to get the front of that shirt way the directions that come with the the dye press do say to pre press for 15 seconds at 375 degrees so that's what I'm gonna do you know a lot of times I separate my designs into two pieces if I want it to be this was this way if I want it to be a little bit bigger than what my printer will print which is eight and a half by fourteen is the largest size it will print so I printed this on eight and a half by eleven I printed this on a larger legal size paper and then I cut them out and I can kind of put them together piece them together on there so that it has a bigger design make sure it is all pre pressed and I'm going to I'm just going to start out by laying the top one where it needs to go fits perfectly I have a smaller heat press mine's only 13 by 13 which I should have actually gotten a larger one so that's there I'm putting two pieces put your paper on as recommended and we press it with a heavy pressure for a minute and ten seconds so I did go ahead and put the second part of the design on there the first one turned out okay it was a little bit light I think I'm not sure if that's because we're doing it at 375 degrees instead of the usual 400 but that was what was suggested in those instructions so let's see how the whole thing turned out it does also say not to use the spray that makes it stick to the shirt use it and it sticks just fine alright so here we have it it's fine it's a nice shirt to wear to school when I'm subbing this is the school I'm subbing at and it's a little right I have to say I don't know if I would try it at a higher temperature next time but it definitely does work and I will I'll give it a go and I'll wash it too and I'll let you know how that turned out so here I am in my shirt that I just made it has been washed and dried it's a little white I think in the future I will experiment with temperatures because 375 degrees for dye sublimation is really a low temperature and that is what it the instructions said to use but I feel like it needs to feel hotter so the design is like the main thing I like about having this option with 100% cotton is that pilot percent polyester is not always available so in a pinch if you need a shirt you need to make some shirts for somebody you can just stop by Hobby Lobby in get a shirt they're always on sale so if you liked what you saw and you learn something hit that like button and subscribe and please stop by my website trespassing hits for more great hints on all things EE", "PDKQyzUb4zo": "[Music] I'm David gross back with you with another one of my tips and tricks for sublimation success if you watched a lot of our videos and done sublimation especially on on fabric shirts and things like that you know one of the challenges that we all have is the outline of where the transfer was and the outline is caused by the edge of the paper causing a permanent press crease and I'll show you what an example is in case you haven't seen one before but it's very difficult to prevent my videos if you review them I show you how to use for instance the vapor foam kit or Teflon pillow underneath the shirt so that the edges of the paper float and the edges of the paper aren't pressed in well somebody here Timlin I saw him pressing some shirts the other day and he had a new neato technique that I had never occurred to me and so I want everyone to try this and see if it works better than the cumbersome putting the the vapor foam kit underneath your shirt getting everything aligned I think this tip will will be very useful so I want to show you what the marks look like then I'll show you my technique okay here is that you can see the rectangle of where the paper was and it's been pressed into here and it's made just an ever so subtle permanent press crease into this shirt this crease will not wash out my new technique is to put a deckle edge on the paper and we're going to rip each edge so that we have a soft edge that doesn't bite into the shirt and it's very simple so we're going to just softly tear this thing and I've got an excuse for my tearing ability because I'm left-handed and so left-handers struggled with a little bit everything at least I do and so we're just making that soft edge right there and I did did go out and buy a deco ruler by the way and the deco ruler does a better job than then doing nothing but it still leaves a little bit of a mechanical edge so ultimately tearing it like this is the best now obviously you have to plan your design to give you some margin to tear so if your graphics go really really close to the edge you just have to be real careful with the tearing and so again the principle of the technique is to give the shirt a very soft edge here so that the edge cannot bite into the shirt now we're going to do this transfer twice once like this once without to just see the difference between the two and again using this technique we don't have to be so critical about pressure we can use like lighter pressure but we don't have to go real light like we would if we were using the vapor foam kit so we're going to dress the press here now I'm going to cut out a lot of little steps here just to expedite things I normally would lint roll the shirt and so forth but we're going to just jump in here and do our press we're going to press at 400 degrees 45 seconds with what I would call one-handed pressure one-handed pressure now we will pre-press the shirt just get wrinkles out and things like that when you check our pressure pressure so we're going to swing around here and pressure seems pretty good yeah like that pressure and now we're gonna do our transfer generally we would also pro-spray the transfer to keep it from moving with an open press I've gotten to where I can open things very soft softly without causing the transfer to move but I would always recommend the quick mist of pro spray so that when you do open the press and air rushes in the transfer doesn't flap if the transfer flaps it's going to move it's going to settle in a new spot it's going to cause a little bit of a shadow print okay we're done here we're gonna open things up very carefully pull off our transfer things look really good awesome awesome awesome looks good very difficult to detect an edge very difficult now we're going to flip it over and we're going to press it a second time with a standard transfer and we're going to compare it and see how we did also if I was doing this for real I would recommend that you put a piece of paper in between the layers of the shirt to keep bleed through coming through here so always a good shot all right we're gonna put our transfer on here and the cover sheet I'm going to use a new cover [Applause] by the way this paper that I'm using you can buy it it's very inexpensive paper you can buy it at sam's club and office supply place i call it uncoated white butcher paper it's just inexpensive paper does a great job all right normally what we would have to do if we were doing it the old way is would have to get the vapor foam kit pad put it underneath it we'd have to put a piece of paper on top get everything you know set up and we always would want the transfer to be slightly larger than the vapor but the actual artwork to be slightly smaller than the the vapor foam kit and that's that's just difficult to do it takes a lot of time and time is money and we also are looking for very good results and so one of our jobs here is every day is a new day we want to figure out how we can do things better today than we did yesterday the Japanese interesting ly enough have this concept years ago called Kaizen and that's exactly what it means means do things better do things just a little bit better every day than you did yesterday and all those improvements add up to be big improvements over time okay and so what we're going to do is I'm going to take it over at the table and then we'll do a close-up so you can see the results okay I know it's difficult on the camera to see these things but you can see the crease mark right here and you know a client would definitely see it I see it you would see it and so it's just it's not what we want to see and we don't expect a professional should be do better than this we're gonna flip it over and if you look here you're not gonna be seeing any crisp crease at all along here there's nothing there I love your feedback on this new technique I'm sure maybe the needs be tuned a little bit more maybe there's something I haven't thought about but I'm using it it's working for me I'd love to hear back from you please let me know what you think it D gross at Conde com thank you for watching our videos until next time [Music]", "yBFsh2hrZyQ": "but it's everyone welcome back to my channel and if you are new to my channel hello Horowitz oh my name is Sean and yet welcome so for today's video I'm going to be doing a little bit of a DIY with you guys I haven't done idea why I feel like in forever a slowly hybin year and it's like ever since when I first started like my youtube channel I know I did a little DIY on like cutting your sleeves off your shirt to kind of make it a muscle shirt I was really big into that but today I'm going to be showing you guys how to crop your shirt so instead of cut the sleeves off dead ones we're gonna cut shirt across let me show you how I end up doing that cuz there are definitely ways where you can mess it up and especially if you only have one shirt then that's what you got so you just go work with it I really am big into like high-waisted like yellow pants especially like working out or high-waisted shorts and look that I like to pair it with a crop top I just feel like it looks super cute with the combo together found this shirt at Target and I thought it was super super super cute this one right here soo simple gray and I love that it says savage on the front of it but the way that the shirt kind of tails off into it is more like a high-low I love the loose clothes and I like loose-fitting things on me but the way that this shirt is I just feel like it's just too big and whatever so I figured I'm definitely when I saw I was like if I'm getting this I'm definitely gonna cut it into a crop top just have basically the word Savage shown and then everything else below that it's gonna be cut off except some some it really depends on how short you want your crop top to be and I'll show you how I end up kind of guesstimating figuring out how high I do want the crop top if you are wondering this is in a size medium but like I said I do like my shirts a little loose what I do to kind of measure is just to make sure that I line and he it shoulder seams together and then I will pretty much guess to me my belly bump is covered with the high-waisted so I don't want it to go I don't want the cut to go too far up but I also don't want it to be like too far low as well that makes any sense at all finally my belly button and that is basically where I'm just going to give it a trim on the shirt if you want and if you do feel comfortable with marking it you can mark it put it on if you aren't really into guesstimating and you just want it to be perfect definitely put it on and measure it out I ain't no time for that I'm just gonna cut it I do want to mention that it's always best to cut lower so if you do need to cut it and bring it up like an inch you can like have the room to cut it because once you cut this shirt completely that's it that's all you got if it's too short it's definitely too short so you're just going to make it work so like I said we're gonna go ahead and line it up and then I find my belly button I kind of like show you that's exactly where I want it right right here and then I'm just going to fold it just like so and that gives me a pretty good idea of the length that I do want my shirt let's start cutting I have it folded at the link that I do want the shirt and I'm going to just turn it sideways so one side is like facing me you're gonna let some scissors I got these extra heavy-duty scissors there I don't know utility scissors they cut through pretty much anything so I'm definitely going to be using a mat just to make things easier if you do want to give yourself a little bit of extra leeway just in case you feel like you don't want to cut too high and obviously we're in the shirt then go ahead and just kind of give it an extra half an inch or an inch of of extra room go ahead and just take my scissors and it just cuts true right across in this line and make sure that you do have some tension on the scissors and on the fabric just so the cut isn't too wobbly and make it like super and even as you can see I'm just going to cut straight across as I'm cutting I'm also pulling on the fabric of the shirt just so the cut just gets tight and it makes it easier to cut the shirt as well we just cropped a shirt so all this extra room I don't know if you want to recycle it you can if you want to turn it into a headband go for it do what you do with extra fabric and getting back to the crop top I'm just gonna go ahead and show you how it cut and then I kind of like it to be a little ruffled at the ends of it so I'm just gonna go ahead and just pinch and pull and that is just gonna make edges of the shirt just kind of roll up and give it that more like naturally distressed look I know throwing it to wash it definitely helps it with that as well but if you want to wear the shirt now this is definitely key in doing so it's just kind of pinching and pulling the fabric just so it does do that whole Rolly thing there you know that is how I cut up a shirt and I'll go ahead and put it on just so I can show you guys how it looks on me I am back and as you can see I do have the crop shirt on right now this is like literally the perfect length like when a crop top is not too long where it just hangs right over like literally two or three inches over the high-waisted area but you know just enough where you can see just a little just a little bit of skin here is what it looks like in the back and yeah like literally love the way it looks now we're taking a little bit more my style instead of having it super long I guess that is everything for this video like this video if you found it helpful and definitely let me know how it goes if you crop your shirt follow me on Instagram Twitter Facebook I will have all that listed right here and I'll have all the information listed down below as well thank you so much for watching and I'll see you my next video bye", "e-UOc9RHdAY": "hi I'm Sonia some sustained my craft cabinet I'm going to show you how to make t-shirt yarn using a whole t-shirt so with as little waste as possible this t-shirt yarn that I need here was made with only producing this much weight so very little needs to be thrown away and I get as a most yarn possible that I can out of this t-shirt there's really nothing else that it can be used here so I'm going to show you how to do that this was made with a men's size medium t-shirt plain grey t-shirt what is great about this is that the future was very old and pretty well well worn and has holes and rips in it really not anything you would want to go outside wearing really next up was either to throw it away or to use it as ray so this way now I have a ball of yarn that looks great and can be used to knit and crochet in some my other projects that I'm going to do all you really need to get started is a cotton t-shirt with or without the spoons on the side a measuring tape and a really good pair of sharp scissors this makes all the difference when it comes to how easy it's going to be to cut your shirt to use instead a rotary cutter with a hard edge ruler start by placing your t-shirt nice and flat in front of you with the front side facing up then you're going to cut a straight line across the chest underarms point to the other underarm point and then move that aside next we want to remove the sleeve by cutting along the arms you'll see it doesn't matter if you do it on the inner side of your feet or on the sleeve side part of the scenes just be consistent and once you've cut put it aside and do the other sleeve [Music] teacher should now be and for substances next we're going to trim the shirt to be able to move on to the next step which is going to cut the actual strips of the t-shirt yarn to start by snipping off those seams at the arms on both sides we want to cut a close to the scene are as possible because the rest of the t-shirt is usable for your teacher and next you want to remove the neckband by cutting along the next scene and you're going to throw this part away as it's not usable for the t-shirt yarn although you may want to use it for a different most people will just cut off with speed and bottom hem of the t-shirt but there's actually a lot of fabric in here that can use you really don't need to end stitch the hem all you need to do is insert your scissors into the hem and cut all the way around along the inner side of the kitchen and then unfold that you have a little bit more Nora - you kind of worry about removing the leftover stitching on the shirt because once we cut the strip's and you stretch the t-shirt out it will get hidden in the remainder of the yarn and you won't even notice it [Music] you [Music] we are now ready to start cutting the strips in the fabric so we're going to start with the largest piece which is the torso piece and lay it out flat in front of you with the bottom and top edges at the side now that your shirt is nice and smooth you're going to take the slide that's closest to you which is actually the side one side of the t-shirt original t-shirt and fold it over to be about one and a half inches from the other side the other folded edge of the t-shirt with a good pair of fabric scissors to begin to cut 3/4 inch wide strips pulling from one side of the fabric to the other just to make sure you stop cutting about one inch from the folded edge let's harvest away from you this is to make sure that the t-shirt yarn will make a continuous strand when we go to form it continue cutting the strips all the way across your piece of fabric until the end if you have a thicker t-shirt you may want to cut narrower strips such as half inch thick because there's more fabric there to form the yarn list to cut the strips in the sleeve section lay the piece in front of you with the long edge closest to you you'll want to just snip the hem at the scene a little bit to make sure that you can unfold it and lie it flat when the edges of your hem are lined up and your pieces nice and smooth fold the food section over just like you did with the bottom large section lining up the edge of the sleeve pins cut 3/4 inch wide strips and stop about half an inch to one years away from the food in food which is a section that's away from you continue cutting along the sleeve until we get to the end of the into parts you really want to open up the whole thing and continue cutting the strips in the free cap portion now set this leave aside and repeat this whole process with the second please [Music] we're now moving on the final section of the shirt which is the upper t-shirt portion you want to lay it flat in front of you facing upward and then fold it in half with the front side out again you want to cut three-quarter inch wide thick strips all the way to about an inch away from the armhole edge you don't want to cut all the way through or else you won't be able to make a continuous strand of yarn only go as far as about one inch from the front neck edge of the church it's now time to cut those shredded sections of t-shirt if you continue points of yarn start by completely opening up that upper torso part of the shirt we're going to work on the front side and cut the edges in a zig zag pattern alternating pattern this is important to make sure that we get that continuous piece of having little stretches of yarn now you want to repeat this process is the fast part of the upper torso of the shirt as well as the remaining shoulder piece that you had from the front side this maximizes the amount of t-shirt yarn you can get from your shirt if you've ever had a chance to crochet or knit with t-shirt yarn you'll appreciate that it's a completely different texture even in the end product from other types of yarn and one of the beauties of using t-shirt in the mix the stretch fabric is that it's quite forgiving so you don't have to be exact in terms of the width of the sections that you're cutting you can see and we get to the ends up kind of needs a little bit that the length of the yarn are quite narrow that's fine because once we stretch it out and the next segment then you won't be able to tell me once you've completed and made the big ball of yarn [Music] next we're going to move on to the squeeze segment so you want to start by opening up the sleeve and laying flat the section that you didn't cut through namely the inseam of the shirt sleeve and you want to lay that part flat with that bottom seam completely opened up you want to start at the inseam and cut a diagonal to open up the first strand of yarn then you want to continue connecting those cuts that you need before in a diagonal manner across that in to and this is what's going to make a continuous piece of yarn rather than circles when you get to the fleas cast portion just open it all up and follow by eye how the screen area should go and then that will tell you where it needs to be cut again just trim off any of the excess fabric on the corners and continue this whole process with the other sleeve with you now we're onto the biggest section of the t-shirt which is the most gratifying because you're going to get the most yarn here following the same process as we did for the sweet section start by cutting a diagonal for your first strand and then connect the slices that you cut before diagonally to join your continuous strand of yarn and you just want to continue this until you get to the top of Beyond and there you go one long piece [Music] next is the most fun part for me and that is actually taking all these strips of fabric that you've made and forming them into your t-shirt yarn and it's super simple just hold the fabric in both hands and gently stretch it and you can see as you stretch it that the fabric kind of rolls in on itself to form what looks like yarn this process is the same for any shirts or sections that have scenes in them you just want to be a little gentler when you cuz on those areas to make sure that you don't pull it apart the nicest thing is to really have one continuous strip so to connect now these five sections that you need and there are a number of different ways you can do it mainly you can cut a little segment and join the two ends or you can sew the pieces together but honestly we've found this approach of just nodding the two ends together to work just fine and in your piece when you're using the yarn in the end you can just hide those knot [Music] and that's pretty much it and if you keep your yarn from becoming a huge tangled mess you may want to start from the outset making a little ball and just keep working around and so you have your nice big t-shirt gun [Music] great job that's it that's all it takes to make your own t-shirt yarn using the whole t-shirt with as little waste as possible this is the waste I have leftover from the t-shirt I cut up really not much left there and now I'm getting a multi on possible to use on other projects I'm going to make I hope you enjoyed this video if you have any questions let us know and we'd love to see the project you make to share them with us for more project ideas and other be our lives check out sustain like rabbit comm thanks for watching", "RFkX9FO4dyE": "[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you welcome back you guys I'm Lisa with Lisa Katelyn quilts and today we are going to show you how to stabilize your t-shirts in the process of making a t-shirt quilt I have been asked what kind of stabilizer I use for my t-shirt quilts and I will just show you just to let you know there are many on the market and it's really a personal preference the one I like the most and I've tried a bunch of them it's the pellon P 44 F it's apparel interfacing and it's fusible and it is very lightweight you see it's just very very light one of the reasons well there's a couple reasons why I like this one first it is super light and easy to use and it does not add a ton of weight to your quilt now you already know your t-shirts already weigh a lot ok they are much heavier than dealing with your normal like quilters cotton so you already have some weight to your quilt and this you're gonna stabilize all of your shirts does not add hardly any weight to your quilt top whatsoever another reason jo-ann's is like three minutes from my house and they carry this by the bolts so I do buy it by the bolts and I use a 50% off coupon and so that saves me a bolt of this unopened is 48 yards at 99 cents a yard and you can see that's almost $50 you guys for a bolt of this however if you use a coupon you can get that for half off and that this goes a very long ways and so that's one of the other reasons why I like to use this I've used some other ones and they are more expensive and they're thicker and heavier and so if you're looking to make a quilt that is very heavy for cold cold cold seasons you might want to check some of those out this for me just works I like the weight of it I like the fact that it doesn't add any weight to my quilts I use this usually like a very high loft batting in my quilts anyways and so by the time you have the t-shirt top the quilt top and the interfacing the batting and the backing of your quilt it's a really a really nice weighted quilt anyway so let's get started I have already cut my t-shirts if you are interested in seeing that video I'll put a link to that video down below so you can check that out I've already got my t-shirts cut and I went ahead and counted how many blocks I'm going to need we're doing a simple block style quilt we're gonna need a 24 locks for this quilt and so I went ahead and pre-cut my stabilizer to me it just saves time to already have the stabilizer cut a little bit bigger than the block size that I need so that when I get to the iron I'm just pressing and usually I'll turn on some music and press away so let's get started what I like to do you can use the ironing board but usually there's a cover on there that has some padding and so I like to use a pressing board and this I made or my husband gave me a spare piece of wood and I covered it with a towel and then wrapped it in some cotton fabric which I change out periodically because I do use the glues and stuff and stuff you know spray starch it it all gets on here so I changed this out and wash it and it's easy to do because I just tuck it up underneath but it gives me a nice firm pressing surface and I like the width of it because this is usually a little bit bigger than my boat block and so it gives me a nice pressing surface for the whole logo of the t-shirt so when I get started I usually try to Center my logo sometimes you can see the logos through the backside of the shirt just Center it on my pressing board now you guys each stabilizer is different and each one of them has their own a set of instructions so I highly suggest you read them they all could be different I'm just showing you the method that I use with the stabilizer that I showed you you'll notice the fusible interfacing or stabilizer has a bumpy side and a smooth side you want to make sure the bumpy side is facing to your fabric or else you can pretty much go out and buy a new iron ask me how I know that all right we are putting the bumpy side down onto our t-shirt material I'm just making sure that there's no wrinkles or bumps and everything is nice and smooth I have turned my iron on again read your instructions for the stabilizer you're using I have put mine on a setting of 6 and I have turned the steam on now I'm using steam because I will lay a piece of muslin fabric over top of this and it helps me to move the iron around strings everywhere I'm a clutter so the muslin on top of that helps me move this around and I can use the steam and it really helps fall onto the adhesive to the t-shirt you see that Stan I have put my hair back today if you are not using this muslin because you really don't have to I probably wouldn't use the steam though you guys because it tends to want to stick to your stabilizer and pull it when you go to move your iron and so I have just found for the ease of use to use just a pair a spare piece of fabric we all have that laying around and it really does help when you were ironing the stabilizer down now of course each stabilizer like I said is different and it has different pricing times I've used this so much that I know just by touch when it is good and I you know bonded with the fabric and using the steam helps you want to make sure you get all of the edges really good and bonded you can see I'm really not moving the iron on the fabric it might look like I am but I'm really lifting it up slightly and moving the iron so that I'm not moving and shifting the t-shirt underneath there are a lot of different ways that you can make a t-shirt quote when I first started I had purchased a book on how to make t-shirt quilts and they actually said not to use stabilizer so I was like okay I'm not gonna use stabilizer and I made the quote and it turned out good but it was so hard you guys if you know if you've cut the t-shirt material already then you know the edges want to do a little curling or roll up and if you're trying to sew that is so difficult so it only took me two or three quilts to realize we're gonna use stabilizer I went through a variety of different kinds of stabilizer and talked on my favorite and for me this was it because it is so lightweight and when that the quilt is all done and quilted and washed you do not feel any stiffness with the stabilizer so you can see there's a lot of drape with the shirt see it folds over very easily so it's not stiff at all but it does add a lot of stabilization so when you cut your block the edges are nice and perfectly straight you can cut them nice and square and nothing is going to stretch out of shape even while you're piecing your quilt top so we just set that aside and move on to the next one so if you guys have any questions about this process or the stabilizer that I use you can leave them down below I do know that watching these types of videos helps a lot when you're new or just starting a project and you haven't done it before or if you've only done it a few times and you run into issues and you're like you know what's a different way to do this these tutorials help and so I'm hoping that by doing these videos here that you have found something or some information that is useful again you don't have to use this pressing sheet matter of fact I don't believe the instructions for this stabilizer that I'm using calls for it but I find that that it just burns so much easier if I use it and I use this team so whoo it doesn't hurt the t-shirt at all it doesn't hurt the stabilizer in fact I find that it bonds faster and stronger and I have less areas that did not bond with the t-shirt material this way so if you have any tips that you might like to share you can post them down below we are all different you guys and I'm a part of several different quilting communities online and there are some really fantastic people and teachers out there who love to share information so if you are ever doing a project and you're not sure what to do I highly suggest that you join some of those groups or you find some really inspiring teachers on YouTube there are a lot of them out there what I find interesting is that each person sort of has their own way of doing things and I like that because I don't believe that there's one a set of rules that everyone must follow and doing anything and that's quilts included and what might work for me may not work for you but the fact that people are out there sharing all these different things is what I love the most hey guys you can see it's just as simple as that and it is all bonded and on there and we're ready to move on to the next one and I would do one more with you guys and then I will turn off this camera and turn on some music I'm a person who is motivated by music and when you work by yourself all day it helps a lot so again the bumpy side facing your t-shirt material make sure all the wrinkles and tucks and puckers for out you're not really stretching the t-shirt material when you're doing this you're just making sure that it's nice and flat and smooth and nothing is tucked up underneath of itself there was some interesting music playing maybe this video would not be so boring and that's why we're only going to do a few shirts for this video you guys but I just really wanted to see or to show you how simple this part is and show you the stabilizer that I use so I went in and got myself some coffee after shooting the last video where I cut apart the shirt and I'm feeling a little bit more energized and warmed up I'm sure there's something else that I wanted to explain about this process it's usually when I turned the camera off I'm like oh I wonder if I mentioned that should have said that if there's something really important that I'm leaving out check the comments you never know I might say something about it but this is really it you guys lots of ironing to go through it today as you can see it really doesn't take that long and it's like a good spot a with the steam going on and there we go and you can see it will make your life way easier using the stabilizer there are videos out there were just a couple actually really that the quilt makers don't use the stabilizer they're hard to find and I'm not gonna make I'm not going back all right you guys I'm gonna go ahead and finish ironing all of these t-shirts and get busy with the designing phase of this t-shirt quilt I hope that you have found this helpful it's not like a huge discovery video but it might help someone who is just starting out and I know that when I was starting I really wish I had come across some videos to show me some tips and tricks and that I didn't have to learn the hard way and now there's all these resources out there that can help you guys and so maybe this will be one for you and if maybe if you found some other videos that are helpful you can let you know link them down below in the comment section hope you guys have a great afternoon and I stay tuned for future videos by you guys"}
