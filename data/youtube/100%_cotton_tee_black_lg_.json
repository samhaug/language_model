{"rQivpKEG73k": "Look at this side-by-side photo of these\nthree tees. Which one is the softest? This one is $1.50 this one is $2.50 and this one\nis about $3.00. How could you ever tell without touching and feeling\nthem? The softness of a shirt has everything to do with the little details\nthat improve the quality of the fabric. In this video we're gonna explain the\ndifferences between the different grades of cotton. What's the difference between\ncarded open end, ring-spun and airlume combed and ring-spun anyway? We're about to\nexplain why the type of cotton matters and which kind to look for in this\nepisode of our series Us vs. Them. If you like this series so far go on and\nhit that subscribe button. Let's start with the worst type of cotton. It's\ncalled Carded Open End or COE for short. This type of cotton is super cheap,\nmaking it the cotton of choice for the one to two dollar tees of the world.\nIt's scratchy, heavy, stiff... kind of feels like the love child of a burlap sack and\na T-shirt. Now let's move on to ring spun. As fewer and fewer people were willing\nto settle for COE, manufacturers started making ring spun cotton.\nPeople often throw out the label ring spun and combed and ring spun\ninterchangeably, but these types of cotton are not the same. When cotton is\npicked there are a lot of impurities in its raw form. It's a plant so you have\nsoil and plant matter and it's just all-around dirty. If cotton is ring\nsponge but not combed and ring spun it means that all those impurities are spun\nup into the yarn. Whereas with combed and ring spun cotton\nthe raw cotton goes through a refining process to get rid of those impurities.\nWhat ends up happening is you lose a lot of the original cotton, resulting in a\nsmaller yield and costing manufacturers. But in the end you get a much better\nproduct. For you visual learners, just compare this photo (which is like ring\nspun cotton) to this photo (which is like combed and\nring-spun cotton). If cotton isn't combed it results in a tee that is hardly soft\nand a print surface that's less than optimal. Wondering where airlume cotton\nfits in this mix?At Bella+Canvas we go a step further with our airlume cotton to\nachieve something even more premium than combed and ring-spun cotton. First, we comb\nout 25% of the cotton we start with because we have super high standards for\nwhat constitutes as clean cotton. With most combed cotton only a small\npercentage of the impurities are actually removed. Then using only the\nlongest staples of cotton we spin yarn that has less stray fibers resulting\nin the smoothest print surface possible. Bottom line there's no cotton that's as\nsoft as our signature airlume combed and ring spun. So next time you're\ndeciding between a few tees make sure to pay attention to the type of cotton and\nmake sure it's airlume, the most premium blend of combed and ring-spun. It's just\nanother thing that separates Us from Them. Next week in this series we're\ngonna unravel the mystery of why your shirts are shrinking and let you in on\nthe secret as to why ours don't.

you're new and if you are already a dreamer welcome back welcome back welcome back okay y'all i'm geek today i'm excited today i am going to be using this poly acrylic i'm going to be using this some good old h2o and i'm going to be sublimating on a hundred percent cotton shirt so i'm gonna do two i'm gonna do gold because i'm feeling bold and i'm gonna do white you see this white so these are just your classic gildings i don't know about this when it's a heavy cotton these are classic guildens 100 gildan excuse me 100 cotton shirts both of them are 100 percent content now both 100 content and we're just gonna see and what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna show you the image that i'm gonna use but i'm excited so what we're gonna do is we're going to use um this is spray bottle i got from the dollar store gonna use eight ounces of water and we're gonna use two tablespoons of this poly acrylic okay so the finish i'm doing is clear satin they have matte they have a bunch of different ones but this is the one i'm using so we gonna see how this one go okay okay so this is the image that i'm going to be using and now i just want to see how i want it on the shirt um the shirt is gonna be a medium shirt i typically really wear i could wear a medium large or extra large depending on how i want the shirt to fit i just grabbed a medium that was the first one i chose so i'm trying to figure out i think i'm going to duplicate it just in case i mess up i'll have the original copy right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to stretch it out a little bit i'ma see if i could do it because i like the page flip this way but i'm gonna see if i could stretch the image out a little bit just so i can wear it the way i want okay so right now we're just playing with the size so that's something you always want to be sure of when you're creating things how it's going to look on the shirt so remember the area that i spray you want to make sure you can actually see the image right so i'm letting it air dry then i'm probably going to just blow dry it to make sure it's all the way dry and soft and not like hard because if it air dry it'll probably be hard so i could throw it in dryer or blow dry it whatever i'll probably just blow dry because i don't feel like going down there so i mean i'm just keeping it real y'all know that's what i do so i'll make sure that i have enough of the image um so it can be this way yes i'm just doing like this now a few things this neon which i'll talk about later when i print it out it's not going to be neon because i don't have neon ink sublimation ink they do have it i just don't have any so it's going to that green is not it's probably gonna come out looking like this down here green okay so i do know that so i want the colors to pop but i know neon won't show because i don't have the colors to mix to make that so it'll be a different variation of it so i'm going to go ahead and send this to my epson workforce 7720 um and i'm going to do two of them because remember i'm doing it um i'm a print twice because i'm doing it on my um the gold shirt too just because i got to be fancy i don't know i just said i wanted to try it just to see how it would stick on that one too so we are going to y'all know i have presets already my popping colors i'm doing this in cassette 2 because that's where my larger paper is i'm printing two copies and yeah so that's the image we're gonna print it out i'm gonna come back once it's printed out and dry and we gonna get this thing popping ten all right stay tuned okay so what i'm going to do is i'm going to put one tablespoon in first then i'm going to put the eight ounces of water then i'm going to put the second tablespoon okay then i'm going to close it up and ignore that that's just my makeup and then i'm going to make sure it's closed and i'm going to shake it up shake it up shake it up shake it and that's literally all you have to do make sure this is closed clean everything up shake it up a little bit and that's that ready to go okay y'all so guess what i have put my um shirt up under the heater sounds like maybe while i'm recording the um other portion that it'll help dry a little bit it completely dry so if this will completely dry now i will say it's not soft like if i put in a dryer like i literally can feel where the poly is which actually is a good thing because now i know where i can lay my image so my first picture came out this is the asap paper today this is what we'll be using is asap today and this is the image it came out so good look at that that looks amazing right so and actually that neon remember i said it was ago it looked a little bit yeah so show me so anywho this image came out looking so good this is uh so i'm going to um dry the yellow shirt but we might as well go ahead and do this so let's do this one first so i'm about to go ahead and do it it's on 400 degrees 60 seconds if you missed it you can rewind it but i have poly acrylic i put two tablespoons um and eight ounces of water here i was safe i had my gloves so the shirt is dry it's completely completely dry this is that can you hear this so you can hear it so it's completely dry i'm going to go ahead and um uh put it under heat press for a couple seconds i'm so excited y'all then i'm gonna do it and see how it turned out then we still gonna do the gold one but we gonna do this one since we're here so let me go ahead and set this up and move in move you guys in closer all right y'all let's see how this turned out this is my first oh snaps oh my goodness oh my goodness now i just threw it on there y'all saw that look oh yo i'm so good look at that and this is 100 cotton shut the noise oh my god are so good oh mine turned out so good look at this y'all stop playing with me shut up this this image i just found on google too i literally just found this on google okay so let's rewind what i did yo i'm tsugi okay let's rewind [Music] poly acrylic mine was clean satin i got this from lowe's eight ounces of water two tablespoons of poly acrylic and then i put this under the heat press so i actually laid it up under the heat press while i was doing the other portion i think it was like maybe six minutes not even 10 i don't think it dried it completely and then y'all i'm sorry i have my sucker y'all know i always be whatever and then look at this so i'm gonna do a wash test i'm not gonna do it today but i'm gonna do a wash test so we can see what happens but we gonna do that gold but baby we gotta just let's take a minute to just admire this real quick i might put this on today so it was a success if you want to do this for just like a day for an event let's say you're doing a walk let's say you have something you want to use um as far as being toxic i did hear that because it's only two tablespoons and diluted in eight ounces of water and then we shake it up it's not a whole lot of the poly acrylic that's in here it's diluted with eight ounces of water right so it's two tablespoons eight ounces of water we shake it up so it's not like it's really harsh or toxic um do this on your own wrist i don't have anything you know i'm not a dermatologist or a doctor or anything like that so i'm not saying that you would do it i feel comfortable enough to do it for myself so you don't try this at home that's my disclaimer but for me because i didn't use that much i would feel comfortable putting it on myself even if i just had a undershirt or something on under here to make myself feel better but yeah so we gonna try this gold out so i'll be back oh why the gold is getting dry real quick guess what it's not hard no more so it feel it make a little bit it's not hard like how it was i don't know if the heat did something to it but it feels feels good it's not like crisp or crunchy or anything like that y'all okay we're gonna let that finish dry i'll be back all right i'm back yes i'm getting yes i did put it on excuse i got some makeup on there so excuse that that's just the makeup but 100 cotton size medium image from google shout out to whoever was the artist makeup by me messing up my list whatever so now we're just going to see this this might be a fail let's just prepare ourselves this one might not work but it's okay because this one did okay so we're just gonna see all right and you do want to put um butcher paper in the middle of it i ain't doing it for right for right now because i'm just not but you do want to put so anytime you sublimate you want to put butcher paper in between the images on top of it to protect everything this just for the for myself my i'm not doing it right now um i just ordered some more butcher paper actually from amazon and it just came in the mail today so we're preserving the butcher paper this is gonna be mine too so that's not 100 perfect it's fine does this just flow on me okay so recap while we wait for these 60 seconds um two tablespoons of poly acrylic two tablespoons poly acrylic mine was um clear satin i don't know if that matters or not that's what mine was eight ounces of water our gloves to be safe shake it up shake it up shake it up shake it spray it dry it i put that under the heat press it dry it dried the whole thing in less than 10 minutes but you can put it in your dryer you can use a blow dryer you could um use a fan hey whatever you air dry it whatever works for you i put it under my heat press though and um cosmos ink guild and shirts 100 cotton yeah i'm so excited y'all i'm like literally hyped over this that was 60 seconds let's see you see that's why i use that butcher paper you see that that's why you use the butcher paper okay and like i thought the gold shirt is different it went but the colors because it's gold it did it the black work but because all those other colors on the go it didn't it didn't go but now you know so people i can't do it on dark because i went in my group real quick i went

this cotton subs it's a fabric material that you can heat press sublimation onto and put it onto a dark colored shirt or light-colored shirt picked it up from tank by customs we just doing it on box and check it out we're gonna do press it on the t-shirt just to see how it works out see if it actually works sticks and if you haven't already like comment subscribe man I see Paris I see y'all in a second so cotton swabs cotton sublimation transfer material pick this up from tag bar customs what it is Oh smart invoice was uh $33.80 410 cotton side sheets so there's a good price listening there chance she's 33 or a 30 she's 1996 50 sheets for 137 81 so he's supposed to be able to serve on this and the other sub on cotton dark 11 only ordered the team's just to see how it's going to work out I'm not even sure what it is let's see exactly okay so it's a sublimation material so polyester feeling tell it all so this paper says this revolutionary technology now allows printing directly unto cotton material great for both light and dark colors with the supersoft field to the touch application directions pre-press the garment which a professional-grade heat press for five to eight seconds and to eliminate wrinkles and moisture step 2 place the cotton sub with the rough side down on top of the garment okay so yes definitely this is the rough side so you will place that down step three mirror print a design on sublimation paper if using step four if using a colored shirt make sure your design completely covers the cotton sub or goes a little outside of the material so no white is visible after application if using a white shirt make sure your design says inside the material to eliminate ghosting put the printed sublimation paper over the cotton sub press at 375 at 385 degree for 60 seconds any temperature peel is fine if using that he sub sublimation paper a delay peel is best wait at least 24 hours before washing turn inside out when you laundry for longer-lasting best results hand wash inside out after application do not iron on top of the cotton Sun directly and heat wool from solid I got my glasses on reactivate the ink if you need to press it do it inside as out as well if iron it on top of the material put parchment butcher or regular paper on top of the cotton sub and hiring as needed we're gonna have to get us a Tesla [Music] just wanna measure this out see how big it is so the size is 16 and a half by eleven and a half whether we go with it so I said the rough side damn and you can clearly clearly feel it what size smaller size rock so I'll just cut more straight down a middle just to see how it goes y'all know is going to work out but this is just a print but it don't work right but for the sake of practice and so I say that do we 85 for 60 seconds see what I do it works stretching it's not too bad you can really tell is just a piece on top of it it's kind so pick that up at our tech by customs yeah that's not too bad get it down get the right print going stuff yeah homework it's right there man it's not too bad pulling on his stress tone and look like it's gonna stick you know we're gonna see how I do I didn't use the best print I was a print I messed up on because the one I actually printed out was too small so I just had that one a print that came out back but anyway we just put it down and actually sub down there the material actually he pressed onto the shirt so that I got it from tagged by customs check them out I got 10 of those for $33 per day like coming subscribed man see parents $12 per LM go",

subscribe all that good stuff hit the bell so that you get notified any time that i upload i try to upload at least one to two times a week sometimes more if i have time but at bare minimum one to two times a week um what we're going to do today is we are going to try sublimating on 100 cotton that's right 100 cotton um now i know like the first cardinal rule of sublimation is you have to have polyester but somebody not sure who to give the credit to created this solution um spray solution that you spray onto your cotton shirt and it allows you to sublimate onto the cotton basically the solution that you spray onto the shirt adheres to the cotton fibers of the shirt and allows the those fibers to be able to grip the ink so that you can sublimate on the shirt um is that's the information i got from the person that i purchased the solution from um that was the description that they gave and how it actually works so this is my first time trying it out with you guys i have not tried it on any other shirt before um and i felt like this was a perfect image to do i got this from a young lady in a craft group i'm in i purchased it from her um i can't remember her name off the top of my head i'm gonna have to look at my email and um i will leave her name in the description box so if you're interested in this image you can purchase it from her um but yeah this is the image i'm going to go ahead and use um i am going to mirror this because we know a sublimation we have to mirror i already have it have it sized out i'm going to be doing a 10 by 14 and a half and this is going to be on a large shirt i believe a large fruit of the loom um white 100 cotton shirt so i'm gonna go ahead and get this printed out i'm gonna come back and show you guys how i do it and we're gonna see if it works so stick around to see if we uh get it together all right guys so i am back here um i do have my image printed out here and then i have my this is my cotton t-shirt let me show you it's a haze i'm sorry it's a fruit of the womb platinum 100 cotton t-shirt 100 cotton um so that is what i'm going to attempt to silver on today um i do already have my butcher paper inside of my shirt to prevent any bleeding um okay and then i have my solution here i just put it in a spray bottle it came in a bottle this is the bottle that it came in and i put it inside of this spray bottle it's a hair um i've been using this for like just a water bottle for a while now but i put it inside of this to you know be able to easily spray it onto my shirt and i will link in the description box the etsy shop that i purchased this solution from so you guys can check it out if you want to okay so the first thing i'm going to do because this is cotton i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to do a um i'm going to let roll it and then i'm going to do a quick uh pre-press [Music] make sure my shirt is straight okay i'm gonna do a quick like 10 second um pre-press just to make sure all the moisture is um out of my shirt okay and now because my image is so big i'm just gonna place it on here i'm not gonna cut it i'm not gonna tape it or not i'm sorry i didn't even spray it gotta spray it first i'm just gonna give my solution a shake and then i'm going to spray the whole area you don't want it to be soaking wet you want it to be a little damp and then you gotta wait for it to dry so i'm gonna wait a couple minutes for this to dry and i will be right back okay so my shirt is um completely dry now um yeah it's completely dry now um so now i'm gonna take my image and like i said i'm not gonna cut it or anything because it's just a big piece of paper here i'm gonna place it on my shirt and then i'm going to cover it with some butcher paper like normal my heat press is already preheated 400 400 degrees and we're going to press this for 60 seconds so i will come back in 60 seconds all right so it has been about 60 seconds here my timer is going off i'm really hoping this works i can see the image through the paper that's always a good sign okay so it went through is definitely not as bright though i know for a fact that if i would have done this on a polyester shirt these colors would be absolutely popping and um here's the shirt and the colors are there it looks it looks pretty good okay it doesn't look bad for this to be a cotton shirt it does not look bad but i know if this was on a polyester shirt 100 polyester these colors would be absolutely like shining bright like a diamond but it's not bad it's not terrible it has a little bit of a vintage look to it i don't know if y'all can see but it did take okay so like i said this is the shirt let me show y'all the tag again it is come on camera focus a hundred percent cotton i don't know if my camera is focusing it's a hundred percent cotton shirt this was the sublimation and i'm actually pretty impressed um and because this is like a 90s throwback shirt the fact that it looks vintage doesn't bother me it kind of goes with the theme of the shirt so yeah i'm actually really impressed like i said i will put down in the description box the um the etsy shop that i purchased this solution from um i only purchased a small bottle because i wanted to try it out but i mean if this is the results i'm gonna get then i might go ahead and purchase myself a bigger bottle um but yeah i'll put the etsy shop name down in the description box it's not gonna be a blue link for you to click on it's gonna be an etsy shop name underneath the materials that i put in the description box so yeah and i got this um fruit of the loom shirt i got it from um um i got it from walmart and it's 100 cotton for the loom shirt so but i will put all of my materials down below as i always do thank

100% cotton t-shirt. Now, this t-shirt is our standard, most\neconomical t-shirt that we offer here. It comes in a wide range of colors\nhundred-percent cotton more generous fit than a lot of the more expensive brands.\nI'd say this is our go to shirt for a lot of large events. If you're ordering for a big group go with the one hundred percent cotton. It offers so many colors, it also comes in a comparable ladies\nstyle, so you can also order a ladies style to complement the unisex. Now, more\ngenerous fit, just like I said so just, instead of telling you about it we do have our model here. He's gonna come over and you're going to see what I mean. First off,  more generous fit here, it's not going to be as tailored. There's no side seam, here a lot of the more expensive shirts. A Canvas, Next Level,  American Apparel, Alternative and so on They have a side seam here, which basically is going to be more tailored, more contoured fitting. This is going to be more generous. Also, it is a hundred percent cotton so it's not gonna have kinda that pull to it. It's gonna be more contracting. Which, you don't have to worry about shrinkage and is pretty true to size but, just with that over the\ncourse of a lot of washes, there's a chance it could shrink if you dry it on high So, with that being said this is more of\na one time use shirt or, you know, a few uses. It's not gonna be one that's gonna be your favorite for years to come. In terms of the fit here the sleeve, more generous cut. I wouldn't say it's tapered by any means it is going\nto be a little baggier. Standard length right here it goes kinda down the bicep. In terms of the neckline here, very standard collar, it's gonna be right up on the neckline. The pull of it, it's always gonna come back, it's not going to be very stretchy. It's pretty much just the\nstandard cotton. If you want to step up, we really recommend maybe the Next Level hundred percent ring-spun, the Canvas one hundred percent ring-spun or even the American Apparel those are great kind of step ups. But this shirt right here amazing bang for your buck and nobody's\ngonna complain because they get a great shirt. It's just the soft factor is not all gonna be there. So, you look great in this, Tyler. Thank\nyou so much. On the Coed Monkey Soft Scale we rate this t-shirt a one. Thanks for watching this video. Please let us know if you have any questions because here at Coed Monkey, Soft Matters and so do our customers.", "I_hvJVGMwkU": "What's up everybody, this is M at RushOrderTees along with Dan the man behind the cam. One question we get all the time is what t-shirt should I get? That's a tough one. This is understandable because there are literally hundreds of styles out there. Maybe thousands. I don't know can somebody check that? [beep] We're gonna help you decide by subjecting some t-shirts to a series of tests. It's science. So the fabric type of a t-shirt is its most important quality. So that's what we'll be testing Luckily, we can break these fabric types into four main categories and that's what we have right here. 100% cotton. 100% polyester. We've got the 50/50 cotton poly blend and we have a tri blend which is cotton polyester and rayon. Dan, and I will be ranking the shirts for each test and giving the best one a score of four and the worst one a score of one At the end will add up all the points and let you know the overall winner It's the t-shirt test [music] [swoosh] But first let's take a closer look at these test tees. Wait, that doesn't sound.... can we edit? [beep] But first let's take a look at the t-shirts we'll be testing. All right, I'm here with Dan and our first test is all about the feels. It's the feel test. [swoosh] Now what we mean by feel is the softness, the touch, the texture. This is often called the hand. Because you feel it with your hand. So we're gonna test these shirts by feeling them. You ready? [kazoo music] All right, so after some rigorous scientific investigation, we've come to a conclusion on the feel of these shirts. What did you think Dan? Um, I was just drawn with the tri-blend for some reason, you know, it was really soft. Stretchy. Very, very soft. Definitely the softest. Yeah, so I think the try blend is the clear number one. Lightweight, alright. So that's number one, I would agree with that. Number two is a bigger conversation. It's really a hard choice, but I almost think I want to say cotton. I would say cotton. 100%. Alright, so there's our number two. I think, I think poly number three. Alright we'll give poly number three. Alright so that means 50/50 is the last one. it's gonna finish in fourth place. Get outta here! The results are in for the feel test and we have tri-blend in first place taking a lead with it's super softness. followed close by cotton in second then polyester in third and 50/50 bringing up the rear. Okay for the next test we're calling it the wear test [swoosh] And for this test, we're gonna have Dan wear the shirts. Oh, really? Yeah. Alright, let's do it. [clap] Whoa! That was fast. Okay, so this is a 100% cotton. 100% cotton. Feels pretty good. Feels like a standard shirt, nice fit. Not too heavy. Next up will be a 100% polyester. Are you ready? Yup. All right. Let's do it. [clap] Wha--how are you...? It's just....we wanna move this video along you know what I mean? Okay, so polyester... Feels very light, very airy. I can definitely tell that. Next up we have the 50/50. You ready? What are you gonna do to me this time? [clap] What the? This is backwards. Sorry about that. [clap] Ah, okay. There we go. So this is the 50/50. Honestly feels a lot like the cotton. It feels really good. I can't tell if it's lighter or not. It might be a little bit more breathable, it feels like. You like the cotton better? Yeah, honestly, this might be my favorite one so far. Okay, favorite one so far. There you have it. You ready for the next one? I mean do I--? [clap] Whoa! Wow, okay, this one feels great. Really soft. Kind of like the best of what everyone else has had to offer. It's soft enough, it's very light. So what do you think? Hm, okay, so In terms of comfortability,  I'm think going to go with tri blend number one. 50/50, number two. Cotton, number three. And polyester last. But again, that's just my opinion Some people like poly, some people like cotton more. Well, science is all about opinions, so... You're right. That's very true. So here's our scores for the wear test It's tri-blend Once again in first place with its ultra comfortable wearability. Followed by 50/50 in second place. 100% cotton in third and polyester last because Dan said so. Next up We're gonna be stretching these shirts for the stretch test So we're testing the stretchiness of the fabric. And more importantly how it holds up after being stretched it's the way the fabric behaves when we stretch it Looks good stretchy. Let's stretch it up Here's your results for the stretch test Polyester getting the win on this one with its ability to snap back into shape, followed close by try blend in second then 50/50 and third and 100% cotton with a big loss here For the next test we're getting wet It's the wet test Actually, the shirts are getting wet We're gonna time how long it takes for each of these shirts to dry off in the hot Pennsylvania sun Polyester tends to be moisture wicking. So we're gonna see how that does. I have a feeling cotton is gonna lose this one, but we'll see. Let's do it Results of the wet test are in we have polyester in first place again with an easy win followed by tri-blend in second and a surprising third-place finish for cotton and 50/50 with the agony of a wet defeat. Okay, next up. We're gonna see how wrinkle-resistant these shirts are It's the wrinkle test We're both gonna take two shirts, put them on our chair, and sit on them for the rest of the day What? So we're gonna take each shirt and we're gonna ball it up and shove it in a sandwich bag and leave it for 20 minutes And see how it comes out after that 20 minutes later All right, so we got the shirts out of the bag and and they're pretty wrinkly except for this one. clear winner is poly. It was barely even wrinkled. The next one number two would be the Tri-blend here, not too bad at all, I bet these would come out as you wore it for a couple hours 50/50, Hmm Didn't do too well. Pretty wrinkly. pretty wrinkly gonna need an iron for that sucker and then cotton, oh the most wrinkly So that's a clear Clear 1 2 3 4 on this one. Looks like a topographical map. Here's the scores for the fifth and final test of this video It's polyester with another big win. This stuff just doesn't wrinkle it's kind of weird Coming in second once again is tri-blend with 50/50 coming in third and Cotton suffering a humiliating set of wrinkles. That brings us to the halfway point of this competition Let's look at our scoreboard and check the results so far Tri-blend is in the win column with a total of 17 points followed closely by polyester in a surprise second place with 15 points Cotton and 50/50 are tied with nine points apiece, and we'll have a lot of catching up to do in In our part 2 video of the T-shirt Test We will present the final five tests The screen-printing test the DTG test the mess test the wash test and the dangerous damage test, look for that coming soon Click on the items below to get more information about them or start designing on them right now Thanks for watching.

for those of you who are watching for the first time welcome and i hope you stick around so today we are going to be sublimating a black shirt and it's also 100 cotton okay so we know that for sublimation you need 100 polyester and you also need a light colored shirt okay so when people say that you're sublimating on black shirts or cotton shirts it's not 100 percent accurate okay so what you are actually doing is sublimating onto something else or another product and then you're literally pressing the shirt so today what we're going to be doing is we are going to sublimate onto this paper now this just looks like regular vinyl but it is actually easy subli vinyl that is made by caesar and we are going to actually print onto this paper and then we are going to press it onto the shirt okay let's get started all right y'all so now we're in illustrator and i've already designed the image that i want to place on the shirt um i simply found this apple online by doing a regular search for a an apple a teacher apple png file and it came up it was free and i simply just input um the pattern that i wanted to use inside of each letter okay so we're going to get ready to print and let's go look at our settings it looks like this is a little off there we go all right so you always just want to make sure that your print settings are accurate or onto the correct paper and this comes just with testing honestly because everybody's printer is a little bit different we're all printing from different computers different models so you do have to do a little testing um to make sure that you get the right settings for your needs i just want to go into the print settings and i'm printing on premium presentation matte and remember we are printing directly onto the easy subway paper okay and we have it's going to print high quality i am using borderless printing because my image is a little bit large and i don't want any of it to cut off and what's also important is that when you are printing directly onto the easy subli vinyl you cannot mirror your image so usually with sublimation we're always image we're all always mirroring our images but when you're printing directly onto the easy sublet paper you do not want to mirror your image and i am going to look at my color options and it's perfect so this is exactly what i want to happen okay so we are going to get ready to print are y'all so now that we are about to print our image we need to make sure that we are inputting the easy subli into our printer the correct way okay so on the easy subway there's a side that is a little bit rough it's more matte i don't know if you guys can see it pretty well there and then when you flip it over you have a shiny side okay that shiny side is just the backing okay so if you print anything on the shiny side it will not be able to go onto the shirt you have to print it on the matte side okay this side with the matte finish and you will be able to feel the difference so don't um worry okay and you can also see the shiny side has a glare so we're going to print it on this side once we print it um we are going to weed it and then we will well we're not weeding we're cutting if we were printing it on our or if we were cutting it with the print then cut setting on a cricut machine or another vinyl cutter then you'll read it but we are actually going to cut around our image okay so remember make sure that you're printing on to the matte side all right guys so we all right so we are going to just get any lint off of our shirt and we will be pressing the shirt just to loosen it up a bit to get out any moisture for about five seconds all right guys so the image is printed onto the easy subway and it is still wet so what you want to make sure that you do is just stick it let it dry or stick it under your heat press and let that heat just get onto the image for about three to four minutes two to five minutes and then you will be able to cut it out and place it onto your shirt okay so i let it bake a little bit and we are now ready to cut it out um sometimes if you do the print then cut setting you just put this in your cricut and it will cut it um but we did it this way today so i'm just going to cut it out and i love doing um teacher shirts for myself because my kids love when i wear them and when they have like positive sayings or if i say something about them they love to um see my shirts and read them and i also made it a little bit easier for me because i made the letters touch like i made everything touch so it's a little bit easier for me so it's going to be one piece so i don't have to worry about like placing it correctly or it being uneven that's kind of why i did it that way or that is why and i see some lines in my print but it's okay i'm just gonna cut this and then i will see you at the heat press so we're all done with cutting out our image and i tried to cut out as much of the white from around the image as possible because i didn't want any of the white to really show once we press it okay so on the back side remember that shiny side that i showed you before we are going to just peel that backing away okay and so i just want to try to snatch it off and just be careful it's a little delicate you want to peel you want to be a little careful you'll feel it's pretty tough but you just want to make sure that you do not rip the vinyl okay so we've removed all of the backing from our image and so we are just going to place the image onto the shirt [Music] and just like with any other image you want to make sure that you are leaving enough space at the top and it's pretty standard to have your image start at the three inch mark from the neckline okay so we are going to just measure i usually take out my measuring tape just to make sure and that's kind of low so we can bring it up a little bit so it looks like that leaf is right there at the three inch mark okay and let's make sure the sides are a little bit we'll move it over just a tad all right guys so we are going to press this onto our shirt for 15 seconds our heat press is at 315 degrees all right so you can make sure that you put your butcher paper down because you don't want this ink to go onto the top plate all right you can just peel a little bit and look how nice remember we started out it was dull um and now look how bright that apple is that's why i did the apple in a different shade of red like a little more brighter so that you can see the difference but look how nice and bright that apple is so we're all done with sublimating onto the easy sublease and then pressing it onto our shirt it looks really nice and what i like about the easy subway is that it's very light so once you peel it away from that backing it's very light you don't feel it's not as bulky as um regular heat transfer vinyl sometimes and it pretty much almost blends in with of course it's not sublimation because it's not sublimated into the shirt but when you feel it it it there's a nice feel to it okay so remember this is another way for those of you who may not want to do the glitter um backing for your heat transfer onto black shirts or dark colored shirts and or cotton shirts easy suddenly is an option for you okay so i hope you all have enjoyed this tutorial i will have the information below uh where i got the easy subleaf from and yeah definitely i would go with this method um again and again so thank you so much for watching um if you enjoyed this video you learned something new or you were inspired to try sublimating onto easy subling please be sure to like the video and also subscribe to my channel where i will continue to post crafting videos using either the cricut or sublimation thank you so much for watching [Music]", "ZgOX2AjzYZs": "what's going on guys in this video I'm gonna tell you the best cheapest and easiest way to make t-shirts and that sublimation printing on cotton let's not waste any time and get right into it so the first thing you guys will use an epson double you have 7710 printer this printer can easily be converted to a sublimation printer you guys will need the sublimation ink cartridges and sublimation ink and you guys don't need sublimation paper make sure you guys install the sublimation ink cartridges this is not gonna work on regular ink we're gonna go on a website called gypsy shirts and by our 100% cotton t-shirts here you'll need sublimation spray this is basically liquid polyester you can get these cheap on etsy so the first thing to do is mirror image with image image rotation click horizontally and they're gonna print image so the good thing about this printer is that it can fit 11 by 17 paper this is a large paper and is the perfect size to make t-shirts so when the sublimation paper is printed on the colors are not gonna be bright don't worry about this when this transfer onto the shirt is only perfect so the first thing we're gonna do is preheat the shirt after that's done we're gonna spray the show with the sublimation spray I'm gonna let it dry for around 20 minutes make sure you guys spray the entire area where the image is and if you transfer also don't worry about spraying outside of that area anything that sprayed outside is now going to be visible when the shirt is done next one alignment to the t-shirt to make sure it's straight you guys can tape it if you want just make sure the tape is not go on the heat press we're gonna place the image onto the heat press we wanna put the silicone paper on the heat press and we're gonna press it at 350 degrees for no less than one a minute also make sure you guys add a decent amount of pressure will present with sublimation you guys have to press it for at least a minute because if you don't the full image is not going to be transferred and it's going to look Peyton if you want a bright vivid image you have to press for at least a minute now we're gonna move the silicon paper remove the sublimation paper and our shirt is finished take a look at how bright and perfect and vivid the shirt came out so because the shirt is seldom mated the colors will never wash out so this shirt costs around $1 80 cents to make if you guys want to slow show it's online in my opinion this is the best way to do it you guys can easily sell these for over $10 also make sure you guys have Ward the Amazon sublimation sprays these are complete garbage the image quality is gonna be horrible and also this fray when it's dried out is gonna make the image surface hard so definitely make sure you guys award these another thing you guys should avoid is these sublimation powders the whole process is super messy and the end result is garbage also it's a hustle because even though the powder is cheap you guys cannot sublimate on regular sublimation paper you will have to buy special silicone paper otherwise it's not gonna work and these silicone papers for 11 by 17 they cost around $4 per sheet so again if you guys want high-quality results use the Etsy sublimation sprays and you're good to go I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did please hit the like

in this video I'm going to be reviewing Yoona clothes two people cotton t-shirts stay tuned so you know clothes - pima cotton t-shirts have a bit of reputation in the menswear community in fact any discussion around you know the best t-shirts for men is sure to include this highly regarded tee and some men swear by them while others just don't really understand the hype I bought four pairs of Yoona clothes supima cotton tees and so you know you kind of know where I stand in that camp but we got grey we got heather gray white and navy even with all the high praise nothing is perfect and so let's dive right in with this Uniqlo supima cotton tea review in this review i'm going to cover the t-shirts of style and fit shirt quality comfort and durability how well they've held up over several years of wear you know the pros and cons and as always if you want a deeper dive head on over to gentlemen within i'm gonna link that down below and then you can read more about it cuz it just showed I own four unit clothes - pima cotton tees for reference I've had the white and navy shirt for around four years now and the two grey shirts for about two years so exactly what is pima cotton well it's a type of cotton that's actually grown and sourced in the United States it represents less than 1% of cotton grown in the world and it's a unique sort of cotton due to the extra long fibers that contribute to its premium properties of strength softness and color retention the facts pima cotton is lighter and 45% stronger than regular cotton and it provides superior comfort durability and softness for the shirts style you know clothes pima tees are as clean and minimal as a shirt it's going to get it has zero branding no logos on it except for on the back tag where it's printed you know where it's made in the Uniqlo logo they come in all the basic neutrals of white gray Navy and black all in all you're going to find 14 different colorways but the wide ranging shades from olive green and yellow to red and cobalt blue there's no shortage of options to choose from here in terms of the shirts of fit you know I've said it before and I'll say it again Uniqlo the pima cotton t-shirts are some of the best of fitting t-shirts that i period they're fitted without being skin tight and have an overall clean drape the body length is spot-on hitting around mid fly and the sleeve length is also perfect landing around mid bicep the sleeves also hug my biceps just the right amount without being restricting I can't say it enough but Uniqlo supima cotton tees were actually the first t-shirt to actually fit me pretty impeccably off the rack before discovering them you know I was wearing these cheap-ass H&M tees for like $5 and the sleeves way too short and so they were always riding up and then you can see my armpit hairs and when I put them through washes the fabric just kind of got all distorted and it just did not hold up over time and so when it comes to the fit of these shirts I can't speak more highly of them some of the product details that actually comes in double x-small all the way up to triple XL and so you know there's a wide range of sizes here however they don't carry any tall sizes so if you're a really tall guy you know over six-foot some you might have some trouble with you know clothes shirts which is you know something I encountered when I was you know doing some research on forums a lot of guys on reddit some male fashion advice the taller guys were saying that the fit just you know wasn't there for the product details Uniqlo says that it's you know hundred percent supima cotton and it has a glossy Sheen with a premium feel there really is no glossy Sheen this shirt is not shiny at all however it does have a premium feel under percent supima cotton and these shirts are made in Vietnam not us which is kind of weird because supima cotton is sourced in the US so I'm not sure you know what's happening there now let's dive right in with the shirts Comfort so Uniqlo supima cotton tees are really soft and they actually get softer and softer after every wash it's a nice mid weight cotton and it is not see-through by any means you know comparatively it's not as thick as you know Banana Republic pima cotton t-shirts or ask it but it's thicker than brands like Express ever Lane and even the mountain bowed rigs t-shirts that I reviewed in you know my best t-shirts roundup in terms of where the shirts have been through dozens upon dozens of wears over the years I can tell you that they've held up supremely well they've gotten softer over time as I mentioned before and you know there are no holes in the shirts so that goes to show you that even a ten dollar t-shirt can withstand the test of time and get better over time and so price isn't always going to be a factor when it comes to finding quality comfort we're just gonna get right into the durability of the shirts had them for a couple of years now plenty of washes as I said before and the shirts have no holes in them they're not weirdly distorted or warped through many washes the shirts still have a clean drape and a nice fitted aesthetic I would say that the durability of these shirts are really good and they've held up really well over the years but it's not all perfect though and assurance actually do fake considerably over time especially the colored shirts and so my Navy shirt I would say more saturated colors are gonna fade over time with washes and dry cycles so the Navy is not as saturated as it was before that's going to knock it down a few rounds all in all though Uniqlo Supima cotton tees have proven to be immensely durable over the years where you can buy them you can shop online at Uniqlo comm or you can hop into one of their brick-and-mortar locations they have locations all across the US and so you know if you have one near you go in get fitted and see how the Uniqlo supima tees fit on your body all right so let's finish it up with some of the pros and cons for the pros best bang for your buck at 990 a shirt crafted with long-lasting high-quality supima cotton one of the best fitting t-shirts that I own period classic crew neck and v-necks in a myriad of colorways can conveniently shop online or in-store for the cons not the best for tall guys you know no long sizes and color shirts they're gonna fade quite a bit over time and it may be too sheer for some people it's not really thick material here if you have any brands that you feel are a better value you know leave some comments down below and let me know but yeah in the end Uniqlo supima cotton tees have a reputation for a reason with a price point of $10.00 and high-quality long-lasting product Uniqlo supima cotton tees are really hard to ignore and so it's definitely one of those staple pieces in my wardrobe by under $10 it's hardly an investment piece and so feel free to go crazy there with all the colorways and yeah it's all I got for this video if you liked it smash that thumbs up and if you're new here consider subscribing put out new videos like this weekly that's all I got for this video cheers to your style and I will catch you on the next one pigs", "wZnvVSwvDDY": "[Music] we're going to be sublimating a cotton shirt after we've sprayed it with a specific polycrylic water mixture although this method does technically work i wouldn't personally sell any shirts subbed using this process there are other less risky alternatives for you to have a sublimated design on cotton links below we'll be following the very basic directions in this comment floating around facebook i'd like to note that i'm using the clear gloss version no clue if the finish type matters for what we're doing but i'm simply following the info in the facebook comment i begin by mixing eight ounces of water with two ounces of the polycrylic in a spray bottle and shaking well next i sprayed the mixture on each of the three cotton shirts until they were soaking wet in the design area i let the shirts fully dry overnight sprayed them again the next day and let them dry a second full night i did an initial press for 15 seconds in the heat press to remove any remaining moisture and to smooth the wrinkles next i took the designs and pressed them onto each shirt as you can see the colors are very vibrant and vivid but let's see how they hold up after five washes again although this method does technically work i wouldn't personally sell any shirts subbed using this process thanks for watching and let me know in the comments what other videos you guys want to see here on the venomous design channel", "3vuQseWRksw": "hi everyone thanks for joining me I'm excited today I have partnered with a dye press and they are a company that has a product that allows you to use sublimation ink or your infusible ink on 100% cotton t-shirts yeah hundred percent cotton t-shirts we're no longer limited by the t-shirts that are available in the infusible ink line or the t-shirts that are available in the sublimation line so now we can use 100% cotton t-shirts that's what I did for this this is a 100% Gildan t-shirt just like you get at Joanns we've all had some of these and look at those results that's 100% cotton t-shirt with sublimation printing this is permanent washable dryable not going to go away this is a permanent design it's not going to crack it's not going to peel you can see if I spread it apart it's part of the fabric it's not laying on top it's not a transfer like an iron-on this is 100% cotton t-shirt with a very permanent result this is in fusible ink on a 100% just a plain old fruit of the line 100% cotton t-shirt in fusible link I used this in fusible link this one 100% cotton shirt you can't feel it this is permanent it's not going to go away you can wash it dry it again permanent I also tried it on a colored shirt now keep in mind anytime you use in fusible link or sublimation ink on a cotton t-shirt it's a translucent ink so the color of the shirt is going to show through but it still worked on this fluorescent pink shirt I got a transfer and you know of course it's colored or kind of changed color by the color of the shirt because it's a translucent ink but this is permanent so we can now use in fusible link on colored t-shirts we can use sublimation ink on colored t-shirts we can use our favorite cotton t-shirts I mean come on the possibilities are endless and I am absolutely thrilled with the results of this product this is the product that are talking about it's called Die Presse this is poly T plus it comes in a concentrated bottle like this you you mix this with water we'll go into all of that in the next part of the video but you use the concentrate you mix it with some water you put it in the spray bottle and you treat the shirt and then you can treat it just like any other iron-on or any other sublimation transfer or confusable ink transfer it does something to the fabric there's something magical in it but it does something in the fabric that allows it to take the ink so this the beauty of this is that you can't feel this it's washable it's dryable not gonna crack not gonna peel it's on there for good and why not I love it so let's get started into the video and I'm going to show you how I made each of these projects so let's take a look at the instructions here so it tells you for one ounce of poly t+ mix it with three ounces of water and that will give you 4 ounces of spray or you could take a quarter cup mix it with 3/4 cup water and that makes eight ounces of spray for this particular spray bottle they've got it right on here I need 2 ounces of the poly T plus 2 6 ounces of water and it's going to make eight ounces of spray so that's what we're going to do it goes on and has more information if you have a bigger or smaller spray bottle or you just want to mix up a little batch so one bottle of this is going to go quite a ways so the first thing it tells me is 2 ounces of poly T plus so let's put two ounces of poly T a plus in here and I have a little funnel just to make sure that I don't make a mess I haven't opened this yet so let's see I don't know if we have to open a tap here yep so we need two ounces of this got a measuring cup here two ounces of poly T plus now we're just going to put that in our spray bottle and it's telling me to add six ounces of purified water so I'm going to fill this up with six ounces there we go so that's it that's all you need I think it's pretty cool that they let you mix it themselves I watched her video and she said why should we why should you as a consumer pay to ship water when you all have water at home so they've made a concentrate which makes the product go much further and saves on shipping cost we're almost there all right we've got six ounces of water so I'm just going to go ahead and turn my spray bottle into mix shake it up and it looks like that so let's make sure we've got it primed must be a oh there's a little stopper right here you just need to turn that to the side to get some bottle to work oh we're already primed so we're good there okay so you can see I have a Gildan 100% cotton t-shirt right here this is 100% cotton now if you want a more vibrant print the more polyester that's in it the better so even if you had a 40% it's going to give you a little bit of a more vibrant result but we're going to go with 100% cotton because I want to see it actually works so I'm just gonna put a towel on my surface just to absorb some of the moisture all right and I have a design that I'm gonna put on the shirt that's this so it's about an 8 and a half by 11 size so I'm just going to use a piece of card stock just to kind of give me a guide and I'm gonna spray the corners just to give me a guide of where I need to spray and we're just going to begin spraying the shirts within that area the white a little bit harder to tell when it's wet I've got it pretty wet she suggests that you use a foam roller I don't have a foam roller but I do have my cricket brayer so I am just going to break it push that moisture down in the shirt and I can see now that blue behind there that I need to add a little bit more spray you want to get it pretty saturated but not sopping wet I'm just gonna push that down into the fabric so we're going to press it for 30 seconds at 330 degrees that's going to dry the poly t+ and it also removes any site and you'll probably see a little bit of steam coming out of the press that's the sizing and that's exactly what we wanted to do so we've got about ten seconds left and then we're going to give it a second coat of the poly T plus I'm just going to do that right on the press according to the directions it does not need to be as heavy of a coat this time so we're just going to take the poly key plus so we're gonna get to see what it looks like on a colored shirt I'm gonna take my roller and just roll it into the shirt place it with my parchment paper and again 330 degrees for 30 seconds now if you have the first version of this product you might have gotten a separate product to remove the sizing this new poly t+ apparently you don't need that it takes care of everything all with one product now this is the second shirt I've done you can see I've only used this much this jar is still full up to here so you can just imagine how many shirts I can do with one bottle of the poly T plus alright we're coming up on 30 seconds for our second press and we're going to open the press now the next step we need the press to be at 385 so I'm going to go ahead and raise the temperature to 385 and it's going to be at 70 seconds so while that is preheating I want to show you what the shirt looks like all right so that's going to heat back up to 385 so here is our shirt so it feels kind of starchy like it's a little bit stiff but the first time you wash the shirt that's going to come out but it as if you would put spray starch on something and then iron it kind of feels like that but it's totally dry and that is the poly coating that's going to make this so that we can sublimate again this is a 100 percent cotton Gildan t-shirt pick this up at Joanns nothing fancy about this whatsoever we're going to try it on a colored t-shirt but I want to show you this one which I look gun I forgot to turn the camera and this is the white Gildan 100% t-shirt that I was just working on and just look how good that transfer came out now again it feels kind of stiff but as soon as you watch this it's going to feel just like the t-shirt because it's now the ink is now in to the fibers of the fabric it's not laying on top so it's going to feel just like a t-shirt once you wash this but that's amazing there's not one ounce of polyester in here and we have a polyester or we have a sublimation shirt so really really believe in this product I'm really interested to see how this pink shirt does now the next step tells us to raise the heat to 385 and then pre-heat for five seconds we no longer need this on here because this has no moisture in it so I don't have to protect the press anymore so I'm just going to put this down back on the press just like it was and as soon as this hits 385 I'm going to replace my parchment paper and press it for five seconds at 385 again all of the instructions are clearly printed out for you so that you can be very successful they've taken the extra initiative and made sure that you have a good experience with this product it's not difficult at all and again she walks you through every step if you want even more instructions this it's included inside there is you can just if you put your camera on your phone on camera setting and just scan this it will open right up to their Facebook group which you can join which is called dye sublimation or you can scan this and it will take you to her YouTube video which again walks you through this step-by-step so that you are successful with this product it is I'm totally totally wild and amazed by the outcome I mean that that is just a plain white t-shirt there's nothing special about that so that means I could now open up sublimation to a whole wider variety of products so for our next design I am going to send a another picture to the Sawgrass printer there we go that should be printing out here in a second and we are almost up to 385 it's at 375 so we're gonna wait just a few more seconds one question that I wanted to address that I keep getting in the YouTube comments and on my other sublimation videos and getting messages on Facebook there seems to be some confusion about the sublimation ink and using a inkjet printer the magic is in the ink it's not in the printer it's in the ink so if you are using an inkjet printer you have to convert it to sublimation ink you can't just use regular inkjet printer some people are under the impression that if you use sublimation paper printed it out with an inkjet that that's what was happening and that's the magics not in the sublimation paper again I'm just using copy paper the magic is in the ink so you need an inkjet printer that can be switched out to sublimation ink if you're going to go that route this is a dedicated sublimation printer by Sawgrass this is my what I prefer to do I didn't want to convert a printer once you convert an inkjet printer you really shouldn't convert it back to ink jet so it's you know you you can't just go back and forth and switch it anytime you want unique because then you would have to clear out all that ink out of the lines so a sublimation ink comes out very dull you're not gonna want to use this for everyday printing plus it's going to be much more expensive so if you're going to use an inkjet printer keep in mind that once you switch it to sublimation ink you're not going to be switching it back and forth again and so you can't use regular inkjet and do this method that nut needs to be sublimation ink all right so we should be up to three eighty five we are we're going to press it for pre-press for five seconds there we go I am going to add my design facedown right on top again this is not a pink shirt so remember when you're doing sublimation on colored shirts it's not that it won't work but your ink is it's a clear ink so if there's not something white or light behind it it's probably not going to show up as well as if you were to put it on a white background so keep in mind that the ink is transparent so when you put it on a color the color is going to show through the color of the garment so we're pressing now for 385 for 70 seconds and again it's all in the instructions you can't go wrong with this process you make sure that you have all the information you need so that you have a great press all right so we're counting down we are at 7 seconds so that parchment paper is no longer any good again I press I printed this on regular copy paper so there you can see what's left and you can see this is just plain copy paper and again this is on a colored t-shirt so it's not going to be as vibrant but still absolutely gorgeous result a gun it's still a little stiff but once the first time we watch this then it's just going to feel like a regular cotton t-shirt here it is on white so you're always going to get a better result on a white or a light-colored t-shirt but I really wanted to put this to the test and see how it looked on a this is live like a fluorescent pink t-shirt I'm not sure how well it's coming through so it's kind of on the medium side as far as a darkness so I've prepped one more shirt with the dye press product and this time we're going to try the cricket in fusible ink I have cut the words be kind out of the infusible ink course it's weird and we're going to try that this is a hundred percent cotton Hanes t-shirt just a plain old t-shirt and we're going to try the cricket and fusible link with the dye press treated cotton t-shirt so let's see how this goes I've already done the two layers of the poly tee I'm gonna go ahead and put the words on we're going to cover it with our parchment paper three eighty five seventy seconds and let's see if cricket infusible ink also works on a cotton t-shirt I enjoy finding new ways to use this cricket and fusible ink I know some people are limited by the fact that you could only get the white or the gray t-shirts now that's not going to be a problem we can use cotton t-shirts in fusible link and get some really unique projects just keep in mind that just like the printer ink this is a translucent ink so the color of the shirt is going to show through the design just like it did on this but if you use a white cotton t-shirt you're going to get the more vibrant result so let's see how I did on a white t-shirt take off my parchment paper wow so here is the transfer after the ink has been lifted and here is your fusible ink on a white t-shirt I don't know if you can see the label but this is just a plain Fruit of the Loom 100% cotton t-shirt and look at that result so let's take a close-up look at some of the shirts that we made today I am so impressed by this product to be honest I thought it would work but I didn't think I would work this well and you really cannot tell that this is not a hundred percent polyester shirt everything is vibrant everything looks amazing and the transfer is solid so very very impressed I hope you guys enjoyed this video and you're

couple more linked for you thanks I you", "5x2HQcUZEhY": "hey everyone welcome back to well and sarah's channel today we're going to be sublimating on some dark colored shirts that consists of more than 40 cotton so we're going to see how we can make this work i got this bright spray off of etsy it claims to make your sublimation images brighter let's see so here on the left we have our 50 50 cotton and then over here we have 100 percent cotton and this is a green shirt so you know we try to sublimate it it's not going to show up but i have a special trick all right so the spray brite i did buy the more expensive stuff because it comes with a spray bottle being super lazy and not going to the dollar surplus i didn't want to mix it with my bleach i have no idea what is inside of this liquid i got this stuff in the mail it does not tell me what the ingredients are it just tells me to shake it very well shake shake shake spray it over where my image is going to be pressed and also they recommend you know squeegeeing it in to the fabric however i did not have a squeegee so i ended up using the rubbing material together method so you'll see that again it was pretty expensive so what i personally did a little pro tip once i'm done using the spray i actually pour it back into the bottle and save as much as i can obviously we're not mixing it with anything else so that's okay you know we added water and diluted it we don't want to do that but since it's just a straight chemical concoction whatever you want to call a potion um we just poured it right back in there to save every last drop i think i've done maybe five shirts total and my bottle is almost empty because you really have to saturate saturate it in order to get it to do what it needs to do so this is not how you want to spray the shirts now these are my very very first times i wanted to see you guys i wanted you guys to see me making the mistakes so you don't have to so here i am just spraying it like a mad woman it's going all over my shirt this is almost like a glue it's very adhesive so as soon as i open the bottle all i smelled was like a glue scent um so as you can see i'm spraying it all over the shirt and that means that my shirt is gonna have that dried glue texture exactly where it landed and that's not what you want like fortunately the shirt on the left i end up giving to my mother and then the shirt on the right i'm actually making for my husband so it's not a big deal but if you're looking to make money from your t-shirts your sweaters whatever you'll want to make sure that they're very nice and you don't have little mistakes like this because if you're going to upset somebody especially when they're paying 25 plus for a t-shirt you know you don't want to upset anybody or waste their money and you don't want to waste your time so learn from my mistakes learn from this video do not sprite like a mad woman get a nice spritz instead of the stream you want a nice little mist spray just where your image is going i've also after doing i think like my fourth shirt i did just a pretty block image with some lettering and i sprayed very large and the whole area was hard but really i just needed where my image was going to be sprayed and dried um so i actually would describe the texture once the glue dries i'm gonna call it glue because it's more of like a glue after it dries the texture is just like dried glue think about if you get like glue on your fingers and it hardens up that's kind of what's gonna happen to your shirts so think back in the 90s if you're old enough think back in the 90s when you were a kid and you had those sweatshirts the non-hooded sweatshirts and they had the barney image on them and barney was kind of hard it was kind of like that was like cardboard not that hard but it was very stiff the rest of your sweater was nice and comfy but right where the image was was very stiff and that's what's happening with these shirts wherever you spray it's going to harden so you want to make sure that you're only getting where your image is you don't want your shirt or sweatshirt to be harder than it needs to you want to be comfy and wearable so here i am spreading in the glue concoction potion whatever you want to call it i am spreading it in trying to make sure that it's attaching to the fibers as instructed by the bottle again don't have the squeegee like they recommend so i'm making do with what i got here you know we're kind of low budget so i am rubbing it in there i know that the image i'm going to use on the sweatshirt is a little bit longer but so i'm trying to make sure that my image is going to be placed all over this concoction i don't want to waste any more than i need to but at the same time i want to make sure that i'm covering my workspace so that way it has a chance of working so you'll see you're going to learn from my mistakes that this video is me making and wasting shirts so you don't have to i'm trying to save you money by wasting my own money but yeah and also pro tip i ended up saving the shirts anyway thank god i have a husband who deals with my craziness and whether he wore the shirt you know on the right regardless he would have taken it regardless of what it looked like and on the sweater we're able to save so i'll show you what happens once i press this and you'll see why i had to do what i had to do all right so here we go we are layering our press we are giving it our 60 seconds um so just a little fyi i did not put any butcher paper or parchment paper whatevs in between the layers of the shirt inside of the shirt because it is a dark color and because it is thick i've never had an issue with the with the ink showing on the opposite side of a sweatshirt hoodie or anything like that so we do not put anything in the middle that would be kind of like an unnecessary step all right here goes the big reveal let me uh let me stop talking for a second so you can see this baby it's cold outside and here we go so it's kind of a womp womp did it work on a sweater 50 50 material no did i think it showed better than it would have if we did not use it no no how did i save it i bleached it you know i love bleaching i love bleaching my uh sweatshirts and t-shirts so yeah i ended up taking this down in the basement just bleaching it out to save it it was hard i ended up washing it two times to try to get the adhesive out of it but yeah so that's that's how we fixed that bleached it um it did still have kind of a brown line around it to where the glue was but that's okay it's a gift to the bomb so and here we go this is our 100 cotton shirt green shirt dark color and as you can see so far not so good all right so to answer the question no it does not work on dark colors do i think this showed up better than it would have if i did not use it yeah probably i don't think we could have sublimated this on 100 cotton at all but is it vibrant and clear no no it's not so that's it guys i made some mistakes hopefully you learned from them thank you so much for watching hit that subscribe button and we'll see y'all on the next project bye guys", "r4QiAA4lk0Q": "[Music] it is finally time my friends the brand new tvs of 2021 have started to roll through the door and we're starting with a banger welcome back everyone i'm caleb dennison and i'm very excited to be unboxing the lg g1 gallery series oled now in years past the gallery series was really just the prettiest oled of the lg oled pack but with this year's g1 oled there is one major improvement we're going to talk about that a little bit later but first we got to unbox this thing see what's in the box set it up put it on its feet go through a few picture settings and then we'll get some first impressions of the picture quality now i don't want to wait one more second so let's do this just kidding one more thing before we get into this i want to know which one are you most excited about the lg g1 or the sony a90j which do you think is going to come out on top we're going to find out a little bit later in this month but tell me what you think is going to happen down in the comments also please click like and subscribe to help support the channel we're going for a million subs this year and we need your help to do it and as always there are affiliate links down in the description in case you want to support us that way thank you very much now let's do it [Music] here's everything that comes in the box and you know it's not very much really you've got ir repeaters you've got bexel batteries nothing pizza bexel and hey a new lg magic motion remote that doesn't wobble i love that we're going to take a closer look at that a little bit later and because we are i'm going to keep this manual around just in case otherwise you know what i do i just sort of toss that stuff aside and then look at this it's a wall mount bracket that's right the g1 oled just like the g10 the year before comes with the wall mount built into the box and that's because this is the preferred mounting method i mean it's really made to be mounted on your wall but don't you worry we've got some legs and screws that we can install the leg assembly is super simple we just take it slot it in like that then you want to pull off this plastic piece to expose the two screw holes underneath then you just do the same thing on the other side and here we are back of the tv shot and you can see where that wall mount would go it go right here in this indented area which gives it a truly flush mount to the wall this thing really does look amazing when it's mounted on the wall but we're going with the feet for the purposes of this video also here's where you're going to find all of your inputs curiously there are like three usb inputs that seems like a lot of usb inputs but more importantly you've got your four hdmi 2.1 inputs all four of them hdmi 2.1 maybe we'll talk a little bit more about that in the review and then there's the rest of the usual stuff you find back here also there are two decorative panels that you can put here to run cable management everything comes out the center of the bottom of the tv and then it has a nice clean look on the back all right here we are really close to turning this thing on and you know i just wanted to comment on the stand right now i don't hate the stand but it's not my favorite either this tv was clearly meant to be flesh mounted to the wall that's how it looks best i mean look at the profile of this thing it is super slim you know it's going to look amazing snugged up against your wall also i should mention that there is a gallery stand that you can purchase it's more of like a metal easel type of stand very classy kind of lifestyle look i like that one this is really for people who insist on buying this particular tv to put on an entertainment stand and look in the past i would have said if you don't want this tv for its looks just buy the c series oled but this year there is one major improvement to this tv that you can only get in the gallery series so i see a lot of people using the tabletop stand also just keep in mind that this tv's cable management system is basically to route everything right down the center bottom so even if you zip tie everything together you're still looking at a rope of cords underneath the tv with all that said it's time to turn this thing on okay so we're gonna get started here you know how this goes it's gonna take a little bit of time for it to boot up and then it'll ask us a few questions this is accompanied by a hauntingly robotic voice narrator that you ultimately do get to turn off thank goodness for that with that said we're gonna go forward here we'll give it our zip code so it understands uh programming for our local area if we need it make a couple of other quick selections in terms of privacy i definitely recommend you check this out and understand what you're giving away and what you're giving up when you decide to either turn these on or turn these off with that we go forward and ultimately we load into web os and the home screen which i knew it was going to look different but i didn't know this is how it was gonna look and i'm liking it so far i like that the cursor is gray now instead of pink and it's a little less bulbous in fact it has less of that sort of like i don't know bubbly animation that it's had in the past and i think that's a good change just below all the big block stuff at the top we've got our individual apps they look like they might be installed but they're not you're gonna have to update them as soon as you open them fortunately i didn't have to update web os in general i'm not sure if that would be the case for you your mileage may vary then below that we've got individual streaming services and what's trending on those and i imagine ultimately it'll populate with stuff that you recently watched this is the home dashboard we've seen this before it's how we get to airplay and get that set up it's how we can see all of our inputs at once go to live tv or manage iot devices but honestly i spend most of my time on the home screen so now i want to get into some picture settings and lately i've been starting with lg tvs anyway on isf expert which i've already selected here this tv is going to be in standard mode by default so you'll want to switch to this if you want to do what i've done then we'll go into advanced settings and i'll show you clarity uh this stuff is pretty much turned off but we want to get all the way down to true motion it's under user selection right now which has d blur all the way up at 10 and d judder at zero and again just to get things started off i prefer to start it with off so overall a really solid setting that you can just select and get going with i just like to turn the true motion off so i don't run the risk of getting any soap opera effect now this takes care of sdr but what about hdr next i'll start an hdr video up on youtube and go into the settings again and again we're at hdr picture mode of standard i don't want to go with standard so i'm going to cycle through these and get to cinema home is what i usually do with lg i think that's the best one right out of the bat i'm going to go into all settings so that i can dig into that picture setting just a little bit more and once we go down to advanced settings once again i really just want to make sure that we don't have any motion smoothing uh turned on and once we get down to true motion it's on cinematic movement i definitely see some over smoothing going on so i'm going to just turn this off once again now that takes care of standard hdr stuff let's move on to dolby vision all right so i've started a title that's in dolby vision and i'm going to once again go into the settings we'll just go straight to all settings to have a look at the picture mode that we're in and it's in dolby vision cinema home which i think is a really good place to start um cinema if you want something a little bit darker but i avoid vivid and standard because the color temperature is just too cool so i love that the right setting was made in the first place but what about that motion resolution let's take a look at what things look like there go into clarity get all the way down to true motion and it's grayed out can't do anything about it so that's great news i think that got put on lockdown by dolby and i think that was definitely the right move one more thing on picture settings at any point if you want to you can click the apply to all inputs and that'll spread it across hdmi one through four dolby vision sdr hdr whatever you selected for each of those you don't have to you might want to have something special for your games console but just know that's an option to kind of shorten things up for yourself when you're getting this tv set up now initial impressions on the picture quality well like i always say it's definitely an oled but that one big thing that i was teasing earlier in the video if you didn't already know it's that this tv is supposed to get almost twice as bright as prior generation oleds that's always been a criticism of oled right like how bright does it get not nearly as bright as a q led well this tv and the sony a90j definitely are closing that gap if the prior generation oleds were doing up to about 700 750 nits this guy is supposed to be able to hit 1300 nits and that's in vivid mode but we'll see what it turns out to be like when we do some calibrations i do have to say though straight out of the box purely subjective it definitely does get brighter and that's adding to the contrast that was already pretty great with true blacks that you get from oled i did notice a few things i'm a little concerned about i'm going to address those in the full review but so far my experience has been pretty great hey you made it to the end of the video congratulations and thanks as always for watching i really appreciate it everyone i actually want to know how many of you did make it to the end of this video so here's a little code leave me your favorite color down in the comments i know nobody's gonna know what you're talking about and that's kind of why i love it also like subscribe hit that notification bell and as always here's two other videos that i think you'll like you", "Byxu8t88O4k": "what's good youtube today real quick video i know i wanted to go ahead and make me a a shirt little halloween shirt or whatnot and uh i wanted to do sublimation but i wanted to do it on black cotton so but today what i'm going to try to execute is the cotton subs box uh tack down method i believe that's what it's called uh shout out to techbot customs and er thing like that i checked out his video you know i mean so it's a little different way to do the uh cotton sub so you want to see that sit back throw your seat belt and hold on to the wrap baby and we'll be right back but first go ahead and like comment subscribe for your girl yeah i'm gonna get right back with you y'all [Music] i believe that's a good little city let me turn off some light in here get it nice and bright all right that's good right yeah so check me out y'all real quick like i said um what you're gonna need for this method you need some spray adhesive got that tomorrow we came ready um i got um my image a little scary got jason um a texas chainsaw i believe freddie and uh michael over there they dangerous all right we gotta get the cotton too i ain't even prepared see i just wanted to show you all this i should have put some lotion on my knuckles while i came in here um bear with me one moment let me find my concept i just had them all right so got my cotton sub here my whole sheet make sure this ain't gonna cut because i cut don't join you know you gotta cut it say that on tremendous because you can use them yes you come all right um boom so what you want to do we're going to spray this paper right here this paper right here i'm going to spray with this right here you with me you're picking up what i'm throwing down baby but yeah i like miss y'all nothing heavy and then what you want to do i'm gonna get i got this box of uh trash under here a box is a better to have like when you're doing vinyl and something make it use a bunch of paper and carry your sheets and it's just better but anyway so over here spray over my box don't be too close to it though like miss y'all don't snap do not snap do you hear me all right all right i think i'm good all right i might hold these you don't understand the first time i did this um because i have tried it i messed up because i guess i missed it and like globs of the adhesive came out but you want to put this smooth side down now this part you got to be really patient with you because it's tacky so it's going to want to grab it so he's got to be quick with it once you get it up there you just kind of smooth that baby out you don't smoke but you just want to make sure it's flat y'all get all your creases out you got to be patient on this part trying to hurry up because i don't want this to be a long video i want to be like oh hey watch out uh you did video she got there for three thousand years i mean right now all right this isn't even this is looking more promising than i did the first time all right so once you got that smoothed on there like that got this move great yeah what they call i believe is the guillotine guillotine cutter also with his head yeah but um then you just cut your touch your image straight image boom i come down a few more times with the cotton so just to make sure i got any straggles see i got a straggler right there but if that happened i just i just cut it man no big deal you know i mean i can admit that cutting some can be it's very um fragile so it can be difficult to work with but once you get your little method going you'll be ah you need [Music] this one boom all right so i got a little bit of white up there that i need to get i don't want no white no way to that's why i like these guillotines all right oh i ain't get it it's hard to cut fabric though unless you get actual fabric scissors all a right stragglers i just chop chop chop chicken chop chappie choppy baby all right so that's what i got y'all that's the cotton sub stuck to the paper face up cotton so you need so we're going to see y'all get the heat press go ahead and get my little middle line going and what nizzle this uh technique with the cotton subs you know what i mean the only thing is we just gotta find a better way to to cut the cotton subs without it um fraying yeah you know what i mean other than that i still love the product still going to support tech but i like what they doing over there love let's see my foot was growing yeti all right so get my ruler y'all know me lay that sucker down but we got to make sure she even on that thing come over this way actually look good to me y'all i said we pressing and see how it goes i'm gonna press um i'm gonna do my heat press not even ready this heat press take forever to heat up audio smear all right give me a minute i will be about to get a phone because i'm gonna press this because it's it's a dark image i'm gonna press it at 460 seconds for lighter garments i like to go a little less time than that i've learned but we'll be back once all the heat presses that you want to come out and play or whatnot i'll be right back all right y'all it's close enough we had 395 which is fine we're gonna go for 60 seconds see how this dude gear did [Music] but hold up wait you don't think i might i want to go ahead maybe some socks to match it man at least to go away to keep up with the thing i'm gonna do that too all right here we go one thing i do love about this heat press is it opens up like effortlessly alright mom with the truth y'all mmm okay okay okay okay now me i like to uh i'll be overkilling it so i like to do another little just frost the top of it a little bit so just make sure it's on the shirt good not too long [Music] okay okay y'all can't see it it's too dark i'll tell you what let's make these socks right and then i'll show y'all i'll show you how to finish product now i did see that's what i talked about the cutting it you can be left with stuff like that i mean you can easily take a fabric marker today you know what i mean but that's the only problem i got with it other than that man it the outcome is dope it's super dope but let's make these socks real quick and then i'll show you how the shirt these my little my practice socks see i i got a little little plug on the low little socks the practice jumps you

used to the silky side so but y'all know it's like i love making socks if you ask me what's my favorite thing to print right now oh please believe what will say soft please believe that i like pretty songs all right i want the people that always got a song in my head it's probably annoying for some people but you know [Applause] i like his own okay all right i probably should have backed off my pressure because i got my sock jigs in there but what was this um while that's cooking i'm gonna go ahead and take my fabric marker and hit these little points right here i better than my first one

"[Music] all right guys so i'm going to walk you through a process of making a shirt the first thing that you're going to want to do or at least what i do is i turn my heat press on it needs to be to 400 degrees and this takes a little bit so while i'm printing my designs and getting things ready i just wait for that to heat up all right so i'm going to go ahead and print a design okay so we're going to hit start creating and we are going to go to the files that we have already loaded onto our computer and the design that i need right now is the halloween town and chill so we're going to select that one and it will already have your measurement set over here depending on the size of paper that you're using so then you're going to hit print and then it'll give you another screen after this to start the printing process okay so now we just wait for it to give us the next prompt to print okay so this is the screen that's going to come up next and you can adjust the size and it'll let you know if the size is too big so that's probably as big as it's going to let me do it you can also adjust your colors here if you need to sometimes i bump up the orange and the yellow all right so then we're going to hit how many copies we need this is something that i sell a lot of so i'm going to go ahead and do 10 copies of that and then we're going to hit print and our printer will start printing all right so the heat press still has about nine degrees to go um so i was going to go over the shirt with you really quick so i am going to be using a dark shirt so the design obviously is not going to show up that well but i am going to be bleaching this shirt um so as i've said before you need to make sure that the shirt that you're using is at least 65 polyester so the shirts that i typically use are the gildan soft style you can see on the tag that it is 65 polyester all right and then going over my heat press a little bit this is a newer one that i've just got so this one pulls out on the bottom and that way you can lay your shirt down lay your design down line everything up so you're not underneath here burning your hands so while we wait i'll go ahead and lay my shirt down and we can go ahead and place the design and you can either use the butcher paper or the teflon sheet right now i'm just going to be using the teflon this is just to protect the shirt from getting scorched because of the high temperature that we are using okay so we're going to lay that down it's taking about 10 minutes for the heat press to get up to 400 you can either do 55 seconds or 60. um here lately i've been doing 60 seconds i think that it just helps get all the ink onto the shirt and when you get a heat press you want to make sure that your pressure is correct the way that they recommend doing that is the paper test so you could take a piece of computer paper and put your heat press down and make sure that the piece of paper when it's like shut on there can't be pulled out so it needs to be tight enough to keep a piece of paper underneath there all right so we're just going to go ahead and press it it's still probably has two degrees to go but it's all right so we're going to push that back in there and we're going to push it down and it's going to count down while we wait okay all right so we're going to lift it up pull this out it's going to be really hot but make sure that you remove the design as soon as it's done to prevent any ink from smearing around and then here's your design okay so when you bleach the shirts you want to make sure that you're putting something in between them i have all these cardboard cutouts that i've made to put in between the shirts so the bleach doesn't bleach through you can also find these at hobby lobby for 1.99 if you don't want to make your own i typically bleach about 17 shirts at a time just because i had so many orders so yeah okay so i just take i'll probably cover my microphone so i just take this shirt and cover it or cover the piece of board with it just like so and then i'll end up taking all of them and laying them out and the bleaching process works best in full sunlight you will get your quickest process if you have sunlight onto the shirt it will take twice the time if you don't have the sunlight all right so now we're going to bleach this is the bottle that i use it is a glass bottle i will put a link to that i got it on amazon you got two of them before i started using this i was just using a mrs meyers bottle that i cleaned out and put bleach in i just use straight bleach some people will mix water but yeah it's just straight bleach and i will completely coat the design i will completely coat the design and then i just go through and splatter all around it and then once once this once this bleaches i will flip the shirt over and i will do the other side i do this because sometimes it will bleed through and it just makes it easier if you have both sides done just in case that happens now that they're all sprayed they're going to take about 15 to 20 minutes if we were in direct sunlight right now it would happen almost immediately but as you can see some of the gray ones are orange and we want them to have more of a white tint so we're going to let them sit until they turn a little bit white and then we're going to flip them over and do the other side after that we will put them into the washer using only detergent no fabric softener and then dry them and they'll be ready to go okay now that they're lightened up enough we're going to flip them over and repeat the same process on the back so [Music] so [Music] you", "SwjrwnrWUK8": "[Music] hi there frank here from shoplet well today i have for you the best cotton face masks around these masks are

cannot sublimate or do sublimation on a cotton t-shirt not until now we've got a new product to look at let's have a look at it right now those of you who do transfer printing like I do and vinyls and stuff like that onto 100% cotton t-shirts the reason why we use concierge is because they're basically half the price of sublimation t-shirts for those of you who actually are in the know now we've got a new product here where I can now sublimate or use sublimation to print onto a cotton t-shirt let's check it out Robin I've just got this test batch of a new product that's out and what they do is provide you with a special transfer paper and some special powder which you put through your sublimation printer in this case it's the year Rico print which we are using and you use the sublimation inks on the transfer paper and then you apply a powder over the top which is like a polymer powder and that then gets pressed onto a 100 percent cotton t-shirt and it's supposed to leave the sublimated image permanently fitted onto the t-shirt now I've not used this before so you're using it for the first time with me so let's give it a try I'm going to get our cotton t-shirt now it's basically for white t-shirts and light-colored t-shirts is this a product by the way it's not for dark t-shirts so let's just get a t-shirt now give it a press and then we'll see what happens right so this is the paper and I know if you can see there it's from a company called subway to cotton comm and again this is just a sample sheet here it's a little bit thicker than the normal transfer sublimation paper so what I'm going to do is to open the tray and you place this facedown in your Rico sublimation printer like that I'll turn it on first obviously and I've just pulled up a color print here of an image it's Lightning McQueen me grandson loves that I'm not going to sell this this is purely to get a good sale good the color definition is in this so I've never tried this before once it prints out the image what you have to do then is to lay the image on a tray and then you sprinkle this polymer powder over the top of it which again I've only got a little sort of bagful here so we plan to do that and cover the ink up that as it comes out of the printer it's obviously still wet and sprinkle that over until all the inks come and then we can actually press the air t-shirt with 100% cotton t-shirt so let's give that a go now and again all I've done is pull up a graphic here of a lightning McQueen cars and the image should come out here wet right as we can see it started to come out now so I'm going to bring the image black straight down in the tray like that and I'm just going to get this white powder now I'm just empty it onto the tray I'm not going to you gotta be careful not to smudge this as well apparently so I'm just going to put the whole lot on for the moment and I'm just going to swish it all about so again I've never done this before so you have to bear with me on this so I'm just going to sort of just try get it all over the top of the image this is all brand new to me and just make sure literally that the whole of the image is covered which I can see there that it is there you go so now we've done there I'm just going to pick the paper up carefully dust it off like that as I say there's no cutting around the shapes either so as you can see here it's just literally just drop it all off and I can see there that everything is actually covered and there's only this residue which is actually just stuck to the image itself I'll just lay that there for a second I've already pre pressed our t-shirt as you know what we always do there and as I say the temperature which I'm pressing it here is 180 degrees and I'm going to be doing that for 30 seconds now you've also got to be careful that when you put this down face down that you don't move it about so you want to be in the correct position really right from the beginning so I'm just going to place that down there like that and cover up with me cover sheet as you can see there now don't forget this is a hundred percent cotton t-shirt which normally you cannot sublimate - so let's just press that down there and we're going to be counting down for 30 seconds now so I've never used this before myself it might seem a bit of a faff but again it's a learning curve and it could be a way of producing I mean the biggest thing about sublimation t-shirts are they normally double the price of these cotton t-shirts right here we go so I'm just going to take it off like that we've had it under for 30 seconds I don't know what it's going to do what it's going to look like and I'm just going to pull this straight off and this is a set view is 100% cotton t-shirt using sublimation inks now look at that first of all I'm going to say to you but then colors are absolutely fantastic look at this look how about that can you see how vivid that is and there's no seams or anything whatsoever there now that looks really nice I'm very surprised by that and look at the depth of the colors as well I'm sure you can see there and as I say this isn't a transfer this is sublimation ink on our Gildan t-shirts which as you can probably see on the sign they're 100% cotton using sublimation inks how about that well all I can say is really that that's erm that's really surprised me I'm a little bit taken aback by that to be honest with you I've never used this before I've heard of the product as I say but this is in the UK at the moment I don't know if you've got it in any of the other countries at the moment I think this the price of these as compared to the normal sublimation or transfer papers I think it's about double the price at the moment but apparently the manufacturers are trying to work to get the price down so it can compete favorably with the the transfer paper market and also you know you'll be saving because these t-shirts are literally dirt cheap as well so I'm think you'll find there's no you can fill a surface there obviously but it's like a polymer surface which you get with any sort of printed surface but that ink is been taken by the polymer power that which is obviously sunk into the actual world garment as well so that's why it's actually part of the garment as well there so well there you go that's a new one on me and if you probably see I'm trying to stretch it there look can you see it's actually stretching because it's actually part of the garment as well there we go look there's no sign of any sort of degradation when you stretch it and well please wait I think I turned that lovely and look at the vivid colors as I've said before well that's just something to looking out for and that is from a company called sublet ooh cotton limited a brand new product here in the UK although I have heard of it before maybe in different guises and it is a polymer powder to be used on top of your sublimation ink with your sublimation printer so that you can actually print on 100% cotton t-shirts there you go I hope that was of some interest to you it will be to me because I'll be running it through to watch many many times and we'll update you obviously somewhere further down the line in a different video there you go hope you enjoyed this one thanks very much for watching don't forget to subscribe to my channel share my videos and we'll see you again in the next video till then bye for now you you", "caUlh9mGySo": "[Music] hi guys its Cristo welcome back to my channel today we're going to be sublimating on 5050 so poly-cotton blend as well as a hundred percent cotton yes you heard me correctly a hundred percent cotton I've got a onesie and we'll talk about shirt that we're gonna do a hundred percent cotton on we're in a short with the 50/50 now I don't know if you guys have heard of this or not but there is a company that is called dye press now what they have invented this has been out for a little bit I've been watching some videos on it and I finally reached out to them a while back and asked if they could send me some of these to try out on the channel and they totally agree right away they had them in them in the mouth so we're going to be not only trying today's going to be cotton but not only are we gonna be doing cotton shirts or cotton material we're going to be doing poly gloss so this is going to be four glass metal marble stone ceramic glass acrylic white board and wood so we could get those Dollar Tree cups and coat it with this stuff and be able to use those in our press instead of have an order and then also they carry poly natural this is for coating wooden stone so you can get some of those nice wood you know to make some coasters and stuff coat those and be able to sublimate on those as well so any type of cutting boards so no longer having to special order anything you could run down to Walmart and grab some cups or shirts or whatever it may be and do this okay so let's start with today doing the cotton this is gonna work if you're working on white grey or colored shirts that is oatmeal she has created videos on this so I'll have those linked down below there's three different videos so you can check those out so you can learn what the Desai's are all about and all that I'm not gonna get into it just to save a little bit of time but if you have a white shirt a grey shirt or an oatmeal you're gonna want to put decider all the colors you're not gonna have to worry about this alright so first step on those will be the decider and then the next step is going to be the poly teeth this is what's gonna give us that coating like the polyester type coating and that's what's gonna make us be able to sublimate on a hundred percent cotton is we're gonna go in and I'm going to show you how to mix it up and everything walk through spraying it and we're going to press it today we're going to press it with the cricket easy press you can do the same thing with or heat press she sent me two bottles that are already just like this these are 8 ounce bottles because you want to mix 7 ounce water to each ounce of these so you need 7 ounce water 1 ounce this dirty has them so this bottle right here is the Desai's or hopefully you guys can see these so we're going to mix our the sizer in here and then the poly tea and the other one so let's get started so we need 7 ounces of water and you need to use purified water so I just I'm using bottled water from Walmart ok so I've got my bottled water and I'm gonna fill up my cup here so I've got a little measuring cup to 7 ounces all right there we go but it use a funnel these funnels come in like three in a pack I think it Walmart $4 where I got these long time ago so I'm going to pour my water in here alright just like so and I'm going to go ahead and Robert a date and pour the water in the other one do what we need to do now is I've got these little measuring cups even sent me the measuring cups into everything so I'm going to take some of the Desai's are here I'm gonna kind of mix it around just a little bit I don't think I need to but doing it anyway we need one ounce of each one so I'm gonna find where my once's are on here yeah seal on top so get that off and pour this in very carefully pour that over here all right and then what we need to do is put our lid on here and shake it up now she showed on her channel just kind of going like this a little bit and not just vigorously shaking it so that's what I'm gonna do just do this a few times and we need one else same thing we want to get this in here and then same thing she just kind of showed knocking it she just kind of showed going like this back and forth she didn't show lime vigorously shaking it so I'm just gonna kind of do what she did and if you guys notice this you guys probably noticed this right off the bat I put them in the wrong container because that's what I do so what I'm gonna do right away is I'm going to I was gonna fill that off but that's not gonna work I'm gonna have to mark them out I'm gonna have to just kind of you know scribble this I'll get some vinyl and vinyl this later you know me it's gonna be vinyl so I'm gonna go ahead and put poly T on it and then do the same thing because I already know I'm fixing me messing that up alright and then I'm gonna put D sizer there we go and all like I said I'll just put vinyl on them later but try not to do what I just did but just wanted to show that really quickly because you don't want to do these backwards obviously okay so let's go ahead and get started we've got my shirt ready to go and so I'm doing white so we need to use the B sizer so I'm gonna take a piece of cardboard I'm gonna protect my Cricut make her back there by the way so this cardboard is actually just from by those inserts that come in our chocolate or packages so I just been saving them for stuff like this okay so what we need to do is you need to spray around the area that you're going to be sublimating because obviously that's what we need to take care of right and in the meantime I'm gonna go ahead and get our keys II press ready to go I'm gonna move my design out of the way we need to get our easy press to three eighty five so I'm going to push the temperature there and go all the way up to three eighty five now this first press is not going to be timed we're just doing steam so I'm gonna have that ready to go so the first thing we need to do is the decider so making sure I got the right one so what we need to do is you want to spray about where you're sublimating so go bigger than the area hopefully you guys can see all this I may have to zoom out so you want to go ahead and spray within the area where you're going to be sublimating or obviously it defeats the purpose so I'm going to spray a big enough area is what I'm just gonna do to make sure soda size there so I'm just going to make sure so you want to make sure you're coating everything very well and then she showed just kind of patting it down to kind of get that moisture in there so just want to get it nice and wet obviously I don't think she got a drench so we're just making sure that everything is getting cutted because when you look at it in person you can kind of see what's wet and what's not wet so I'm just kind of pushing that in okay and I think I'm going to go over it one more time I'm gonna press that in there so now I'm just kind of going and patting that down a little bit just making sure everything seems pretty nice too wet all right so what we need to do in our easy press is almost there I'm gonna go and get my shirt off of this and kind of rub it as well and I think she only really showed that with the poly tube I'm doing anyway but it kind of helps get that you know even on there so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna spread this out now for this next step what you need to do is you need to take she said a piece of cotton but it has to be washed already it has to be used because if not it's got decider in it because it's no so you're just putting right on top so I'm using my husband's old white t-shirt ignore it because it looks really old and dingy so you can use a hand towel whatever it may be but you want to use a used so now what I'm going to do is we want to give that out of there so I'm going to go ahead and press until we see steam coming out okay good so once you see that steam coming out you can lift that up and move this out of the way go ahead and I'm gonna do it one more time just because sure that I'm coating the whole area where my stuff's going so I'm just going in the area where I haven't done yet so just over here on the side now if yours completely covered that area you would not need to do this again so I'm just kind of waiting for that steam to come a little bit just being super safe alright so now for the next step is we're gonna need our cardboard back Harper back in here and this time we're doing 385 for 70 seconds 385 for 70 seconds so before I forget I'm gonna change my deal over here to 70 seconds now what we need to do is spray our area and I'm gonna measure down three just make sure okay we're gonna spray our area where our image is gonna go once again so we're gonna take that poly tea this time so we're taking the poly tea and we're going to spray and coat where our image is going so we're going all the way around she shows kind of you can use your image to poop it over and spray around to get like a an area but I pretty much know I'm going to be right in here so that's just what I'm doing so I'm just making sure everything is getting nice and coated alright so that looks good to me in half like I showed a while ago and we're gonna go ahead and rub these rub this down to get that fully coated once we have it ready to go we're going to want to air dry this or you can dry it with your blow dryer or your heat press or your ez press the way that you're gonna want to do this is to get this dry a little bit I'm gonna go over just hovering over it with my iron so I'm just kind of hovering just to kind of help dry it a little bit I don't have it on there now you wouldn't want to sit here and do these one after another like that I wouldn't want to what I would do is I would a head of time Desai's my shirts and then I would come back spray em with the poly coke that way they're all ready to sublimate and then you're ready to go that way you're not back and forth back and forth with each one so now what we're gonna do is I'm going to put my image down where I want it and I'm gonna actually to kind of avoid these harsh lines I've showed you before is to kind of tear it like this I'm bringing it down so I can see where I'm putting my image all right so what I'm gonna do is come down three I know where I'm going here and you know me I can eyeball where I'm at all right so say I'm happy with where that's at she shows that you need to coat it with two pieces of parchment paper this time so we're doing 385 for 70 seconds so we're gonna go ahead and get this down remember you want to stay completely still when it comes to sublimation so I'm just going to give it some firm pressure and hit go you all right there we have it so now I need to carefully pick this up so we don't get our ghosting and there you have it so you can hear that kind of stick just a little bit and now you can see how vibrant that is now I've sublimated already before on 5050 so it's nothing new but you can see how much more vibrant that is all right so now for our last step is you want to go over this one more time with your poly T and that's gonna give it a final top coat so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna put this back underneath here to protect everything got my cardboard back alright get my shirt up here and we're going to spray it with that poly T one more time just coating everything so you're just gonna go over with a nice little thin layer just like that that's gonna help hold that ink in you need to do is just press this for 10 seconds at 300 she said if you press it again at 385 at a high temp you're sublimating again so what we're gonna do I'm gonna change the temp to 300 so we're gonna hit temp come down to 300 all right now while the temperature was dropping and I need to change my time hold on now while the temperature was dropping what she did was hover again don't stick it directly on there I'm just hovering on top this is how she was drawing it as it was going down except for she was using heat pressing obviously but you just take your easy press and you're gonna hover over it as that heat is dropping plead this dry before this finished I'm dropping and that's totally okay so I don't have to hold it the whole time so I mean that's gonna get heavy it only took me about 10 15 seconds to relieve that dry so I didn't take no time at all so this last press all we need is one piece of parchment paper and we're going to go down for 10 seconds so we're gonna hit go so I've got it at 300 for 10 seconds all right there we have it now this shirt is completely finished so it's completely done now the only thing that I do notice with this is whenever you do this whole process here hopefully you guys can see this there it is and it says this heifer needs a vacation this is an image from Etsy I will link you down below the one thing I am noticing is it's given like a almost like a different right here and it feels like now it has almost like a like this is just hopefully you guys can hear this now it's not like a thick plastic or anything but it's got a coating you can tell it has a coating there I want to say because she does have like a whole group and like a Facebook page and I'll have it linked down below as well as to where people talk about you know how to use this stuff you know just basically kind of like one of those like a Facebook gun like a cricket group so anyways but there is one for this die press where they give tips and tricks so I'll leave it link down below but I think somebody said once you wash this that that all goes away so we're gonna find that out I'm gonna do that before I sell this because I'm gonna sell this down at my booth so I will let you know how that works out so there's that isn't it awesome how cool is that and this is about 50/50 because 50-50 doesn't usually come out this bright so I'm really excited about that now let's do some hundred percent cotton this cute little tee here this is another one of those wonder tees I got from Walmart I told you guys the other day this is a hundred percent cotton and I'm gonna show you guys this is that one donation higher percent cotton I'm gonna bring it up hopefully you guys can see the information there 100% cotton we're going to take our cardboard once again I'm gonna get our cute little shirt down and the first step that we're gonna do is cover it with the Desai's or making sure I'm grabbing the right one and we're gonna cover the area so I know about where this is going so I'm just going to go over it again and like I said she was kind of padding which is just kind of pushing the the Desai's are into the material you know how if you get something wet it kind of wants to hover on top for just a second so until it soaks just to kind of speed that up a little bit pushing right in now like I said I'm probably going excess with the Desai's er you really don't need to use this much but I'm just making sure I want to coat everything so obviously I'll get the fill about the more I play with this stuff all right I cannot wait to play with the other ones and get some dollar tree mugs okay so same thing I'm gonna fold this in half and kind of push on that just a little bit to kind of really get that in there now we need to bump our temperature back up to the 385 all right and this one we're just doing the steam and this one we're just pressing until you see that steam I think it took about 15 seconds last time I had a cleaner spot so you guys aren't having to look at that ugliness of it all right so I'm gonna press and oh I don't know why I hit the timer I didn't need to hit the timer but I hit 10 seconds so let's see if it does it in 10 seconds I guess if not we'll hit time again I guess we could kind of figure out how long it takes I'm gonna hit it again all right so about 30 seconds is what that took to get that steam out okay you bring our cardboard back in all right just like so and we need to do that 70 seconds again I'm gonna take our poly tea and we're going to coat it so we need to coat it to where whoever our image is going to be all right so once we've got that coated I'm gonna fold it in half and rub that in and I'm gonna go ahead and move this out of the way rubbing a little bit easier and better try not to stretch my shirt obviously there we have it so what I've been doing to protect my my mat I didn't mention that before is I've got down a piece of just paper is what it is this is just butcher paper I've got that down and then we're going to take our image for this one here we're gonna do like a fourth of July theme so it's gonna be America alright so we need to make sure and cover this until that's pretty much dry you really would want to do this stuff just ahead of time so you're not sitting here having to individually dry these because you can air dry them and that way they're just completely ready to go and the last step you're having to do is cover them with the Polish brain one more time all right so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna get this down just kind of making sure it's where I need it to be I didn't do this on the last one but I want to try it on this one is I want to use that die trans pro-spray that's gonna help hold this down I know it's not going to shift and you can use the tape as well but let's try it and see if it works with this product are you giving it a second all right so just making sure and going where I need to be all right so say that looks good to me now I've got that in place I also mentioned and I want to try it this time she used a piece of just regular copy paper but I'm gonna use butcher paper and then she used her two pieces of parchment paper just to protect the parchment paper so you can use them more so they don't yellow right so or get the ink coming through so we're going to hit go 70 seconds all right pull all of our paper is here and now we're going to peel this off there you have it this is a hundred percent cotton so hopefully you can see that there it is sublimating on 100% cotton how cool is that 100% cotton so let's see if I can see the ring on this one I don't really see the ring as much as I do now obviously you can see where my press was setting but I don't see it like I did on the other one so I don't know if it's because it was a blend but this is 100% cotton and I'm not having that now you can feel the difference so this is you can hear and this is t-shirt and then that I brought you over to my mic so you guys could hear a little bit better so anyways but look how cool that is 100% cotton so you can go down to Walmart and get some of these t-shirts you can go down Target wherever it may be somewhere locally grab some t-shirts and make them and so wouldn't that be awesome to be able to have on hand so I'm really excited about this stuff and I mean look at how much I have less so far from doing two t-shirts oh really don't take much if you guys can see that there's still pretty much full it's hard to tell you but I just I've used a lot of decider I think I've used too much all right now let me go ahead and quickly the last step that we have to do is protect this with one more top coat of that poly tea but I'm going to set this aside and let's go ahead and do two baby onesies really quick so these are 100% organic cotton from Walmart and we're going to be 282 different design so I'm gonna go ahead and cut these down cut them in half just really heavy and then we're gonna start on our process really quick just so we have these I want to make sure they're gonna fit because I haven't double-check those you know I've already printed these once again all these images I got from Etsy and I will have them linked down below so that's gonna fit on there very well and then same with this cute little cat one okay so let's go ahead and get going so two little onesies and I'm gonna spray them at the same time so I can be do them together get our onesies and I'm gonna get both of them up here hopefully you guys with us and both and I'm gonna spray em both at the same time okay one is the 12 months 1 2 3 to 6 months so remind me unifor and over here cow cuz we're gonna forget you I'm already gonna tell you this size our first so we're gonna go over both of those so just kind of spritzing those just making sure wherever that image is gonna go that we've got it spritzed pushing that in I'm gonna go ahead move over to the next one and it's super hot in my she shed right now because I'm waiting to get my I'm still working guys another lot of you guys have questions what's going on that I have so much it's just been crazy we saw have everything to do basically I mean just well basically I've got to go to Ikea and we're gonna do that at the end of the month and I need to put my floors in and that's pretty much it but um my I've got to get my mini split you know my air conditioner but I can't turn on my fan because it's super loud for the video and I'm dying right so anyways I'm gonna finish spritzing these really well alright am I gonna fold these in half this I'm not gonna worry about it all right we're just gonna make sure they're spritz okay so what I'm gonna do well actually I'm gonna fold them in half I'm getting them off of here so there we go so you can see how we're protecting our workspace get this down now I could use my 6 by 7 and I think that's what I'm actually gonna do I'm gonna move this guy out of the way and let's use our 6 by 7 to sublimate all right now this one's gonna be the same thing where we need the cotton t-shirt as you guys can see me and my husband went out on the boat this weekend and I got super sunburned so it's been great we're gonna be pulling out the steam what we're using for this one is the cotton t-shirts I'm going to cover up our onesie and I'm gonna go ahead and press now this one there's no time we're just pressing until that steam comes out giving it firm pressure steam coming up so now I'm gonna pull this off and this one is ready to go let this one aside and press the next one we're ready to go so I'm going to spray it again now with a poly tea so we're gonna grab these cut down our cardboard here and I'm gonna spritz both of these with that poly tea so I'm gonna go ahead and get these on here you may not be able to see them both but they're both here okay well let's go ahead and get that poly T so for the pointy once again you're just spritzing where you're working all right so same thing you're gonna want to fold them in half fold them in half and I'm gonna move them over to rub them Medwin rub it so I can make sure that's nice and even try not to shake my camera everywhere for the 12 months we are going to have the unicorn right ahead and dry this I'm just hovering it over now this one I'm not going to use the spray I'm gonna do it without and so now we're gonna go ahead and get our image down about where I want it to be so say I'm happy with that I can see it you guys I think you guys can lightly see it so I can kind of see where I'm going with this just stick it down just like that I'm gonna go ahead and do the same thing where I've got the I've got three layers here so I've got the paper but put your paper and then the parchment paper I'm gonna get these down and then I'm going to go ahead and get my iron down on here so just like this and I'm gonna hit go 70 seconds all right with this out of the way movies and pull this up there we have it super cute 100% cotton organic cotton it's that if that it's 100% organic cotton look at that on a percent cotton how awesome it's hot so I'm trying to hold it here and with a crooked easy breast um once again I don't really see that outline like I did on that first one so I must have overdid maybe the desizing or even the spritz I'm not too sure but there you have it how freaking cute is that it says whatever I do what I want in that cute with that uniform we put this on that cup a while back okay so I'm gonna set this out of the way already got it ready to go so all we're gonna do is let's dry it just a little bit um same thing once again you wouldn't have to go through this if you pre did this and let them air dry I think that's ready to go this one is going to be new to the herd with these foot with cows I know it's backwards until we press it but look how cute so what we're going to do is line this up once again I can see through it y'all may not be able to and we're going to get this down I'm gonna go ahead and do the pro-spray again alright so I'm gonna go ahead and get that about where I want it so say I'm happy with it here making sure my shirt is flat same thing I've got my butcher paper and my three pieces my three pieces no two pieces of parchment paper I'm going to be making sure I'm staying right between where I need to be and just get this down just like so and hit go first so we're gonna pick this up alright and we're gonna put these out of the way now one thing I want to mention too with this spray as well as this because it sticks down you can always test so in case I didn't get over here over here you could always test it first and take a little peek so say you see how peaking like that I can actually lay it back down and go again and I wouldn't have to worry about ghosting because it's got such a strong grip on it now I'm going to kill this off and there you have it super cute look at how cute that is new to the herd Oh cute look at those colors 100% cotton organic cotton I'm gonna show you guys really quick um organic cotton is what it says Gerbert organic cotton there you go I don't maybe a little bit blurry this one's a three to nine months but look at how cute once again on this one I can't really see the difference on here you can see where my iron was but you have a little bit of that scratch hopefully you guys can hear that bringing it over and compared to the shirt not as bad I really think I just overdid it on my first shirt but there you are I love it so cute awesome okay so for the final step all we have to do is we've got these last three here we just need to spray them one more time with that poly tea now what you want to do is you want to air dry these first because know they need to be dry and then we're gonna press them at 300 for 10 seconds so I'm gonna go and change my timer but what I would do once again if I was doing a bunch of these at once I would go ahead and let them air dry and then come back later and get them all at one time so I'm not having to hover over these or blown with a blow dryer so I'm gonna go and bring my temperature my temperature I brought my temperature down to 300 now I'm bringing my time down to 10 all right while that temperature is dropping I thought I go ahead and talk about these one more time they're you know eight ounce bottles so like you could get them bigger though you can get them in bigger bottles like this like the 16 ounces and stuff but the 8 ounce bottles you're gonna need the decider and you're gonna need the eight outs now if you're doing colored shirts don't worry about this just spray it with the poly tee and then you're ready to go with that if it's colored but if it's white gray or oatmeal color you want to push the potion put the v-slicer but think about it this way with eight ounces it takes one ounce of this for each bottle and then the water so you're gonna get eight bottles each of this stuff right here so you can see how much I've used hopefully you guys can see that I've barely used anything hopefully I'm trying to hold it cuz if I hold it sideways it's gonna go this way so let me put right here so I'm only used to right about here where my thumb is on this one I've probably excessively used that I've went to right about there but you're gonna get eight of these eight ounce because each one's gonna fill up to eight ounces you're gonna get eight of these so that's how much clothing you can do I mean quite a bit and like I said I go ahead and and do all the ones that you need but you do not need the decider so if you weren't doing the on the colored shirts you're only gonna need this one bottle which is decisive but remember I marked it out and put poly tea crystals can a vinyl that so you would only need one of these if you're gonna be doing just colored shirts so it's pretty awesome and then like I said they've got other stuff too so you can do the poly gloss which you will be seeing very soon I'm fixing to be going and I might get some Dollar Tree cups I'm gonna get some Walmart cups and I'm gonna get maybe some like the glass cutting cutting trays and stuff like that and then with the poly natural maybe I'll do some tiles and stuff - I'll get several things because like I said it is for the gloss let's say it one more time it's metal marble stone ceramic glass acrylic whiteboard and wood so I will have a bunch of these items to try with that when we do that video very very soon with the wooden stone you can do it on those awesome pieces of wood you can do it on the cutting boards stone stuff like that and so I will have some of those to work with this so I'm pretty excited now with those two so the decides are you're gonna need this stuff here it is called catalyst I'm gonna take it out just yet but there it is by press catalyst and this is when you use the poly gloss or poly satin or the poly natural okay so you add one milliliter shippable of measuring things in there she's just like really I mean was a she made it perfect for me to be able to fill it up with the little measuring cups to display bottles gonna send a huge shout-out out to die press for sending these to me to try and like I said for the quick response and the fast delivery I asked and you guys delivered quick so I really truly appreciate that and so here we go so let's finish up these shirts last things we need to do is add the poly tee one more time lightly Kellie make sure everything gets its moist with it right this again protection everybody and everything alright alright there we go alright this time I'm going to show you just using your hair dryer to speed this up it's like that you're done it's really fast move that guy out of the way and I'm going to point this out it doesn't matter what drop blow-dryer you use this one's more expensive so don't go buy this one but the point this is just what I have it's just became my craft tool I've taken it from the kids my point is if you if yours has this nozzle or if you can make by this attachment separately super cheap I highly recommend that you use this nozzle because it it directs that air perfectly so when you're using this in the craft room it doesn't blow anything anywhere and it really directs that heat so highly recommend whatever dryer you get whether it's a ten dollar dryer make sure it has one of these or if you can attach one that way you can direct this however you want to you thing I'm gonna point out really fast is that I just now noticed when you spray that final coat of poly tea and don't over spray or you're going to make that bleed okay so you're going to end up making that blade you see where you can kind of see around that so don't over spray it with that poly tea now this one you can see nothing happened because I didn't know where spray that so be careful not to over saturate and I could tell you because this was really wet so just a tip alright so we just need one piece of parsnip for these and I'm gonna just go over it for ten seconds just like that so all the shirts completely done and ready to go toss that out of my way and bring in this one here cover it up here it go alright so there we have it's completely done so once it's not ten seconds you're good to go like I said be careful not to over spritz I'm going to slip it out of the way and we've got our last one here so America what I'm gonna try to do with this is turn it this way and put my press on there this way I'm gonna you can see I didn't know I didn't know where spray on that one either so I'm gonna hit go oh gee so there you have it so you have America and actually it looks like it did use so tiny bit there on the sea so just try not to over spray on that so there's booze and then here's this one there we go super cute love it and then while we're trying here's our first one we did and you can see how obviously did not overspray on that one I did really good look how vibrant that one now this is 50/50 so if you spray on 50/50 you're gonna get even more vibrant than before so basically when you're spraying on hundred percent cotton you can see that's a little bit lighter and I know there are two different images but you can see this is 50/50 so half polyester half cotton and before if I did it without the spray this is the color tone you would have had with this so basically these kind of are now like 50/50 cotton if you if that makes sense but before you could not sublimate at all on cotton and make it stay without washing it out but this type of color tones is what would have been in this but because this was without spray look at how vibrant it was like BAM so I'm pretty excited about that so huge shout out to die press for sending this stuff to us and letting us test it out super exciting about that highly recommend that you check this stuff out maybe we can sublimate on 100% cotton and so I'm really excited we can do dish towels all kinds of stuff possibilities are endless so stay tuned we got two more trials to do with two more different type of videos for the poly gloss and they're probably natural so I hope you guys enjoyed this I hope you found it helpful if you did please hit the like button down below and subscribe and I'll see you on the next one", "ZJOcdzuwtRs": "you too yo you too

points are about 11 well I think I don't know anyway um but what I measured my piece out to be was 10 by 15 like 10 by 15 that's what I measured out to be so I'm doing it on a black shirt so I made sure I had a black background right when I printed my image um I made sure that it bled like I left for bleed area over it so that it came you know so there's no white border I'm trying to lemonade that white border for this client and I'm gonna show y'all what it looked like so boom this is already cut down to the size that I needed to be so this is cutting out so like a 10 by 12 something like that alright this is like it's a piece of cloth right no but there's a there's a rush there's a rough side and there's a smooth side so the rough side goes down right I'm gonna show y'all that but anyway this is all it is so we know they're talking girls show minute by so that's what I'm gonna do for y'all give me one second swish this camera I'm gonna show you what I'm doing alright so I'm gonna keep it real with y'all I wanted to shoot this video because I wanted to get this done so I came home and I was like try this cotton so about yo and I was like for the first time I got it we got to do this together this is what we do so some steps I have already done like I said I cut down the arm the cotton sub I cut that down cutting down my image with my paper I highly recommend a paper cutter like this straight edges every time one about it being today yeah anyway so I did that right I'm not gonna admit when I cut it you know I mean you want it to like fray a little bit on the ends but not too bad but if you just get some scissors and just snip it right those little threads that's holding on you'll be fine you know I mean that was at least my experience um so yeah I'm just left with this right she won't do instruction by instruction it says pre-press the garment I ain't you got the heat for us huh no okay so let me get the heat pressed first things first pre-press the garment well what's the temp first let's give the temperature 375 to 385 so I'm a term out of 385 get the temp I see with the press hitting that and I'll be right back we'll be right back you know after these sponsors so I said that the t-shirt giveaway was gonna be like in the middle I mean at the end of the video I didn't totally but anyway is right here the first person the first comment that can tell me my favorite NFL football team I've told them a past video there's clues in my workspace but the first person that can comment that will win the t-shirt giveaway back to your regular scheduled program needy all right so here we go y'all prepress garment which already did for five to eight seconds all right place cotton sell it with the world side down on top of the garment alright alright so you can you can't tell them on camera but you can feel it this is my smooth side this is my rough side actually the russia if you look under the light got a little shimmer to it that's a little clue right there you know me so shiny side down so this is a v-neck so i like don't like an inch from the bottom of the V right straight what I like about is that is laying down it ain't curling up on me you know I'm saying I can't work with it was down there makes you a straight little yeah so I mean there's actually looks pretty good to me yeah replacement that it is okay so yeah it laid down really good like I said rough side down or good or he sat down shiny side down you know so we gonna move to the next step we follow directions around here Edie he says mirror printer design onto sublimation tape if using a colored shirt make sure your design completely covers the cotton sub or goes a little outside the material material so no white is visible at the application if using a white shirt make sure that your design stays inside of the material to eliminate ghost Edie so I hear you play and I watched all these videos so I checked them out so basically if it's a white shirt you stay within if it's a black you got to make sure you overdo it like you know you gotta have a bleed on it so white no bleed no need no white no bleed no need black bleed so yeah Misha my word so like my bleed area could have been a look bigger so the cotton survived countless tents so I think I did I try to did like ten and a half bleed which I should've did more than that just my whiskey all right yeah my bad I had to go get a piece that I cut off because some of the black got cut off so I just taped it back up there no biggie hopefully it'd be all right but I laid my sublimation paper on top of my cotton sub so they bought the see how we do get some butcher paper so Jimmy I don't want anything too so it says press the 2375 and three 80-85 degrees with sixty seconds you need any temperature pill is fine if you use a if you're using adhesive sublimation paper delay a pill is the best boom all right so we had three eighty five we're gonna do it for sixty seconds Oh see I put your paper forward it does yeah I know me I won't be here to hold that's good oh yeah that's in there okay yeah oh let me show y'all to my Arriola I'll be right Bob all right so y'all here's my final verdict you know see how it turned out boom see that and when I tell y'all look at this it feel like nothing is on this shirt nothing stretchability Wow I'm gonna go ahead I'm on alright so first before I say anything just cut yourselves yeah I feel like that's part of this shirt you hear me Jane changer revolutionary Edie you read out your girl mouth I'm impressed by this product it's gonna

then in this video I'm gonna break down completely to show you guys how much you need to spend on a t-shirt not just a normal t-shirt a good fitting well durability shirt here in India what's up my stylish people via sham welcome back to the channel the best place for shopping hauls output inspiration shopping and styling tips for men yes you can see all black t-shirts here and in this video we are going to compare for different price points one at 99 rupees and other at 399 rupees third price point is at $7.99 and forties at $12.99 going to the first price point in the t-shirt number one this I got it from DeMott yes demet is not an appropriate place to buy a t-shirt but I got this in d-mat and if you see this very closely it is from a brand called mark and if you see this it is priced at 125 rupees but I got at 99 and the size is XL my general t-shirt size would be medium but however don't go by the sizing what's written on the label here when you go for d-mat or something like that specific stores for shopping just try it out I tried it out and it fits well even though it is exercise it fits well to me which generally a medium size should fit me I'm not XL for sure in this complete video I'm just gonna break this down into three components one is durability value and fit coming to the fit it fits incredibly well I tested the durability by watching it twice it's durable but however I have to mention one important aspect of this this is not it pitch black color here if you see they have used the die of very poor quality so that is the reason when I bought this itself it's not a good quality you will be good to go if you want to wear it once or twice or you want to layer it under your check shirt or jackets however if you want to wear it cap for a casual outing or if you want to go outside it's not of ideal quality guys when it comes to the value yes if you can see the fit it is a good value however if you consider the quality not so good I just don't want to take my decision on the rupees 99 price point just with one t-shirt so I have included the second one as well this I got it from Decathlon this is also priced at 99 and I got this in a size of medium yes even though it is medium that t-shirt XL fits like a medium size this one even its medium it fits me like a large size so but however fit is not that great but the quality is great and they use the hundred percent cotton one and the material is so soft for the price point what you are getting I feel that if you have to go for the 99 rupees and if you don't want the best fit or you can size it down this one as well I think this is the best one to go moving on to the next price point here we are entering the three 99 rupees price point and I wanted to go with a well known brand even I can get the t-shirts from different brands I just want to go with the well-known brand in the form of jockey and here I have gone with a v-neck t-shirt I dread getting the round neck for the black t-shirt but unfortunately I couldn't so I have bought the v-neck t-shirt in black color there are only subtle differences in terms of suede when it comes to the v-neck t-shirt as well as the round neck t-shirt so I have gone for this day I have the jockey t-shirts in many colorways so durability I can give 10 out of 10 when it comes to the plate it fits incredible guys for example it will make a normal guy like me to look like a well-built guy when I'm wearing these t-shirts if you have a decent build these t-shirts which you so well I feel that for the price point of 399 you are going to get the best durability as well as the best fit with this jockey t-shirt and anyone if you want to buy a t-shirt at this price point you can just blindly go for this moving on to this price point number three and we are entering the loop is $7.99 price point in this price point also I do have multiple options but however when we are entering or when we are crossing that 800 rupees price point I always feel that the fabric materials it should be differentiating with the normal hundred rupees or 350 shirt I have gone with the bamboo cotton t-shirt I've got this from a brand called Allister brat and I got this in a size of four small durability wise this brand it is a hit or miss I have the maroon color as well as the olive green t-shirt grand guarantee on the durability of this particular band but however but this material feels so good on your skin during the summer season when it comes to face these fits so good it fits just right and when it comes to value I feel for a price point of 600 or 500 desirable value but even the bamboo cotton is a little bit premium but still I don't see the value of 800 rupees for this t-shirt and if you consider the next one what you're going to see at the price point of 1300 you don't see the need of spending 800 rupees on this t-shirt moving on to the price point number four and the last price point for this video is this $12.99 yes it is a little pricey for a few of you guys to spend more than thousand rupees for a t-shirt however I assume that all the t-shirts are on the retail price and you may get these t-shirts on discount during the sale times but however I don't see much of a discount on that this t-shirt as well as the iris to Brad but sometimes you may get it on discount and I got one of the olive green t-shirts of the previous brand for 300 rupees for the price it's a best bargain but however I'm considering that I am reviewing these t-shirts on the full retail price whether they are worth it or not this is the t-shirt from Marks & Spencer in a size of medium it's a David Gandy collection and this is the premium line of t-shirts which uses the modal fabric and this fabric it feels so smooth on the skin and it fits next to your body with best fitting at your arms exposing your triceps and making your arms look big as well as fitting snug at the chest area with enough room at the waist area unlike all the t-shirts in this video the t-shirt to length is also perfect for this t-shirt however for $12.99 it is a hard sell but if you want to see the games on a longer run please the best by coming to my opinion I have actually two winners here but I have to finalize on one so I am going with this jockey t-shirt at 399 you can get a best fitting t-shirt with the best value for whatever you pay and with good durability however if you have the money if you want to spend anything more than thousand rupees on a t-shirt my simple recommendation would be go for modal fabric t-shirts like a David Gandy collection t-shirts from ox and Spencer you will not regret and you've got the answer how much you should spend on a t-shirt here in India prope 399 and you are good to go I hope you

"Ue0_AsqOEA0": "hey this is Tom with the father's workshop screen-printing and what we're gonna do we've got something in the mail that we want to check out and it's for putting sublimation on t-shirts not Polly t-shirts but gah so you don't come back right after the intro [Music] [Music] hey Tom the father's workshop screen-printing and we're here again and we're making another video and I don't know if you like him or not if you like to mother to that we made but anyways we're not real big on videos but anyways we're gonna we're gonna do something today we got some stuff from a company and we're not advertising unless you want to sanitize for you but we we got some stuff and it's it's from a company called Dai France and we we bought some stuff because we're curious about sublimation on garments now it's nice when you can put a nice graphic on garments by just using your heat press because I mean I have I have I have other graphics and stuff that you can actually heat press on to the car but this is something that we can print with our printer with the sublimation ink and be able to have a nice graphic and hopefully it would come out nice on shirt now I have heard that it really worked good now this is a little bit of a process because first of all you've got to use the the Desai's are on white and gray shirts to get the decides are out of it that they put into it it has to do with something when they when they're doing this church when they're making the shirts knitting the church or whatever it is it has something to do with with with with that process but they take the D sizer out it is it's removed when they put the ink in them so your your blue shirts and your yellow shirts and your orange green all your colored shirts don't have the D sizer and I'm so you don't have to go through this process but then once you've done that once you if you're gonna do a white shirt once you gather these sides are out of it then you have to use the the other chemical that you spray on there let it dry put in your heat present cure it spray it again cure it again and then you can put your sublimation graphic on to the garment onto the cotton garment so this is sublimation ink on cotton shirts and I have supplemented on cotton without you know without without this stuff and I know what it looks like and you got to be particular when you do it you can do it you still put that on yours on the shirt but it's it's it's it's really kind of blurry faded it comes out but it just it's not crisp but you know hey that you want say a nice clean crisp image it's not like that if you don't use this stuff I guess because I haven't used it yet and what I say haven't used it yet is is it's this stuff right here still on a package haven't even open it yet now this is the B sizer this is what you use on the white and gray shirts you put that on there and there's a process to make sure that you do that then once you've done that and you finished that process then you use what's known as this and it's the poly tea spray anyways just a bottle without a sprayer but this is a probably teach spray anyways and this is it's as concentrated so it'll make up as it's eight ounces should make up to 64 ounces I think it's seven ounces per ounce so that's the way it works what we're gonna do that so come back let's see how it does let's see how it works [Music] [Music] [Music] everything's gonna go [Music] it drops of spray on there now today we're back in this morning time and my Chinese food was great all right we have the heat press getting warmed up and we've went ahead in time to 10 seconds because we need to press this shirt now now that we wet it last night we let it dry overnight come back out here to the shop and I'm going to do now is let the heat press get hot when it gets hot we will press it I think it says for 10 seconds then I've got my he press yet for 10 seconds once it goes down and then we'll bring it back up and we'll take it back over to the platen over here and spray it again and maybe we'll go throw it out in the dryer and let it dry quicker so we can get that second coating on there and you know going to get the second Curie and then we can go ahead and see how this stuff works we're gonna print some up on our printer [Music] only say what said sure did you do yes last night I didn't do front of the back battle I'll just press both sides and I'll have to spray both sides I'm just kidding [Music] [Music] way and then we know that we've sprayed all of this so we'll take these depressed and it is set 385 degrees and we depress it for 10 seconds [Music] offensive ten-second charity thing not again anyway I went a little funk see that smoke I'm assuming that that is the D sizer not the sizer for that is the puck I seem that the smoke there is quality I don't want a bunch of spots all over my shirt [Music] that means we have to [Music] now we're gonna take the shirt we gon spray it again again now what I need to do now that I've done the two cures I've sprayed it let it dry now I'm doing then I did two cures what I'm gonna do now is we're going to put our picture sublimation ink and I did this I run this put together there on the computer there is we gonna put it on the shirt and it says to use butchers paper I'm I don't get that yeah I know I know I need to put something in between where the shirt is here so when you open up the inside of the shirt because that's what's gonna happen is it breaks into a gas so it's naturally gonna go through the material now I don't know if this poly tea is supposed to stop that but I'm gonna put something in between there anyways just to check and see maybe that's why the butchers paper for I have I have some Teflon paper I have up sheets that I put on and so we'll go that route on as far as put it over the top so anyway let's let's just go ahead and work with this thing and see what it looks like so I'm dying to see how it's gonna look now that I've got it it sure twice let me take these glasses off now I can I can see them reading glasses okay so we're gonna go ahead and put this on on the shirt put it on the shirt I think all we're gonna do we're not let me let me let me get the camera set up and we'll come back just hang on okay we're back you had to get the camera set up I hate that's over the cameras and and I'm using a cheap camera anyway so anyways what we've got here now me let me direct down here [Music] [Music] [Music] now this says this says we're supposed to [Music] get our feet press in a 385 degrees and we're supposed to press it for 70 seconds so I'll get that ready in just a second what I'm gonna do open this up [Music] [Music] I went to break into a gas it doesn't bleed through and [Music] [Music] thanks but when you got pictures like this it's kind of crooked anyways so if you put it on there little bit crooked it ain't gonna make any difference [Music] try to get a straight from cans [Music] I do what I need units I need to set this 70 seconds [Music] [Music] here we don't put it on there upside down set it up on shirt [Music] [Music] drop this all for 70 seconds [Music] I can notice temperature dropped you see that [Music] and that's gonna happen who says 70 seconds is up that seemed awfully quick only a few more seconds because the heat dropped and when it did it didn't maintain that no that's really why I set the temperatures a little higher can see it still it's 372 degrees and so it we didn't exactly press at the temperature so normally I set my temperature is higher so one actually is it cools off but it still does all right here we go [Music] when they say 385 and I'll tell you what man I normally go about 400 degrees [Music] not a real of course it could be mine my friend maybe I didn't turn it out as perfectly as I shut it that was treated [Music] treated a couple of times and like I said it's not supposed to be straight it's supposed to be crooked like that his head supposed to be straight got a nice feel to it where you can feel the regular shirt here the softness this is 10 of May today yeah that's pretty good like I said the purple see this one's got left over after after all that it could be the either idea I left it too long and the purple started to burn which is what your red and stuff will do that they'll actually start turning brown and this did turn a little brown instead of purple so maybe I'll do it again on another shirt and see what happens with that because yeah my my Reds turned a little but I mean I got the donut here but I think that dome that was supposed to be pink and it's red so I think it got too much heat for too long so seventy seconds and the thing about it is now these presses are not always accurate either something else too I wanted you to notice that remember when we put the paper in the middle and put the paper in the middle there because we worried about bleeding through [Music] you look after treating it twice it didn't even bleed through so that's good and actually that's my my purple turned brown and I think like I said because of too much heat but actually I kind of like the brown wool over there because it Ronnie coffee coffee face that's your coffee face I got the face so that's pretty neat I think what I'll do is I'll treat the back for Manila face on now put donut faizon sir that's uses sublimation ink and using a product called poly tea by company : Die Presse and next time next time what we will do we will and this is it this stuff here mixes one ounce with seven ounces of water give you eight ounces of spray and I imagine you can do a lot of stuff with that that's a lot of spray and [Music] stop father's workshop screen-printing and there it is who is what you think get the product spray on the cotton t-shirt let it dry cure it with the heat press doing it to do this repeat that over again and then put your picture on there I'm only experiment with some more I'll get them and sell em on eBay I'll experiment the ones that I experiment with you're still good-looking shirt I'll sell them on eBay so be looking father's workshop screen-printing TF w is screen printing I think it's pretty neat anyway that's that's all for this video so thank you for tuning in and yeah we had to little naughty sometimes but that's just where we are some folks say that we're handicapped from the neck up maybe they're right this is Tom the father's workshop screen-printing and thank you for tuning in and again god bless so until next time [Music] [Music]", "vhzvlywGzwc": "right hello hello hello welcome to our first YouTube livestream from sick deals I'm Johan I'm no Lisa and today we're gonna be testing out face masks so we have purchased seven reusable face masks and we have one disposable one I'm just going to compare at the end we're just gonna be looking at fit comfort style and of course Valley because we're slick deals if you have questions along the way like how does it feel is it easy to breathe fit on your head any of those questions ask us it's a live stream so we have our producers going to be relaying those questions to us we're also going to leave links to all the masks in the description of this video so if you want to buy some at the end you can do so any purchase it goes may get a commission from and we're ready to jump in anything to note before we start just a quick little disclaimer that we are not doctors at least some of us yet just kidding we're not going to be speaking to the effectiveness of preventing viruses but we are going to just give our little chime in on how does it fit and is it worth the price right alright let's jump into the first one we have is the universal face fabric mask so one for you one for me where's this one from you can buy these on Amazon they're about $24 for a 4-pack okay so good average as to what $11 per mask no no that does not go over the price of escalator here fict feels good this is not too bad this one's nice good enough space in front of your mouth I like that this one has the adjustable nose bridge for those of us who wear glasses we've had a big issue with the fogging up of the glasses which is so frustrating so the clamp here on the nose bridge really helps to keep the fog out this one is the number one bestseller on Amazon and I could see why it is it's easy to breathe some of them are very clingy to the face and this one is just you you know it's not suffocating that's a little bit of a gap here on the side but the Clampett unknowns I like so hopefully if you have glasses it doesn't seep out thing there covers your chin comfortable around the ear you can also do this put it lower on the nose bridge and then pinch it down I like it that's good not bad any questions on this one 100% cotton might be sweaty in the heat yeah cuz there's 100% kind I mean it's put together very well yeah it's good alright alright nice on that one next up adidas we've seen this on slick deals this is a universal one-size-fits-all washable before I put this one on this one's really nice because the type of fabric that they chose to use is like an athletic fabric it's very breathable and they also put a little slip in here that you can put in your own filter yeah this is good so we bought these and it's a three pack one out of three actually ripped in the seam mm-hmm pretty much on day one um day one too did not buy one did so pointing that out but yeah then wearing this pretty much consistently for several weeks now it's definitely nice comfortable as comfortable as a mask yes I will say for women this one is really nice because if you're wearing makeup you'll notice that by the time you take your mask off you're getting very like clingy and very sweaty and your makeup look super shiny this one doesn't do that and I've been using this one for the less like two weeks now that's a tag inside you can show that one there just wring that out no don't rip it out you'll want to cut it out because it's uncomfortable to keep it in there but yeah otherwise it does not have a nose bridge right so but it's sorry this one definitely fogs up your glasses and what's the price on this one 16 for it yeah you get a - yeah I'm gonna fire at four and a half on a five star rating there five dollars shipping unless you find a deal we saw this on the front page this link feels so very popular masks I think a lot of people wear this one there's damn multiple colors and they are donating right a portion of the proceeds go to the global coronavirus response say the children's global Korea s monthly yeah two dollars from every pack and they are also a machine washable put that one there we have a question okay Jessica dome wants to know if you can store snacks in the masks oh can you start snacks maybe in this one oh this one's for the pocket if you don't want to filter just put your little snacks in there yeah it could even like a Twizzlers you know just swing it around or nibble while you wear put some gum in there yeah also there any tips to prevent fogging with glasses fogging yeah so the ones the masks if you are wearing glasses it's really important that you get one with an adjustable nose bridge like these ones because oh this is nice it has like a little divot downwards because you can put it lower on your nose bridge and so it stays there yeah you want to get a closed seal mm-hmm bridge so these ones are the spoke solid they are multiple colors at Kohl's you have a lip print very appropriate okay so breathability yeah I would say this one has a little bit of space just like the first ones we tried yeah I like that it has the space here had this like straight nose bridge almost yeah that's different nose bridge than the previous one yeah the markets don't work the fabric is really light and breathable very comfortable it's not as tight on your chin I don't like when they were super tight around my chin yes well that's face mm-hmm title what I really like is these little dude Iggy's that's not the technical term for it but it's really nice because you can adjust your ear and I have a very small face for a grown adult so I I've been wearing kids masks so for this to be adjustable it's actually really nice you could just fix it here yeah this actually comfortable I really like the fabric the fabric definitely I do keep all these right yeah yeah okay that was the third heading on to the fourth you only have one of these I'll let you try that one on well you can try it after me it's it's quite unique how do you know how to put it on but this is page one a headband fabric mask we have a question for previous nice okay do the tie stick into the ears when you try it on absolutely not no no actually very cool because the do Diggy is a soft like silicone fabric material so you really can't feel it behind your ear whatsoever the other two are pretty tight around the ear and you can't adjust them these you can adjust and you know from just using the default tightness so to speak they're actually really comfortable behind the ears so yeah it's gonna you can adjust them this one is probably gonna get a ton of makeup on it if you're female because it's white I do a different project different way all right so how do I get into this one it's a good question it's also helped I'm just gonna spoil like it's a bee I'm gonna do this okay so it starts off like this and has a little thing in the back you can tighten it oh I see I'm gonna try that I can immediately tell you it's not super comfortable it looks like a giant pants leave that you just yeah repurpose your basketball I just might hiking I can see this one being nice when you're outdoors maybe into nature we got a question do you think it'd be good for a run yeah yeah I think that would be the most appropriate my question would be if you're exercising is especially running if it will stay on if it won't like fall down a lot yeah in the back like this actually it still stays on pretty tight up here does it feel secure will it stay up if you move yeah actually I think the pros because it has yeah so this one has an adjustable string so it's keeping the tension so it'll it will say yes so you can tighten as much as you want actually better maybe I just had it all wrong in the beginning this has four Ida four-four four point four out of five stars on Amazon and $17.99 each yeah so it's definitely the front of pricier side hand wash only I'll let you try to see what you think it's kind of interesting in the world of masks this is quite unique $17.99 each that's crazy what is this made out of gold doesn't tell us it's not made of gold then I don't know it's hand washing only so we have a question if you can blow a candle out the math do you think you can blow again definitely this one with this one for sure probably not with this one maybe this one yes you can blow a candle out I don't like this one at all it goes too high up in my eye area should pull it down a little bit if I pull it down my head's too small and it goes straight to my neck yeah yeah so if I wear it down there but it's still gonna leave a line of demarcation which her females were we're not okay with that we're getting a lot of requests for jumping jacks oh and the portion that will get cut off so can't accommodate without we can't accommodate on the frame next one though so yeah this one kind of interesting you know if I would yeah maybe if you have motorcycle or something maybe for running I definitely think the fabric is nice better than for exercising better than the other ones so maybe but it's kind of big also okay next tom Ben so we want reusable fabric mask you want black or blue I'm gonna go with black and this one's $13 $4 shipping five out of five stars huh so it looks like they opted to use a little another doohickey but they did a front stitch yeah I'm gonna have trademark all these words you're making up on the spot whoa this one is small so these ones come in two different sizes you have the small one you know we should probably switch there you go small for you disclaimer this is my husband's old I mean it's okay we're making sure yeah so be yeah this is really nice yeah this is nice these also this company also donates one mask for every mask purchased this is polyester and cotton adjustable nose bridge is interesting the adjustable nose bridge it looks like the kind of thing that you put around sandwich bags to cross that's why I called it a doohickey because I didn't know word what if any of you guys know the real word for what the things that we get at the grocery store that you wrap plastic bags to keep them there yeah it's like a plastic wrap pipe cleaner on us when I made my homemade one I used pipe cleaners and this is essentially the same thing they just stitched it on the outside I will say as far as fit this one fits the best so far the this one for me this was a little bit big but definitely can't blow out a candle this one we're getting a lot of requests for how these ones work with glasses well I'm not wearing my glasses today but I could see this one is not as tight I don't take it off so people can hear me later the the nose bridge doesn't seem to be as a chart it's letting off steam you're probably still gonna fog up with glasses on this one I would say four glasses for $13 dollars shipping I mean you do kind of have to take into account that it's buy one donate one so you're essentially buying two for the price of thirteen but still I don't know the nose  could be a little bit longer I think yeah in order to more reinforced in order for those people who are wearing glasses for it to work better yeah so maybe not the top choice for glasses I would I would go one of these four glasses so far out of the ones we've tried specifically because this one has this at the bottom here so this kind of absorbs more around your nose and it keeps your steam from zonals alert so the Tom didn't uses a twist tie which you can twist yeah you can change it out any time yeah twist tie that's the word okay also I see so it's made that way so you could just be cool about it out replace yeah if it gets you know broken or whatever too much usage all right Matt engine these are the the runt of the litter recycle so these are five dollars for a two pack at Target the ratings are not great to point out of five stars six dollars shipping but if you got targeting just pick them up obviously a store pickup where available so yeah let's try them on 100% cotton also machine washable also 100% see-through because these ones I actually didn't wash these so so it smells like very long laundry detergent but it's very tight but does leave a gap up here because it doesn't have a nose bridge so definitely would fog up your glasses I'd imagine definitely feels very warm to the fabric fabric it's like you're wrapping a t-shirt you're definitely gonna get sweaty if you're a female and you're wearing makeup like this one's going to me not wearing makeup you also sleep but like this this gives me claustrophobia Yeah right I need a structure in order to not feel like I'm being smothered and this is very smother compared to the the Amazon ones that we tried which is also cotton have more space yeah because they have stitch making it a curved so it doesn't cling to your face flat you see if I open the clothes someone's get the fabric in my mouth yeah so yeah I'm not a fan of that one these ones make doing a mortal combat hair oh yeah I can definitely see that all right we have one more pair of walking through these fast we have two different colors I think these are small try em hmm there I really like these ones these ones you can find at Target fabric well this is probably a common Jersey boy what am I gonna say like I think is this large yeah wait today wow I can't even fit that one so large is for very large humans large see and okay this one's even still too big for me and I have a pink one of these at home that I bought for my daughters and it's the kid size ones and the kids like the ones are ones that actually fit yeah this one is still even too big for me good tidbit there on the size and so yes this is small I think so small as more like the fits the regular you know universal sizes or a medium with the target fabric vest so small means so it's a small medium and these are large the black ones are large so if you normally were small then you probably want to go with the kid size mm-hmm 100% cotton machine washable yeah it's really nice on the price point it's a 2-pack for four dollars and it's like hair tie material on the ear bands so it doesn't hurt whatsoever it's almost invisible are they breathable which mass have been the most breathable I'm not breathable I'm still gonna go with these ones this type of fabric is it's like smooth and shiny and it just I don't know why it's so breathable yeah this is fine as a backup mask probably no we'll go through again quickly so let's try to but first let's try to compare these all to disposable masks and see like hey would you rather just do a disposable mask or pay for any of these so obviously this have nose bridges which is good you can get a 50 pack for about ten dollars and then the Oh shouldn't get some all subsequently mm-hmm this one has a gap on the side one size fits all though you can notice extend I think most of us have probably tried to suppose a little masks I'm not a fan of them yeah these ones are on the frontpage currently for 874 I mean I like these just to have them in the car in case I forget mine yeah I can just pull one out to get into a store but I wouldn't use these that's my primary ones especially not to try nice so these ones are extra sweaty too because they're essentially made out of plastic yeah let's run through quickly lowest price per mask here so we have the target fabric masks which are about $2 per we have a mad engine fabric mask for 250 roughly per and then we have the Adidas face covers which are these ones 5:33 a mask and universal fabric mask for six we have the bespoke which is kind of favorite about $6.99 per I feel like that's a very fair price yeah $6.99 I wouldn't pay more than ten dollars for a mask yeah and then Tom Ben thirty knees are kind of pricey and page1 had been the weird one obviously the most expensive at $17.99 so out of these seven which ones I think I know my favorite weight which one we talked to my top two are gonna be these ones I do like the Tom bin because it's a good cost like you're getting it for what 650 a piece because one's gonna be donated to hopefully someone who can't afford to buy a mask and the fabric and structure of this one is really good it's very similar to this one if you see like when we patterned it out it has a dip of straight and then a dip again so it doesn't cling to your nose right so yeah I would say number one number two and then even though the adidas didn't last very long I liked that one for working out in exercise activities so I'm going outside because the fabric is performance fabric so it's made to absorb sweat it's been the best one to like not mess up my face makeup - yeah I'll probably agree definitely this is the by far the most comfortable and the nose bridge is really good doesn't seem like you would you know fog up your glasses it's really comfortable on the inside I feel like some of these are good fabric on the outside maybe not so nice on the inside yeah it does not have a pocket for a filter which is interesting only the adidas ones I think had a pocket I mean I could speak to the quality of construction because I'm a seamstress but this is a really good quality like they took their time in making this pattern and you can just see like the details of the stitching they even put like a little nose bridge support here like it's great quality solid solid solid yeah which brand do you each like the best this one yeah the bespoke solid color from Kohl's that one's my favorite adidas would be my backup so yeah I should have come should have should have gotten a print I actually would wear in public now this doesn't match [Music] so yeah that's cool those were all the masks any other questions coming in people want a quick muffle test to see which one muffles your voice the most I think has to be I think that one was the most monthly because it's so tight okay muffle muffle one two three yeah this one this one feels very muchly because it's in my mouth as I'm talking this one doesn't seem to muffle whatsoever no this is a fun test no no no this one that's a little bit of muffle mm-hmm but the good kind of muffle all right I think we've done enough muffle tests all right so we have links in description for all these the ones from Kohl's are definitely the standout in terms of all-around comfort probably wouldn't give them style points but that's my fault for picking this they had multiple different patterns I love this so adidas also really good to have them in a couple of different colors so those are definitely the two to favorite on my part and you liked the Tom Ben and Tom Binns and we spoke as well yeah cool well that was fun what else should we try next time try something else try something else we're gonna be doing this maybe real face masks Oh in care face masks interest I thought this video was about by the way all right nothing else then we are good to go so thank you all for watching thanks for questions wear your masks and yeah see you next time don't let them go to the ocean though one", "JrdZY-Cxppg": "Welcome back to the Gentleman's Gazette, in\ntoday's video we're going to discuss some techniques you'll need to know in order to\neasily wash it home what some people consider to be a fairly temperamental garment, wool\nsweaters. This video is part of a series we're doing\non garment care, the first video in the series dealt with how to get that musty smell out\nof vintage clothing. You can take a look at that video here. Also, stay tuned for further parts in the\nseries that deal with some cheap and easy laundry hacks you can use and also most importantly,\nhow to get stains out of any kind of garment. The topic today then is how to take care of\nyour wool sweaters and other wool garments. First of all, wool doesn't actually need to\nbe washed very often as the lanolin oils that are present in the wool make it naturally\nanti-microbial. So as long as your wool garments are only\nsubjected to average wear and you give them a little bit of time to air out in between\nwearings, you won't actually have to put them through your washing machine or hand wash\nthem all that often. In those situations where you do think that\na wash would be best however, fight the impulse to take your wool garments to the dry cleaner. The solvents that are used in dry cleaning\nare eventually harsh on wool fibres and will break them down overtime. Why are most people so apprehensive to wash\nwool at home the, common knowledge seems to be that wool will shrink if it's exposed to\nwater, heat, detergents or other factors. Here though are two essential truths, one\nabout washing and the other about wool. Firstly, what's actually doing most of the\nwashing when you wash your clothing is having water pass over and between the fibres of\nyour clothing. The detergent that you use in your washing\nmachine is acting as a surfactant. Essentially, it is making the water more slippery\nso that it can more easily get between the fibres of your clothing. In other words, the water is doing the work\nof the washing, not the detergent. Second, here is something you actually may\nfind mind blowing about wool. It does not actually shrink in the laundering\nprocess. Rather, as the wool fibers are agitated back\nand forth and move around during washing especially during drying, they lock closer and closer\ntogether creating another material that you may also have heard of, felt. Sometimes, of course, felting wool can be\na good thing such as in the process for making traditional men's hats. But of course, you do not want your sweaters\nto end up the same way. On that note, you can check out our playlist\non men's hats located here. Furthermore, though, the majority of felting\nis not going to take place in the washing machine since water will be in between most\nof the individual fibers. Rather, where felting occurs most often is\nin the dryer as the clothes are dry, hot, and being constantly agitated. So ultimately then, the primary thing to focus\non whenever you are washing wool is just to prevent felting. This is true for either of the two techniques\nwe are about to show you. With that in mind then, hand-washing your\nwool sweaters is the safest method for cleaning them so it is the method we will go over first. To get started, add two capfuls of a gentle\ncleaning agent like wool and cashmere shampoo to a container of room temperature water. Turn the sweater you are going to wash inside\nout, submerge it in the water, and gently agitate it with your hands so that the cleaning\nagent is thoroughly worked through.Then soak the sweater for at least ten minutes and up\nto half an hour. After you've done this, you can rinse the\nsweater by running cool water through it and when the water is no longer soap, you'll know\nthat the garment is thoroughly rinsed. Before drying the rest of the way, you can\ntake some of the excess water out of the sweater by applying gentle pressure. Keep in mind that you should never wring out\na wool sweater as the excessive agitation is definitely going to distort the fibres\nand might have the potential to cause \" some felting. By the way, if you see any visible colour\nin your basin of water, don't worry. The garment has just released some of the\nexcess dye that it had put into it and you're not going to see any visible loss of colour\nin the garment when you wear it again. Since the full drying process is the same\nfor both of the washing methods we're going to show you today, We'll come back to it in\na minute. First we're going to illustrate the technique\nnecessary for how to machine wash your wool sweaters. Yes, you heard me correctly. First, turn your sweater inside out as before. Roll it up as tightly as you can, don't bunch\nit but roll it, and then put it inside of a mesh washing bag which should also be rolled\nas tightly as possible and secured with a safety pin if necessary. This preparation is done with felting in mind,\nsimply stated if the sweater is rolled up tightly, it's not going to move around and\nit's not going to come into contact with other garments' fibres or really with its own fibres\nto a certain extent. Therefore, the risk of felting is greatly\nminimized. Also we turned it inside out because if any\nfelting or pilling does happen to occur, it's only going to be visible inside of the sweater,\nnot the outside. Putting wool items into their own mesh bags\nis also beneficial for your washing machine as felt fuzz from loose wool items could clog\nup the machine's working. Therefore, having things in mesh bags is good\nfor your garments and your machine. Next, add the appropriate amount of wool and\ncashmere shampoo, depending both on the size of the machine as well as the load in question. Also, you don't have to worry about using\nthe delicate or woolen cycle on the machine or worry about spin speed. As long as you've got the wool sweater tightly\ncompacted inside the mesh bag and the bag itself is also tightened down, the express\ncycle on the machine will be just fine. And here's another about water temperature,\nthe washing machine industry standard for what's considered cold water is actually closer\nto what will be in your machine if you select the warm setting, rather than the cold water\nthat most residences can tap into. Also, truly cold water doesn't do a very good\njob of activating detergent, so using warm will be your best bet. Once the washing machine is finished, promptly\nremove your garments both from the machine and from their mesh bags to reduce creasing. Now let's cover drying, as we mentioned before,\ndon't use your dryer. Remember, that's the location where felting\nis most likely to occur. Rather what you should do is lay out your\ngarments flat on a drying rack and leave them there to dry. You can also speed up this drying process\na bit by taking an item and laying it flat on a clean towel. With the garments in its natural shape, roll\nup the towels slowly like a sleeping bag using gentle pressure to get out some of that excess\nwater. Wait a few moments, unroll the towel and then\nput the garment on the rack as normal. While your sweater is on the drying rack,\nyou can reshape or block it using gentle pressure with your hands. Once you've gotten into the shape you desire,\njust leave it on the rack and then it should dry that way. Avoid placing your garments in direct sunlight\nor near heat sources like a radiator because this could increase the risk of yellowing\nas well as shrinkage. Also, you should never hang your wool garments\nto dry them because gravity will pull on the water that's left in the garment, unevenly\nspreading out the fibres and distorting the garments overtime. Using a drying rack is your best course of\naction. The process for washing really is that simple. Next up, let's cover a few maintenance tips\nfor your wool sweaters. To get wrinkles out of your wool garments,\nit's best to use a garment steamer rather than an iron as the heat and pressure from\nan iron will be more likely to distort the natural structure of the fibres. If pilling has occurred, you can take a sweater\ncomb and gently run it across the surface of the fabric in one direction only to remove\nthe pills effectively. Also, using a clothes brush in between wears\nis an easy way to get rid of lint, fuss, and hair and also to release some of those lanolin\noils that keep the sweater looking its best. And if you have been hanging to an old sweater\nthat shrunk in the laundry, there is a way to bring these old sweaters back to life. Add one tablespoon of olive oil to a container\nof hot water, submerge the sweater and swish it around as with the hand washing process\nwe laid out before and then leave the garment to soak in that container overnight. The next day, take the sweater out of the\ncontainer, lay it flat, and block it as desired, and then leave it to dry completely. After it is thoroughly dried, you can wash\nit as normal using the techniques we outlined here. Finally today, let us talk about sweater storage. Woolen knitwear should always be stored folded\nto prevent stretching or distortion of the fibres. Also, woolen cashmere are susceptible to insect\ndamage. When you are storing your wool garments, make\nsure they have been cleaned first so that you are not providing any food sources for\npotential bugs. It is best to store your woolens in a cool\ndry place in a breathable cotton storage bag with a zip closure. Because bugs can get into openings in a seater\nchest over time, the seater will also occasionally lose its effectiveness the longer you have\nit around. Also, storing in plastic encourages yellowing\nand it might also provide a moisture that bugs will love. Optionally here, you can also include in the\nstorage box a sachet of about a half cup of dried lavender since bugs hate the stuff. And there you have it, all the techniques\nnecessary to properly and easily wash your wool sweaters and other garments at home. As we said, you can check out the previous\nvideo in the series here and stay tuned for upcoming installments. So did we blow your mind that wool does not\nactually shrink or did you have a different takeaway from today's video? Whatever the case may be, share with us in\nthe comments below! And as always, do not forget to subscribe\nto the channel and hit the little bell icon so videos like these will come right to you. In today's video, I am wearing an outfit that\nmight be typically worn around the house taking a day to do a little bit of necessary garment\ncare. My medium blue cardigan is especially informal\ngiven its two front pockets. I am wearing it over a shirt from Charles\nTyrwhitt that features a gingham pattern in blue and white. The shirt does have French cuffs but I am\nwearing them configured in a barrel style today so that they fit better under the sleeves\nof the sweater. My cufflinks are vintage silver ones and thy\nfeature a simple geometric pattern that compliments the gingham pattern of my shirt well. My plain brown trousers harmonize well with\nmy shirt and cardigan and on that note, you can check out how to effectively pair brown\nand blue here. If you go along with this color scheme, my\nsocks are plain blue in color but they do feature a subtle stripe in their weave. The outfit today is rounded out by my dark\noxblood penny loafers which are informal in nature and also harmonize well colorwise. I am not really wearing many accessories today\naside from the vintage cufflinks but if you would like to take a look at some other types\nof accessories, just take a look at the Fort Belvedere shop here.", "FAtPNKpc-iY": "[Music] hey what's up everyone thanks for joining us in another video I haven't done a video in a while we've been pretty busy um as you know if you follow us on Instagram we picked up a Sawgrass 800 so I've been busy trying to learn how to work that thing so with the Sawgrass 800 you to print sublimation prints we've been putting stuff like this right here we got that we did do some mugs so I told you with that fiber one he pressed whenever I got a supplement printer that we would do some mugs because the only thing that we really did was the cat press and we pressed a shirt on the platen that it came with but do a video later on with the mug press so we've been looking for something that could print onto cotton with supplement so we've been doing a little research and I found this right here it's called forever sub flex - OH - so it claims that it could press on to 100% cotton so we're gonna give it a try obviously if you've checked my Instagram you know that I've done it and it does print here's a shirt that I did but we're gonna go through what we're gonna do now we're gonna go to the process of how it works so here's one of them right here that is the actual printable vinyl that prints up lamay ssin and you're still gonna press it in Reverse and as you can see if you can see that's 100% cotton um it has the vinyl feel to it because it's actual vinyl here's a here's one right here so here's here's what it prints right here prints like this so you print this after you print it you have to weed it some some vinyl so you look at this one I went to I put this contour cut on here so we could do a contour cut to cut it out but what it did is it moved it over a little bit and then it cut the end of this off over here so this is a waste but we're gonna learn so this like I said this is the bun this is the vinyl right here this is the forever sub flex - OH - it's the actual vinyl so has actual vinyl on it but if you use the polyester shirt like this right here you're going to whenever you press there's no there's no backing on it it actually goes into the actual shirt and you don't have to worry about any vinyl or anything so what we're gonna do today is we're gonna in this video what we're gonna do is where you are going to press this I already printed it and the reason I already printed it is because when it prints on here when it prints on this vinyl you have to let it sit for a while to dry or to cure whatever you want to call it because if you don't once you start to weed it or once you start to cut it you might smear it and that's what happened with this one here whenever I was cutting this out I actually rubbed some of this black and it got onto this right here so when it comes to when you get something on this and then you try to wipe it off it won't because you'll see whenever we press this the image is in Reverse so the ink is actually touching the shirt and then bleeds through the vinyl so we're gonna show you the process of how we do this use you can always put registration works on there and then print it put it back into your cutter and then do a contour cut around the whole thing but with this image right here being that this is a jpg and these are JPEGs this is a jpg it wanted to cut a lot of the it wants to cut a lot of the white out so what I did is I'm just gonna go ahead when I do this we're gonna use an exacto knife to cut around it the best that we can so that we're able to weed it and then we'll press it so let me follow us on Instagram you know that I started selling the Gimme five from B flex I picked up some white and some black I picked up I picked up fifty yards of white 50 yards of black from them we got about 20 yards of white left and about 30 left of black so if you guys need some a hit us up let us know I'll give you a really good price and for those of you that have bought some within this first week started selling it I appreciate you guys 100 percent and also if you're new to my youtube channel thank you for joining thank you for stopping by good to go like our Instagram page alright so for this next part we're gonna take this exacto knife and we're gonna edge around the whole thing if you don't want to watch it you can go ahead and fast-forward to it I'm going to put the camera down while I cut through this and we will fast-forward through one of them I won't show the process for both of them because we're doing two shirts so we're gonna cut this one like I say with the exacto knife if you want a fast walk go ahead so like I said in the last the last one that I did whenever I was whenever I was cutting this as I was cutting around like this being left-handed I smeared a lot of this but now it's dry so I don't have to worry about that I actually printed this and then I waited about an hour so it can get full cured or fully dried so now we're gonna go back with the exacto knife and start to cut this out since I didn't do the contour cut as we're doing this I'm just doing a light cut just to cut through the vinyl so that we can weed this and then press it on to the shirt all right so we got the whole thing done we got the outline done so now I'm gonna come back same thing like whenever you're weeding a piece of vinyl just come in here grab a piece of it then you can just come back in here and do the detail work so if we look here this could come out then I'm gonna pull some of this out all right so we got one of them done went through trimmed up alright so we got one of them done I went ahead and I took this out right here took out this middle part so when it's on the shirt it doesn't feel like a big blob of plastic right here um what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna cut the other one and then we'll press these shirts to see how they look want to say happy Mother's Day to all the mothers out there the mug that we did for somebody got their personal pictures on there so I'll show you but picked up this box at Hobby Lobby for $0.99 put my logo on there not bad though happy Mother's Day right so there's our image all right so here's our image right here we got it it's ready to go the thing with this right here is when you print this turn it upside down so if you do decide if you do have a sublimation printer and you do decide to go with this you do have to flip your image when you press this or whenever you print this out so that whenever you do it it's gonna be this way and the ink will then bleed I guess through the vinyl and you got to press it two times so let's go ahead and put the shredder on here get the moisture out of it alright so as you can see we are gonna be pressing this on 100% cotton so let's go ahead set this up so here it has two different ways to do it we could do a matte finish so we could do a high-gloss finish we're gonna go ahead and go with the high-gloss finish it tells you here to mirror your image and then cut the outline read the white areas we already did all that then it says the press our shirt for five seconds like like you do with any shirt to remove the humidity or the moisture so we're gonna do that so we can get everything out of there the lint roller another thing I didn't tell you is you see this the carrier sheet is not like regular vinyl where it sticks to it so the backing isn't sticky so so this isn't sticky and this isn't sticky it's on there but it's not sticky cuz he's mighty square I usually come three inches down from the neck from the bottom of this arrow so create cheese right there what's ignite 11 inches on both sides all right so here we go we're gonna put this here we're gonna Center it same thing as always I put my hand here to hold it in place this one is not sticky at all we're gonna move it and then we're good there so the next thing so the next thing I'm gonna read right here it says place to place the forever sub flex - OH - transfer onto the garment and put 10 sheets of copy paper on top of it so that goes for matte or gloss so we're gonna put that on top of this so we're gonna do that and then it says for the the gloss Onis it says press 15 seconds then remove the 10 sheets of paper so we're going with the gloss so we're gonna do that I'm still going to put Teflon paper over this so the temperature for this right here is 180 degrees Celsius or 356 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 seconds high pressure so here we go we're gonna press this first one let me make sure I got 15 seconds yep so we're going to press this for 15 seconds they will remove the Tim sheets of paper will set the time for 30 seconds and it should be good so remember with supplementary print sublimation the picture should be shiny and obviously you can see working with right here it should bleed through so says that it bleeds through the vinyl sole scene let's press this [Music] alright so imma go down I'm gonna switch my time now to 30 30 seconds for this next one so there's the first part you can see it started coming through we're gonna go ahead we're gonna press it for 30 seconds like it says let's see what happens so we remove the ten sheets of paper now so we're pressing it for thirty seconds without the ten sheets it says peel backing off once it is completely cold so we're going to do that and we'll see how it looks so as you can see the vinyl press through I mean the sublimation went from the backside it's now on the front everything is the way it's supposed to be we're gonna let this cool down and then we'll look at it well this one cools down I'm gonna press the other one all right so we got one here it's fully its fully cooled its cooled down so it says wait till it's cooled down and it should be should peel right off and there it is so that doesn't look bad at all actually looks pretty good good thing is I cut a lot of this out so you don't have that you don't have that feeling of a big plastic chunk right here it doesn't have the same feel as regular vinyl it's I don't know what it what they use for this but the pictures real shiny alright so there it is we know now that you can buy some vinyl that you could print on with supplement prints it's cause it's forever sub flex - OH - its su be Li sub lies sub lie flex - OH - for light or dark garments for 100% cotton so here's the shirt right here here's how it looks so right here as y'all saw whenever I did whenever else I guess we could say whenever I was using the exacto knife to cut this out I cut this out because when I did the other shirt then I was doing a test on so when I did the test like this I just I had just try it just to try it out it has a big piece of plastic right here in the bottom so I didn't like that the way that plastic stuff feels so it to it to eliminate that I'm on these right here I wonder what they had the knife and I cut all that out so we know that it does work then you can also do it like when I was reading it you could do a matte finish or the high gloss finish inside I'm not gonna tell you who I got it from because I ordered it on eBay just type in the forever sub flex - or - I'm pretty sure pop-up I'm not gonna tell you I ordered it from because the people that I ordered it from a guy here three days late so I'm not gonna put you in that situation yeah we've been we've been rocking and rolling with this supplement stuff if you guys need a mug made if you need some banners may we could do the banners we could do banners like this this one was one of the first ones I did and I printed on the wrong side of the paper when I did the paper I put it on the wrong side so it didn't come out like it was supposed to we could do drawstring bags like this if you need some drawstring bags or if you just want to print you can send me your image as long as it's a good image we could print it on here for you and then once you get it this right here is for polyester only this paper right here you only be able to print onto 100% polyester so if you're trying to clip this onto cutting I don't know if it'll work I'm gonna do a video where I do 100% cotton 100% polyester and then 6040 and then we're gonna print printer up turn on this paper and then press it on each one of those and then wash it and then see what happens after we wash it we'll do that for another video but for now like I said you if you just want the print I just sent some out I could print what you want on it and we could do like the gang chic thing where you put whatever you want on there price will vary between the colors that you need but we can also just send them to so let us know also if you've been following me on instagram you know that we got these right here we we do the mouse pads if you need a mousepad let us know got somebody I haven't done these yet these kingless I ordered a sample pack when I ordered my stuff but these are actually flip-flops so I guess you can put a picture on here you know it's gonna work the same you put your picture on here then it comes with these right here to where you just then it comes with these right here to where you put them in then you have your own personalized flip-flops and then this came with the sample pack - it's a natural puzzle see if you can see the you should be able to see it you can see the puzzle the jigsaw puzzle again same thing put your own image on there and you can make puzzle for yourself let's let us know if you need anything and also last and also don't forget we are selling the bee flex vinyl if y'all need any of it let us know we'll give you a really good price whenever you I don't have the website up so if you if you need some send me a direct message on Instagram you'll be talking to me straight we'll be talking back and forth it's not something get to do online right now so yeah I just hit us up and let us know but so as you all know we're doing the vital thing we started doing the supplement thing so like I said y'all need anything let us know and then last but not least we ordered a four in one screen printing kit to see give it a try see how it goes so that thing came in yesterday FedEx jacked up the whole box it was all jacked up so the company that I ordered it from was like open it up and there's anything wrong with it let me know and we'll take care of it so that's cool hello so hope I didn't do an unboxing on the 4700 I did but I think I'm

how to wash your suits at home in the washing\nmachine. Sound crazy? Well, just stay tuned for our techniques and you'll be\nconvinced. This video is the third on another series we've done on garment\ncare and maintenance the previous two videos in the series focused on shoe\ncare and how to fold different kinds of garments you can take a look at those\nvideos by clicking the banners at right. also if you haven't seen them don't\nforget to take a look at our previous series on garment care which discussed\nremoving the musty smell from vintage clothing how to wash and maintain wool\nsweaters some cheap and easy laundry hacks you can use and also how to remove\nstains from different kinds of garments. As we stated in the intro though, today's\nvideo will focus on washing suits at home. Now, you may be thinking why would I\never want to attempt something so sartorially risky as putting a heavily\nstructured garment like a suit jacket or blazer in my washing machine at home? The\nsimple answer is because there are techniques you can use to wash them in\nyour machine without any fear of damaging the garments and therefore, save\nmoney that you otherwise would have had to spend at the dry cleaners. Wouldn't a\nwool suit get ruined and shrink in the wash? You might be wondering. Again, the\nanswer is no. Not if you're using the proper techniques. We've already debunked\nsome of the myths surrounding wool and how to wash it in our video on\nmaintaining wool sweaters. In the broad strokes though, do fight the urge to take\nyour garments to the dry cleaner every time they need to be washed because the\nharsh solvents used in dry cleaning will degrade and break down garment fibers\nover time. Furthermore, water doesn't actually shrink wool garments rather the\nagitation that can be caused by a washing machine or more likely a dryer\nwill cause wool fibers to seize together or felt. Therefore, the\nprimary thing you should be looking out for when washing your garments is preventing\nfelting or for non woollen garments, other damage to the fibers. Convinced yet?\nWell, if not, we'll go over the washing process step-by-step. First to start out\nwith, you're going to want to make sure that the garments in question are\nproperly folded in order to minimize excess agitation that might occur during\nwashing. We covered the best way to fold all different kinds of menswear garments\nin our previous video in this series you can find that video here. You should then\nsimply use those folding techniques with two added caveats. First of all, turn your\ntrousers and/or your waistcoat inside out before folding them so that any\npotential felting will be on the inside of the garments. Of course, your jacket\nwill end up inside out using the folding method we outlined as normal. Second, you\nshould end all folding processes not by folding into thirds but by rolling from\nthe bottom to the top as tightly as possible but without causing any undue\nbunching. By rolling your garments tightly, you're going to minimize how\nmuch they can move and thus prevent any felting that might occur. Next, place each\nindividual rolled garment into its own separate mesh washing bag. The bag should\nalso be rolled up as tightly as possible and secured with safety pins as\nnecessary. Next, add an appropriate amount of cleaning agent to your washing\nmachine depending on the number of garments being washed. A general ratio of\nabout one tablespoon per garment works well for small loads and for larger\nloads, just follow the standard directions for your specific machine. A\ngentle cleaning agent like wool and cashmere shampoo should be added to the\ndrawer of the machine if you are washing wool suits, and soap flakes can be put\ndirectly into the drum of the machine if you're washing non woolen suits. You\ndon't have to select the cycle for woollen\nor delicates on your machine if all of your garments are properly secured in\ntheir individual mesh bags; the Express cycle is fine for most applications. Once\nthe machine is finished with all of its cycles, promptly remove your garments\nfrom the washing machine and take them out of their individual mesh bags to\nprevent any additional creasing. Next, let's cover drying. A word of warning\nhere, don't use your dryer as the heat and\nagitation that will occur inside the machine are prime conditions for felting\nyour garments which of course, you don't want rather each of your garments should\nbe laid flat in their natural shapes on a drying rack. You can speed up this\ndrying process a bit by first laying a clean towel down on a work surface. With\neach item in its original shape, gently roll the item up in the towel like a\nsleeping bag to remove some of the excess water. Wait a few seconds, unroll\nthe towel, and then place the garments on a drying rack. You can reshape or block\nyour garments a bit with your hands while they're on the drying rack just to\nmake sure that everything is shaped as properly as possible. After most of the\nmoisture has evaporated, you can move your jacket from the drying rack back to\nits original hanger just to make sure that its shoulders and other padded\nareas dry in their natural shape. A few additional tips here, avoid placing your\ngarments in direct sunlight or near heat sources like a radiator while they're\ndrying as this can cause shrinking or yellowing of the fibers. Also, never hang\nwet woolens up right away as gravity will pull on the water that's still\nlocked into the fibers meaning that your garment's shape will probably be\ndistorted. To remove any wrinkles after your garments are dry, using a garment\nsteamer is best on structured items like jackets. If you'd like to intentionally\nreintroduce a crease to a garment, say on the legs of your trousers, for example,\nthat would be a good time to use an iron. If any pilling\nhas happened to occur to your garments, you can take a pill comb and gently run\nit across the fabric in one direction to remove those pills. Also, using a clothes\nbrush in between wears is a good way to more generally remove lint, fuzz, and hair\nfrom your clothing. Finally, today, here are some quick notes on hand washing and\nspot treatment. If you can believe it, hand washing suits is actually a little\nbit trickier than machine washing because working these structured\ngarments around in a basin and trying to wash them completely can be a little bit\nunwieldy. If you're trying to wash the entire garment, using your machine is\nactually best. For spot treatment of specific areas, all you have to do is use\na small amount of the relevant cleaning agent and a little bit of warm water and\ngently blot at the stain. Don't scrub at it or you might felt woolens and\notherwise damage different types of fibers. We've just washed the jacket\ntoday for illustration purposes but obviously, these techniques and methods\napply to all other elements of a suit as well including the trousers and the\noptional waistcoat. What you're seeing here is the jacket after it was allowed\nto fully dry, this is after about two days time and what you're seeing here is\nthe jacket after a garment steamer has been used to steam out the remaining\nwrinkles so that they're either gone or mostly gone. In other words, the jacket\nlooks just as good as it did before it was washed and there you have it! All the\ntechniques necessary to wash your suits in your washing machine at home. If\nyou're still apprehensive about trying this method, we would suggest that you do\nit with a non woolen suit first as it will probably be a little bit less\ntemperamental and there will be no chance of felting. So we'd like to know,\nare you courageous enough to attempt this method of washing your suits?

see the lights i'm going to get there and hope we will meet there [Music] uh [Music] you", "LI3GpG3STDk": "hello everybody my name is Jennifer maker tonight we are talking about infusible inks and what kinds of t-shirts so what kind of fiber content and what colors we can put them on I'm the great maker show and tell so ever since crickets and fusible links came out folks have been asking me what we can put them at now Cricut has a lot of official blanks they have t-shirts and they have tote bags and they have coasters but what if you are a different size than the t-shirts that are available because this the sizes I believe are small to 2x so what if you're a larger size or what if you like a different style of t-shirt but what if you want a different color or a whole lot of different things what if we don't want 95% polyester and you want in 5% spandex which is what the Cricut shirts are what if you need a little bit more cotton content right so tonight we are going to look at over 15 it's actually 19 different t-shirts that I have already tested and already washed so we're going to look at them we're going to look at them in some cases we're gonna be able to see what they look like before they're washed but we'll be able to compare what they look like after they've been washed so you can see how they held up and how they look in the first place and everything like that now if you have questions please feel free to shut your question now and I will do my best to answer it my team is here thank you guys so much for being here and we'll help out with questions to the best of their ability and I actually have a blog post that has links to the t-shirts that I found on Amazon and actually it's a list of all the shirts that we're testing tonight it's over on my blog at jennifermcguireink.com I tested and then show you what they look like before we wash them and after we wash them so let's head on over to my workspace and I can explain what I have done for you and also I can love them to check the screen and look for questions as well all right so let's head on over there and take a look okay so here is my stack of white t-shirts there's quite a few of them here they've all I have already put them put the image on I have used the exact same image and every single one so we can compare and look at the color transfer and everything I picked this rainbow transfer sheet that comes in this is the Shaylee infusible ink box so it's this one right here and I put this wing tart on every single one of these 19 shirts to show you and so this one here at the top this is the cricket shirt this is the one that is sold at Michael stores right now exclusively it's at Michael's stores and this is the one that Cricut guarantees that they're a fusible links will work on but as you can see there's a lot more shirts here that I tested with so we're gonna find out what else works especially in terms of the fiber content for these because these are all white which is like really the perfect color to use in fusible links on because in fusible links are not like vinyl where it just sits right on top of the surface it is instead an ink it's a kind of sublimation ink that actually infuses into the surface of the t-shirt so there's nothing here it just feels like t-shirt so it's really very awesome if you're not familiar with in fusible ink technology I have lots of videos I have an ultimate guide to it we did we've done several play tests on how this works in fact here's the quick little preview of me creating all 19 of these t-shirts using my Cricut ez press 2 and infusible ink now this is sped up a lot as you can imagine but you can see here how I am putting the in fusible ink transfer which is the heart with the wings that I created on my Cricut onto my t-shirt know that I'm using the paper underneath to protect my mat as well as two sheets to put your paper on top of my shirt to protect from scorching and that thing it's also important to note that I am preheating each of these shirts before I put my design at I am using crickets instructions so we are heating me my ez press is at three hundred and eighty five degrees Fahrenheit and I'm doing it pressing for forty seconds but do exactly what the Cricut ez press guide tells us to do now of course it doesn't know that I'm using all these different kinds of shirts so I'm simply following the same directions for all of the shirts so all the shirts are three hundred eighty five degrees for 40 seconds I also want to note that normally you want to wait before you remove at the transfer for the shirt you want to wait till it cools down I edited this video so you weren't just watching nothing while it I wait for it to cool down so it's just important again if you're not familiar with how to use infeasible ink please check out my tutorials I had a great tutorial on how to do t-shirts that shows you step-by-step exactly what to do and then putting that link for you right here on the screen so you can head on over there and check it out now let's look at each t-shirt that I tested with Cricut infeasible ink up close this is the cricut shirts this is what we're gonna compare everything to so this is the one that guaranteed that cricut guarantees will work with it's in fusible ink transfer sheets and markers okay so let's compare how this looks to the what it looks like before it was washed so we move that over there we go okay so here we go on the left you can see the pre-washed version and on the right you can see it washed and you can see it looks identical there's no difference at all okay next shirt so this is the one that hopefully everything will look as good as this this is I mean this is our goal it's not going to happen guys but this is what we would like okay now remember infusible ink really needs polyester or polymer to bind to and that's why it's so important what our shirt content is all right so here is 100% poly sir this is what look like before we washed it and this is what looks like after it looks the same to me and this is a shirt that I found on Amazon it is kind of feels like an athletic shirt it's sort of shiny rather than being soft right but it takes the infusible ink really really well and there's a link to that if you want to find this shirt there's a link to this in my blog and then my blog post okay so next one so this is the 92 percent polyester 8% spandex still looks the same to me 92% polyester is really really a high current polyester so this looks good so again the one on the left is the pre-wash and this one is after it's been washed okay so this looks great this shirt is a No Boundaries shirt and I got it from Walmart for I don't know like five bucks or something very inexpensive okay next shirt is 90% polyester so and this one didn't quite like something happens I've seen this happen once in a while and I haven't figured out what it is it's possible that it's just not a good shirt to start with I don't know so this is a Tara and Skye's shirt that I also found at Walmart 90% polyester 10% spandex and it's the color looks the same to me as I did before I washed it I don't see any difference in color just we have this kind of faded spot here again I don't know if it's because of the quality of the shirt which is certainly possible or if it's just a user error alright next shirt so this is an eighty percent polyester twenty percent cotton and now I think that we can see just a tiny little bit of fading maybe maybe I'm just seeing things they actually look really similar to me so this is a Fruit of the Loom shirt and it came like a pack for it was really affordable I got this on Amazon I believe and I had the link to this one in my blog post and but it looks really now the only thing that I see like looking at it with my naked eye which you guys might not be able to see like I I don't know it does look a little bit so tell me a bit faded you can see the fibers of the cotton kind of peeking through but it's not bad or anything it's it's not bad alright next shirt is a 65% polyester 30 percent cotton George brand and this comes from Walmart and I think it looks really similar to the one that we just saw just a little bit of fading not so vibrant and let's just to compare it let's get out the cricket one over here so you can see so this here is the cricket one you see that you see how it is a little bit more vibrant know if you see that right it's definitely the green and the yellow they're all popping just a little bit more but that bad and these shirts are really inexpensive now I want to note that the Georgia actually has two different polyester cotton blends one has a lot of polyester and one has a lot of Cotton's so you'll want to check the label and don't just assume if you go to Walmart looking for George that you got the right one okay so this is the 65 polyester 30 percent cotton alright so this here is now I can you guys can definitely see a difference here right so this is the 40% polyester 60% cotton George brands this is also from Walmart and there these are like based I found them really close to each other and they're like in the men's section by the way I didn't really find any of these in the women's section but but I think this is a v-neck yeah this is a v-neck so I mean it still looks like a nice shirt but you can see that fading here right you can see that that it's just sort of more washed out right now note that how it looked when you first did it and how it looks now right so thing is is that even though it looks really good when you first make it if you're putting it on something that isn't able where the inks not able to bind with it you're gonna get this fading okay maybe you're okay with that but this is after one wash I don't know how it's going to look in Ted and washes or 50 washes it could get really light okay so keep that in mind and let's look at the last one which is 100% cotton so this is a huge difference I mean this is like pastel now so this is a hundred percent cotton now on the Left we can see that it came and faded it started to faded right which it kind of looks nice it has a like a retro look right it's totally cool but this is after one wash okay this is like super pastel now this is almost like something a baby might wear but the thing is is that after I feel really confident that after a few washes we're barely gonna be able to say this it's just gonna look like a mistake at that point so 100% cotton is not going to be a good choice to use with an fusible ink even though it might look okay when you first put it on after washing it it's just going to be a disappointment I really recommend that you pay attention to your polyester cap the higher you go up the more vibrant it gets and the longer it's going to last when you wash it right I mean look these look really awesome I mean this one I have no okay it's amazing I mean look at how that look that good in fact let's just compare this one to the cotton I mean look at the difference here guys that is a huge difference this is they're both have been washed exactly the same they were washed together so big big difference the more polyester you have the better it's going to look so hopefully that helps you guys and of course you can see that there's a lot of different shirts because the thing is is that I know that the cricket shirts aren't going to work for everybody they don't come in all the sizes they don't even have they don't even have sizes for like kids right now they just have the small through 2x in the women's and the men's and at my Michaels I couldn't even find it to X's so if you can find them I mean I think these shirts are the cricket shirts are really really amazing because they're stupid they don't even feel like polyester this one feels like pilot this one here this would definitely feels like polyester this their cricket shirts don't they're very soft there's something about the way that they're woven and the type of fibers that they're using it's making a difference so if the cricket shirt is available in your size and style get that and if it's not then use one of these alternatives okay alright so do you guys have any questions about these various white shirts before I switch over to the colored shirts because I did all of those and I would love it to show you those ginger says can we use 100% polyester yes totally this is 100% polyester this is right here it looks amazing it looks great it will work I believe it's going to work just as well as the cricket shirts too and really add just a little bit looks amazing it's very vibrant Peggy says I have a 100% polyester sheet that's too big for my bed I'm gonna have fun playing and you know something Peggy that's a great idea I thought about going to the fabric store and just getting a bunch of fabric in different sizes to test but I wanted to be able to show you actual t-shirts that you could purchase like whatever store because I know that you guys are looking for t-shirts alright so I think that OH Alex asks where is a hundred percent polyester shirt from this comes from Amazon this is the Hanes cool dry and this is a woman's shirt but they have them in this woman's v-neck so it's really nice fitted shirt but they also have them in men's and stuff I really like this this I've gotten this brand several times it is polyester it's like it has very very smooth rather than soft finish but hey maybe that's okay with you okay cool all right let's move on to the colored shirts here is the stack of colored shirts I got a whole bunch of colors now you'll note that they're mostly pastel because this is eight it's not vinyl it's ink and it's transparent ink it's not going to look good on like a navy blue shirt and we're gonna talk about that later don't worry it's going to look if you're gonna put it on to a colored shirt because you don't like white or whatever it's gonna look best on these light pastel colors okay otherwise it's just not going to be visible because it's transparent ink alright so we're gonna start with them 100% polyester shirt this is a 100% polyester shirt it's the same cool dry Hanes shirt that I showed you in the white one okay I got this from Amazon exact same shirt v-neck women's shirt can you see this white outline here this is where my piece of transfer me see if I have one that can show you so this is the fusible link transfer so you know it was on here like this so see the marking here so I've seen this show up on a number of people's shirts that they posted and I don't know why it does but it's there even after we washed it so you need to watch for this because maybe you're okay with this maybe you're not okay with this right but the color looks pretty good you can see how the blue basically is there's like no blue because it's not a blue shirt everything that's significant and also because this is transparent ink a lot of the colors are changing from what we would see and white to you know like this is supposed to be yellow but it looks green right so that's something to take into account right this should be pink and it looks like it's purple right but it transferred pretty well and it washed really well okay so this one has that box around it all right this one oh my gosh I really dislike this shirt this shirt came from Walmart and it's a very vibrant color don't wouldn't you say so I did this let's see if I can even show you I can and you know when we do in fusible ink we need to cut me to cover our mats so that the in fusible ink itself does not bleed through onto our pressing mats well look what this lovely shirt did it was it's so vibrant I washed these by the way it was so vibrant that it transferred its own ink to my pressing pad and now I will forever have to be careful this yeah so this one this is not sure that I'm gonna recommend to anybody but I found it at Walmart and it's 92 percent polyester 8% spandex and it's got this annoying box around it again from the transfer sheet I don't know what this is cause fraud by but I personally don't like it I don't like the way it looks at all so I would say this is a no-go yes yes Alex they were all pre-washed okay so here is the 80 percent polyester 20 percent cotton Athletics work shirt I found this at Walmart it was in the clearance section I don't even know if they still saw this but whatever it's like actually a tank top or a racerback shirt or something so I can't really see a white box around this one of course it's got a different texture to it actually came out really well you know it doesn't look like it faded very much maybe just the tiniest bit but not much it's pretty good and the colors are vibrant and amazingly the pink still transferred to this one I guess it was light enough I know no it's interesting but this one was actually pretty good so this one came from Walmart again so Rhonda says maybe the design can be cut closer to get rid of that scare get rid of the square and apply heat and use it beautiful heat tape yeah I think that's a possibility you would have to cut all the way through or trim around it and that might be a lot of work but here's the thing is that you'll notice that on other shirts you can't see it so it's something about I'm thinking it's something about the way this shirt is colored but I don't know for sure just taking a wild guess here this here is 65% polyester 35% cotton this is the same George brand that I showed you in the white shirts which i think is actually pretty a pretty good I think he's pretty they're really inexpensive and I don't know I think four or five dollars per shirt and they come in a lot of different sizes a lot of different sizes and different colors so I like this this has a tiny bit of fading but it's it looks really good to me still so I think this is a winner and I actually got a bunch of these so we could look at how the color transferred to these so that's the purple one and I'll slide these over see we can compare this is a blue one same exact shirt just different color so again it looks a lot better on this purple than it does on the blue the blue is definitely changing the transparent ink in a different way and that's significant if you are you know what color you're trying to decide I actually this isn't pink this is purple I don't know what color I said this is purple just that's clear and this is like a light blue the George brand is from Walmart and again it's important to note that they come in different they have some that have more polyester and some that have more cotton you want the ones with more polyester it really is going to make a difference here is another one and this is a it's kind of a orange a pink color I guess salmon we would call it call that and it looks you know I can see fading here it might be hard to see in the camera I'm looking at it from a different angle and I can kind of see it like at a 45 degree angle so I could see the fibers of the cotton shirt better still looks really good though I think that looks really good I think this is actually a good shirt so after testing it what six times I think I tested it six times okay so here so this here is a totally different shirt this is a Gildan shirt that I found I believe at Michaels maybe it was at Joanne's it was at one of the craft stores and it's 50% polyester and 50% cotton and it's blue so the design didn't transfer as well as it might have done in a lighter color a more Pinker color but it did transfer pretty well hard to say how long and I'll contain a hold up in the wash but it looks pretty good right now all right so here is the George brand that is less cotton less re less polyester and more cotton and while this looks this design it looks pretty good because this is such a light color it's pretty faded I don't know if I have one I could compare we can compare it to this pink one over here set these aside so here is this is a 80% cotton sorry 80% polyester and this one here is the 40% polyester and you can see that this is quite a bit more vibrant than this right so you know I mean but maybe you're ok with it maybe you're ok wearing your shirt for a few times and it's not that big of a deal maybe it's a special occasion shirt right I mean there's always possibilities here nothing is ever really you know if you really really like cotton more you know just wear your shirt a little less or you use it as a save it so this is I think this is actually still pretty I think it's gonna fade a lot more as you wash it though just so you know all right and let's look at 100% cotton that's been washed it looked a little better when we put it put it out initially this is what it looks like when it's been washed you can't even see the color at this point it's just kind of like some green and some brownish colors and I think that if we wash this like five five more times I bet it would be just barely a shadow something that was here once ginger says a solid and fusible ink would probably look good on the Gildan blue shirt you know so they're all they all of the in fusible links they're all transparent so if we had used purple it would look like this right if we had used green it would look like this so you can't this is actually sorry this is pink that purple sorry right so this is orange this is pink this is like red this is purple here and this is blue so you know I mean it's still going to take on the color underneath it so remember our color wheel and when we mix colors we're going to get these we're going to get a different color than what you expect when you put it onto something that's got the base color is this dark so keep that in mind okay alright so let's see yes so someone mentioned the black shirt so we're gonna talk about that because of course we tested a black shirt guys I said I would here is our black shirt mm-hmm and yes I put in fusible in cactus when I move this so this is got the design let's see if we can see this at all it has been washed you can kind of see right yeah the guys probably can't see that but I can kind of see a rectangle there gosh it's not even focusing it's like just black let's put this back on and give it something to focus on there truly is feasible in care we show you about where it went it's probably right about I'm gonna match it up to this rectangle it looks like it was right about here okay this is where I put it the thing is though infeasible and gets transparent so what happens when you put transparent anything I'm black we get this we get nothing this is what it looks like just don't even bother don't do this because it's a waste of your infusible ink it's not it's there literally is infeasible in canvas but because it's transparent you cannot see it okay but if anyone saw my preview image then you saw that I did have something on a black shirt okay and by the way this if you're curious this is a George shirt with 40% polyester okay alright so let's flip this shirt over so I can show you now I tried some different things first off I tried white flocking vinyl that I got it's like a so you can find that yes here it is I tried Caeser strip flock Pro HTV just I don't know just for the heck of it just see what would happen and I put the white on first and then after the white was away I applied it normally but you would normally apply heat transfer and then over the top of the white I put my infusible ink and as you can see it did indeed transfer right it's not go in the dark now but it did transfer and this has been washed it's still there guys it is still there so that was my first test to see if we get this in fusible ink on a black shirt now you might be wondering why on earth would anybody care just use vinyl and I agree you probably just wanted you to find out but if you just love the use the feeding patterns you just really want to put this on a shirt of your choice then these are our options so this is using the strip flock Pro HDTV that I found this at Michael's by the way I think there's actually a better product I think it's called sub flock and I think it's actually better at absorbing the sublimation ink so I haven't I don't have my hands on it yet but I have heard about it okay so this is um flocking HDTV but then Miranda who is my Miranda is my customer service angel she said that she saw i'm youtube that people were using glitter a heat transfer vinyl so i got some of that and this is what happened so this is white glitter heat transfer vinyl Julie says that I spray that know that this this is heat transfer vinyl this is vinyl so is this these are both vinyl and they come white like this so here is the white glitter and here is the the flock the flocking is like super like soft stuff right from like this seven days right you know the wallpaper that kind of [ __ ] so this started as white glitter heat transfer and I cut out my heart in the same mean of the same heart and I put it on to the black shirt in the normal way that you put on heat transfer nothing special and then I took my my infusible ink transfer and I put it right on top of the white glitter heat transfer and I did I follow the normal directions for pressing it so I believe I did this at 385 degrees for 40 seconds which is what I did all of these shirts at by the way and this is what I got and doesn't this look amazing so this has been washed and it still looks to me as good as it did when I put it on it did not fade it on this one faded this one did not fade this one looks really really good I think that this white so if you really just really want to put invisible eight onto a black or navy blue or a dark purple shirt then this is what you should do put some white glitter heat transfer vinyl and by the way this is the cricket brand this is um we just got bought this down at our Joanne's that's five minutes from a house I actually said Greg a prank I need some white glitter heat transfer vinyl he's like okay he did it for me thank you Greg and then I put this on here and it worked so this is not my original idea I think that this existed long before we had infeasible ink because I bleach I went and looked it up on YouTube and people have been putting doing this for sublimation ink for years okay so this is not I'm not taking credit for this idea but thank you Miranda for letting me know about this so yeah so if you really want to use a dark shirt Becky says did the glitter show through yeah you can tell it's very pretty actually let me show you I said we can get this closer and then light here can you guys see the glitter see isn't that pretty I think it's really pretty is it really the glitter actually makes the colors pop a little bit more so and someone had concerns that it would wash right out but didn't for me the flocking did but not this this looks great so there we go alright so I'm gonna switch back over to me and I'm gonna see if you guys have questions okay alright awesome so let's see so Stephanie says I just joined this live stream and I've tried the infusible in kind of mint green shirt and it came out beautiful awesome I'm super glad to hear that I've been seeing a lot of people using pastel shirts that looks great remember the key is the higher the polyester count the better is going to look and one thing I want to note as we move down from into the higher cotton shirts I noticed more scorching going on the cotton does not like that super high temperatures at the at the links that we need to go to for in fusible ink and when I did the 100% cotton shirt I saw weird brown marks show up on my shirt and I want to see if they came out in the wash okay so this is a hundred percent cotton shirt you know doesn't really I don't really see looks like a lot of it might have washed out it doesn't look too maybe just a little bit I can kind of see on the sides just a tiny little bit if I wasn't looking for this I wouldn't be able to see any scorching so it actually would have the discoloration did come out when we washed it that's good so if you're seeing discoloration in your cotton shirts which probably shouldn't be using guys but if you want to use them anyways try washing them to see if you can get that out just keep that in mind so if it scorches it's too cotton just doesn't like it that hot for that lot Lutie says do you think it would work better on cotton with the glitter first yep yep if you really want to use have a hundred percent cotton shirt in but you really want a fusible ink because you love those patterns put that white glitter HTV on the shirt and then put your fusible link transfer on it one tip I have for that is I noticed that as we heat the fusible entry four sheets they shrink just a little bit so if you tape it down in the exact spot you want it to go your shirt kind of been shrinks along with it instead of it shrinking without the shirt and then it looks at mal matches up better and it stays in position better so definitely use the cricket heat transfer tape when you are putting the in fusible ink transfers on top of the white glitter htb yes I washed all of these shirts first because we don't want to worry about whether we have sizing in them or anything like that just it's so they're you know there's kind of like differing opinions about whether you should wash them first cricket by the way doesn't say that we need to wash these first for infusible ink so don't think that matters but you know it helps with like shrinking and stuff the only time that you might not want to wash a shirt forces if you're playing to sell it because it never looks new after you washed it right so instead of get ones that are pre sized you know so they're already black preshrunk and then but don't wash them and then you know it looks better that's what I hear at least I don't sell my shirts or anything like that necie says is there an easy way to weed the invisible ink I think it's actually really easy to weed I did all of these hearts and there's like Oh a lot of them superfast if you use the bend and crack method you know so you're just kind of bending it and making sure all the edges are lifting up it actually comes off really easily and if you watched my other videos you can see me actually weeding the the transfer sheets and how it's different right it's different than how we weed vinyl and I like it a lot better Vicky says does the glitter after the imputable ink feel like vinyl nope it feels like glitter it feels like um I mean just touch it again it feels you know so you know the way glitter feels it's got almost like a kind of like sandpaper II feel because it's got all the little glitter parts embedded in it that is what it feels like Janet says what time and temperature did you use for these shirts I used that I used crickets easy press heat guide for all of four bases you know I used it for cricket shirts so only when it gives me a time for so I use the exact same time and temperature for all of them which was three hundred eighty five degrees am i easy press two for forty seconds you could also have done your easy press one at what would it be three hundred and sixty degrees because it's the highest it goes up so probably a little longer I just don't happen to know what that is but Cricut has an excellent heat press guide that you would just use to determine what that would be thank you Joe I'm really happy that you like my testing I'm checking for more questions to see if you guys have any more questions before I wrap up tonight this is a great time to throw them out there for us Lori says what do you do with a different heat settings for vinyl and then infuse oblique so I simply followed the heat transfer settings for vinyl and once it was in place I let it cool a little bit so you know it was more you know wasn't like still you know in fact you have to wait until the glitter is cool to even pull off the backing anyways and when I put I didn't had no issues it worked I simply used the same settings for them fusible ink that I use for all the other shirts when I put it on top of the glitter so I didn't even worry about it because it was a test right it was okay to try it and if it didn't work then oh well we just try it again so but it worked so I used the normal settings for glitter heat transfer vinyl and then I use the normal settings for infeasible ink on top of that white glitter Megan says do we use the butcher paper so I made a lot of t-shirts I did not use two sheets of butcher paper for brand new sheets of butcher paper for each of these shirts so I found that my butcher paper wasn't transferring nothing was getting transferred to it I was having no issues and I I think I only ended up using like four sheets for all of these shirts so I reused it I always checked it to make sure that I didn't see any anything being transferred to it that would then transfer to one of my new shirts but it didn't so it was fine Ginetta says I was hoping it would test depends my experience there's no difference between how the pens and a transfer sheets go on to materials if you are curious about how the pens I have a whole video on that right so you can just watch that video but I've seen no difference and how they transfer they transfer the same it's the same ink it's just ones coming out of the pen and ones on a transfer sheet but it looks the same once we transfer it it acts we transfer it the same way it looks the same so it wasn't necessary to do all of the testing Gina asked if the white transfer the white glitter was stiff like final yes it is because it's white it's white but it's white glitter vinyl that's there the white cleared of metal doesn't go away so it has that same it's not super stiff but there's definitely something there it's not like the awesomeness that is in fusible ink where it's totally weightless right you still it feels like vinyl with that's been colored that's basically what while we're doing here all right let me just get that at the bottom let's see someone mentioned parchment paper no do not use parchment paper parchment paper has a coating on it what your paper does not if you use parchment paper or wax paper you can transfer that coating to your shirt I have seen it done and it looks bad don't do it guys don't waste your shirts use butcher paper you can get it on Amazon very inexpensively I have a giant roll of it let me show ya I will put a menu remember my team can put the link this is my big roll of butcher paper it's gonna last a really really long time it was really inexpensive you can get it pretty sure her people say they got theirs at Walmart or their local grocery store but you want white butcher paper don't substitute in this case it's going to be a disappointment it's not freezer paper either guys it's not freezer paper put your paper freezer paper has a coating at it in fact the most famous one has a plastic coating on it you do not want to transfer that to your shirt what's your paper it doesn't have the coating you want that yesthank right ginger says put your paper parchment paper and freezer paper are all different it's important that you use the right one because that coating will transfer I've seen it happen okay I think I have gotten everyone's questions just double-checking Ossie says can you use a heat press yes you can I just don't have one so I use my easy press so we use an easy press Mary says where would I find the video about the Pens well I'll tell you what if you go to my youtube channel at youtube.com slash C / Jennifer maker all of my videos are there tons of them and that's where you'll find my video about the Pens as well as my video about that fusible link tote bag and the infeasibility t-shirt and infusible inks in general like I have I think I have 5 or 6 videos on a fusible links at this point yep I mean that's I think I got them all so I want to remind everybody that we're still having our summer maker giveaway so we are giving away a Cricut

ideas and I love hearing your ideas for things and oh one more question Stephanie says did I use dryer sheets nope you're not supposed to use any dryer sheets Gregg did the washing and drying did you use dryer sheets nope no dryer sheets because that's what the instructions say the instructions say to turn them inside out wash them and cold inside out and then tumble dry low no dryer sheets no bleach and no fabric softener and that's what we did so Mal detergent right yes Gregg says mild detergent okay I think that's it thank you everybody for being here tonight thank you for your questions for putting up with our technology issues I always appreciate it and I hope to see you next week and I think that's it thank you so much for joining me remember if you can tell me what you'd like to

what we got in another plaid but it is sherpa lined so safe and soft i love it so it is a gray black and red plaid um it has this cute little pocket right here um these are a little bit warmer because it has the sherpa line but it's just in the body the sleeves are not sherpa lined um i'm in a size small and so it's true to size i can button it um shanna was in a 2x so her normal size there is no stretch in these sleeves whatsoever so you can see it is loose on me but in the shoulders no stretch at all so true to size but if you're not 100 sure because like if you want to try it on because there's no stretch come in and see me but we do have all the sizes which is super exciting so we have small through 3x and yeah i mean i can button this up in a size small i love flannels you guys it is just now that it's cooling off it's like flannel season and you can go sit outside in the cool mornings and drink your coffee and this would be perfect for that so again small through 3x um i think they're gonna go quick so snag it online or in the app anyways hope you're all having a great day", "qLnjLPuEum8": "hey my name is jessica and i just finished remaking this t-shirt quilt and if you want to see how i did that keep watching i taught myself how to sew for one very specific reason and that reason is i had accumulated a lot of t-shirts that i didn't really want to wear anymore but also felt too attached to to get rid of now each of these shirts was from a special occasion or job or event or something and had a graphic or logo on the front of it and i thought that if i cut all of these out and assembled them together i could make a very cute quilt the only problem with that is i hadn't sewn anything before in my life but luckily i had a number of talented sewists in my family including my mom so i borrowed her sewing machine and started working on my quilt now i started working on this quilt at a very very beginner level i had to download the manual and learn all the different parts of the machine i had to google how to wind a bobbin and thread a machine so i really started with very little knowledge but kept working and finally finished my quilt and i never returned my mom's sewing machine and since then i've made a few more quilts i've made a few things for the house and i've started making clothes as well there are a lot of things and that i want to learn and projects on my list but at the end of 2020 i was motivated to remake my quilt and i was always really proud of this quilt it was the first big sewing project i ever finished it was an example of me having an idea and actually executing that idea and it really was this project that started my love and this hobby of sewing so for a lot of reasons that quilt was really special aesthetically speaking though there were always a few things that bothered me so i thought that the quilt was a little too small so it was great for putting on your lap but it didn't cover you if you wanted to take a nap or if you wanted to sit two people on the couch and it wasn't until i was making my second quilt and googling more about you know how to design it and lay it out that i realized that a border was another element that you could add to a quilt and that was always something that i felt was missing from my first one and the last thing that i wanted to fix was the backing and the batting layers i wanted to opt for something that was a little bit higher quality and go for something that was a bit thinner as well so i essentially wanted to change every single layer of this quilt so to do that i have to start deconstructing the quilts which starts with taking off the binding the binding finishes the raw edges of the quilts for this quilt i machine stitched the binding to the front wrapped it around the edges and then hand sewed it to the back i was not sure how secure my hand sewing would be so i made very small stitches on the back side which took me a while to take apart the binding step always feels long especially when you're doing it by hand so it would make sense that taking it apart takes a long time too once the binding is off it's time to take apart the top stitches that secure all three layers together so for the most part for the binding and these top stitches i used a seam ripper i also used these very sharp scissors which helps cut through the loose stitches and particularly difficult bits of fabric scissors can be more damaging to the fabric so i used them carefully or when i was okay losing some of my fabric once all of the stitches were out i separated the quilt top into its individual patches so for some t-shirts my original seam ran very close to the graphic if not on the actual graphic so in these cases i used my seam ripper to preserve as much fabric as possible for graphics that had lots of negative space on the sides i just used my rotary cutter and mat to cut along the seam line this was a quick way to separate the shirts and i was all about saving time at this point after the deconstruction phase i gathered all of the materials i would need for the quilt top i went through my drawers and found other t-shirts to include a really important step in preparing the t-shirts is to interface them so that they no longer stretch originally i used and am using now a fusible interfacing which requires an iron i'm using 100 cotton interfacing but you can find it in synthetic and poly cotton blends as well it takes some time for the fabric to fuse but patience and a bit of steam can help you i'm also going to use scrap fabric in some of my stash for quilt improvising i learned of this technique also called crumb quilting or improv piecing when i was looking for ideas on how to use up small pieces of fabric i started to coordinate my scraps with t-shirts but stopped because i wasn't sure if i would add scraps to every shirt instead i decided to use my scraps to make a bunch of different size patches that i could fit into gaps as i laid my quilt out i wanted to avoid big patches of the same fabric and instead use small triangles and rectangles to create busy and chaotic blocks to do this i cut a lot of diagonal lines to introduce all sorts of angles and seam lines in all directions and even though i'm introducing diagonals and sewing things at angles i do ultimately want to end up with a rectangular block with square corners to help me visualize how a new piece of fabric will change the shape of my patch i used my clear ruler to experiment with different lines and in doing so i'm able to see what gaps need to be filled in order to square off my block to achieve a more square shape you can either find pieces to fit these gaps or you can also change how the edges on two different pieces will line up so i continue to work on these scrap patches by picking up pieces and sewing them together a lot of my fabric came in fat quarter bundles and i coordinated my scrap blocks in the same way however some blocks are also entirely random so that's what's so fun about improv quilting it's really free-flowing you can really get lost in it and so here i am just continually finding pieces to sew together using my ruler to play out different cuts and shapes after a lot of improvising over many days here's what remains of my pile of scraps and here are some of the patches i made with my scrap patches ready and my t-shirts lined it's now time to plan the layout so when i'm starting to lay things out i look for themes and groupings within the squares so for this t-shirt quilt there are two very obvious groupings there are t-shirts from a distinct time in my life from events and clubs and jobs and then there were cultural figures the beatles yoshi where the wild things are and so with these two categories in mind i began to lay out my t-shirt squares and used my scrap patches to help fill in any gaps so i worked on a few different layouts and the first one is a little bit out of proportion it's a bit too long and too skinny for me but it really helped me understand how much material i was working with so i knew i wanted to create a wider quilt so now i had my two categories to help guide me and an approximate size that i was aiming for even knowing this the layout phase still is a lot of trial and error it's a bit like a puzzle and involves experimenting with different combinations until your patches are fitting together well and looking nice too and so when i'm laying things out i'm thinking of a few things some t-shirts have a back and a front and so i want to keep those pairs close together i also want to avoid placing similarly colored blocks too close together so there are also some scrap patches that color coordinate with t-shirts and so i'm looking to put those together too i'm also looking for easy seams to sew so if t-shirts have the same height or width i'll tend to pair those together so i came to a layout that i was happy with but i needed to go back to my fabric stash and create some more scrap blocks to include because i didn't have many scraps left i made traditional blocks and i also made faux scraps going back to my stash and just cutting irregular pieces and shapes out of fabric and having this amount of control over such a creative process was also really fun so now that i have all of my pieces all of my t-shirts and my layout it's time to start stitching up the quilt front so i don't always have a full row or column of t-shirts to sew just because of the way that things are laid out so instead i will always sew blocks together in sections and then sew those sections together and so a few tips sometimes i find myself needing to tuck a section into a corner that's already created from two other sections and in these cases i don't sew to the edges and this leaves me enough seam allowance for my next piece if i'm concerned about creating a straight edge like when i want to preserve a graphic by ensuring it doesn't get sewn into a seam allowance or get trimmed off i use clips and a long straight edge to help me line things up and one final tip is that i should have put more effort into making this section a perfect rectangle because this little bit of overhang was tough to sew into the row above now i did leave space in the row above to accommodate but my seams didn't line up perfectly so i actually had to go and reduce the size of that scrap patch and then finish sewing the sections together by hand using something similar to an applique stitch and so here are all of my blocks and my patches sewn together and now it's time to address a major missing component a border to frame all of these t-shirts and scrap patches i use this dark purple fabric throughout my quilt patches and had enough of it to put a substantial 12 centimeter or five inch border around all sides of my quilt and after completing the border the top is looking pretty finished but i remind myself always at this stage that there's lots more sewing to do and the next step is to prepare the batting and the backing fabric and that starts with measuring the entire quilt top and cutting everything to size so for the back i'm going with a hundred percent cotton flannelette it's thicker than a quilting cotton but not as fuzzy as a flannel i need to sew two pieces together to make one piece that fits the top and to make the back look like one seamless piece i match the patterns on the back and then trim down the seam allowance i cut the back to be bigger leaving myself overhang on all sides of the quilt top i also cut the batting a cotton poly blend to be larger than the quilt top the reason i cut these second and third layers to be bigger is to account for the fact that my quilt top is not completely square or flat so as i work on it if i'm finding that my fabric is shifting and i need to smooth things out to the edges i'll still be able to keep all three layers together and lined up and i won't need to trim anything down so once the three layers are cut down to size i prep the quilt for quilting so quilting is the process where all three layers get sewn together and so to hold three layers together i use t-pins and safety pins for my quilts i topstitched in the ditch around all of my t-shirt blocks and scrap patches other quilts may have decorative free motion quilting applied and this can be done on a regular sewing machine with the feed dogs down or on a long arm i started quilting the seams running in the middle of my quilt first working from the middle out reduces any puckering in the quilts so if i have to smooth any fabric out to the edges i'll be able to do that without any seams getting in the way i generally like to alternate and stitch a couple of horizontal top stitches and then vertical top stitches just to secure the layers and prevent things from twisting but i'm always working on seams closest to the middle first and so i actually had to stop quilting to address some puckering that was caused because i skipped a seam and so i undid all of the top stitches smooth things out and then started on that seam that i missed and i just wanted to include this to mention that it can be frustrating absolutely when your momentum is stopped but it's always worth addressing the issues it'll make construction easier so after quilting the last step to finish the quilt is binding and so i have used binding of various widths but six centimeters or two and a quarter to two and a half inches is common i've made my own binding before and i've also purchased binding from the store in this case i'm making my own i use clips to hold the fold of this binding after ironing it because i find that satin binding doesn't hold its crease as well as a quilting cotton so i wanted to try machine binding this binding to both the front and back of the quilts up until this point i had only ever bound quilts by hand so i was interested in finding a faster way so i sewed the entire binding by machine both to the back and then the front before concluding that i did not like it at all i even used my machine's decorative stitch function to see if i could finish the bindings edge in a more pleasing way and although it was nicer it was still too messy for me so i don't know if it was the satin material or the foot that i used but the binding was not finished in the way that i wanted and so my darkest moment in this entire project came when i realized that i wasn't happy with the binding and knew that i was going to redo it and i know that redoing it was the right thing to do i know that i didn't wait years to finally remake this quilt only to be unhappy with the very last step unfortunately i didn't have any more black satin left but i did have this pink satin which is a lighter weight and so knowing that i was going to bind this pink binding by hand i lined up the raw edges of the binding to the raw edges of the front side of the quilt i stitched along the entire perimeter and then sat on the couch and finished the back side of the binding by hand and here it is all finished so i'll admit that having to redo the binding put me in a really sour mood and in the end i thought the pink was a nice pop of color but i wasn't really happy with the material choice and i had a problem with fraying technically speaking i didn't love the way that it turned out yeah so i was honestly expecting to feel a greater sense of joy when i finished this quilt i had just anticipated redoing it for so long and i had really wanted to fix a whole bunch of things so to be less than pleased with the binding and to have a struggle right at the end kind of put a damper on my mood it took me a little while though and i came to really appreciate my quilts and all of the work that i had put into it and i really just needed some time to sit with it and remind myself that all of the things that i wanted to address the size the borders the quality of fabric that i was using those were all things that i did fix so in the end i'm really really happy with my quilt and i'm also taking two sort of creative things away from this entire process one is that i really really enjoyed the entire process of quilt improvising and using my scrap patches and i'm really really excited to try that technique again and see if i can push myself to use that in other sort of creative ways and the last thing that's become super clear is that i need to really confront the challenges and the struggles that i have with planning and i really think that having a better plan is going to help me with my design and construction process and that's really going to be the difference between those finishing details that i'm looking for which is nice straight edges and square corners so knowing that i need to plan and knowing that this will kind of impact the end result of my quilt motivates me to really work on this and i do think that quilt improvising and that creative technique will be able to help me and so i'm really really happy to be finished this project i'm really really happy to have my quilt and the motivation or the inspiration that i feel to try my next quilt is also really really exciting so if you have watched to the end of this video i really really appreciate it and i thank you so much if you have made quilts before and you have any tips for me i would love to hear them and if you have repurposed any of your old clothes or old materials from your house into something else into another project for yourself i would also love to know about it thanks for watching", "i9owQ5gh168": "what's up guys my name is Dan McCready I'm here at twin cities in st. Paul Minnesota and today we're going to talk about cotton t-shirts if you've ever looked at t-shirts you'll probably notice that there are a ton of options in this video I'm gonna help you decipher what kind of t-shirt would be best for you by giving you a few details about each of our favorite cotton t-shirt the first t-shirt I'd like to talk about it's no frills it's your basic t-shirt it's the Gildan G 5000 this t-shirt is made out of standard cotton it's affordable it's got a boxier fit and it's got a ton of color options to choose from the next t-shirt is the Gildan soft style G 64,000 this shirts a little bit nicer than your G 5000 it's got a semis fitted feel to it so it's not as boxy shirt was made sure where it still has a ton of color options and it's a little bit softer and more durable because it's a ring spun cotton next we'll move up to the anvil 980 this t-shirt is also made by Gildan who owns anvil this shirt is a comb ring spun cotton t-shirt it's a sin I fit it as well it's very similar to the soft style but it's kind of in-between the soft styles and then the later shirts I'm going to talk about alright next I would like to talk about the next level 3600 this is definitely one of our most popular fashion fit t-shirts the next level uses the combed ring spun cotton so it's a very soft durable t-shirt this shirt is going to cost you a little bit more it's also got less color options and the other shirts we're going to talk about today next level they run a little small you definitely hugs me real a lot tighter than the other shirts so this shirt I would maybe consider going up a size another fashion fitted t-shirt that's very popular is the Bella canvas 3000 one one thing that's really nice about the Dahle canvas is although they are also manufactured overseas like all of the shirts were talking about today the dialogues where they actually dye the colors of the shirts are done here in one factory in California this helps them keep a very consistent color between all their t-shirts the Bella canvas is another fashion fitted tee they come out with all kinds of great colors all the time they're very soft it's a cone ring spun cotton or they call it an heirloom combed ring spun cotton and it's another great option if you're looking for a fashion fitted t-shirt and finally we'll talk about the American Apparel 2001 they got two options one of them is made overseas the other one is made here in America which will cost you extra with American Apparel you're paying for that brand name even though Gildan now owns american apparel american apparel is another fashion fitted teeth it's a combed ring spun cotton supersoft they've got a lot of color options so of course they're very nice shirts as well the point is there's a ton of different options to choose from so you've got to decide what's right for you it depends on your fit what kind of feel you're going for and of course your price point and if you're looking to

is pretty typical some of the numbers don't come through now the first thing to do usually won't solve it but the first thing to do is install fresh batteries in it which I have done that and as you can see that it's still not helpful if you play around with it when it's on you'll notice that if you press in certain areas sometimes on the screen I'll do it lightly it's made out of glass but you'll notice sometimes that they'll come back especially around the edges and I found this sweet spot here is there so you notice if I squeeze this just right there it is 10:58 perfect but if I of course release the pressure something is not connecting right and those numbers don't appear and you can kind of now if you had a really large clippers you could probably not have to take anything apart just put it here and find the right spot and be done with it but then you're gonna have Clippers hanging out so we're gonna take this apart and see what's causing that and if possible if there it's worth fixing so I've got my trusty jewelry screwdrivers with me and we're gonna set on taking this baby apart all right that's one oh boy these must have been the other a machine tightened or about Hulk they're so tight all right now of course this happens with cheap clocks expensive clocks you see this on watches to tend to cause issues where some of these numbers just for some reasons start not to show and we'll probably find out that it's something to do with a display contact the middle context are coming off but these are not necessarily meant to be user replaceable so you make sure there's nothing hiding there is a screw hiding underneath of there see if we can pop this up some of these companies like you put a couple extra they went out of their way to put as many as possible I guess that's good and I'm just check the battery compartment make sure they don't have any screws underneath there as well no they don't wonderful so quick shake about five screws out and hopefully the back will lift right up for the most part to reveal yes this is not all the way undone let's see here and we've got this panel here so I can't just pull it straight off so it's probably still sticking to it somehow yeah there we go all right let's see what we have here ah we may be in luck we'll see so we've got the battery compartment here we'll see how I can turn this this makes sense this is where we have the buttons for temperature humidity setting the time and most of that is fact all of the controllers going back to this bottom circuit board so we'll take a look at that in a moment and then we have this beeper here this is what was making that beep so you can set an alarm standard double-a batteries for a total of 3 volts and these are the hinges so let's take a look what we have on this side because this is where the problem is that so we've got a whole bunch of screws wow that is see if I can zoom in on that a little bit that is a ton of screws and that makes sense because I think on the other side is where those connections that we need to address are it's got a bunch of connections under here and it's actually quite interesting that's not me was it no look at that there's already kind of a scratch there and if the camera can pick it up look up these screws if I turn the sideways you're going to see something that I find quite interesting some of these are screwed in a lot tighter while these ones are looser and this one's pretty high so oh this is almost beveled in the sukkah was driven in with force got a little scratchy from it which makes me think it's someone manually did this it's not an automated system but then we have it again we have this one is positively different in terms of height and all the way screwed and then this one so this inconsistency of pressure most likely is causing some of this so sure at first it wasn't an issue but the contacts maybe it's starting to starting to Oh No the environment starting to make those contacts potentially rust or degrade in terms of connectivity and that's typically what happens with these clocks so all things will break down over time so we may get lucky be able to clean those contacts off and save this precious clock all right and if not then we learn something new and fun let's grab the rest of these so in case you're wondering always be careful with these types of circuit boards because these black things that are really evident here those are traces I they're pieces of flat wire that are connecting one thing to the other just the same as these guys are they're no different only this time that's on the circuit board if you accidentally scratch one of these and like it's cut straight through it you've severed that wire so just be a little careful all right so if we pull this one off let's see what this reveals all right all right we are gonna be in luck I'm really actually quite excited because my guess is we can fix this so the first thing we have is we have the actual sensor believe this is what's measuring the temperature that's a little-little thermistor so hopefully that's coming through nice and clear so we've got a nice thermistor there and we have a couple of diodes capacitors resistors supporting this I've got the main brains of the clock if you will here along with the crystal to set the hertz and cut more resistors so this pad here that you're seeing right now this is the pad that's relaying the right to right voltage to the display and as I mentioned these can experience corrosion from weathering from different environments if you're in the South probably quite familiar with things corroding and that's generally what happens these things start to cause issues see if we can get that to focus a little bit more I'll do that there we go so potentially some of this can be now the other part that can cause issue is of course how are these pads connecting to a display well it's got this guy right here and ever since I was a little kid I've always found these quite fascinating it's simple at its heart but I bet the manufacturing process it can be a little bit tricky and what I'm referring to is this beautiful let me see if I can pull this out actually maybe that would be even better hey there we go we've got the display out wonderful there's the display tada now this display runs by electricity so how do we connect metal pads right which are sending a voltage through these to the actual context I mean it's glass right well in between these panels you can see very lightly there are leads special conductive leads to these numbers and those leaves right small thin thin thin wires come all the way and touch one of these guys see that same width as you're gonna find on this back daughter board or mainboard however you want to address it so what's really neat is in between those two we have this this is a rubbery type of you know conductive device I'm not quite sure the name of it it's pretty neat though and it relays the contacts from the glass to the actual board so the board comes on and smashes it straight down on it if there is sufficient pressure not on even pressure those contacts I'm not sure if this is coming through those contacts press on here just so and conduct electricity so what can we do to improve this that's the tricky part I don't want to remove this from the glass because I'll probably cause issues with it I can put it back but it might be air pockets and might introduce dust and something's not contacting plus as you can see I may not get it perfectly aligned so what I'm going to do other than just to look at it from this video I'm gonna leave it alone because I suspect that if there's any gaps between the glass and this guy there's nothing much I can do I don't have that process to fix it or add a new one in I'm sure there's possible but I don't want to do that so what I will do though is I'm gonna gently put this back gently clean this off and then we're gonna clean the contacts on the other side apply a little power and then maybe we can add the pressure based on the screws so it's even I get her back all right so I'm gonna reassemble this display gently fit this in here there we go and now we have our display put together in this manner and then I'm gonna grab something I'm not sure what I can I'll grab some alcohol and cotton and gently wipe this up and then I will get some alcohol I don't have really anything abrasive but I'll get some alcohol to clean these up and then we'll apply some pressure and see if that does it for us so give me a moment to grab that and I've got my trusty cotton shirt make sure you don't use cotton swabs or anything of that nature because the cotton particles are so loose they'll just get lodged in here they could wrap on this and pull this rubber thing off and if you do that you might just want to lose it so I'm going to add just a dab of alcohol on this my fingers like this if you ever were in the military and you had to do shoe-shining none of that then you will understand how that is back to the old days and I will just lightly rub the alcohol on here in order to remove any debris any issues at all or any yeah mainly should just be the breeze but if the metal is tarnishing somewhat there might be a little bit of residue on here move that press it down a little bit being very careful not to dis okay and there you go and there's a little bit of dirt most likely coming from what I would think is ten on those contacts so this is done nothing else I can do about it now with this guy gonna do the same thing very very similar grab a new there we go smooth it out get some more isopropyl alcohol now I wouldn't suggest you don't use water because you need something that evaporates quite quickly and will just rub vigorously on these contacts to clean them off and if we've done it right I would suspect that they'll it might even look a little bit shinier all right be careful not to dislodge that crystal or break it all right all right wonderful so I don't see very much residue on here and you may not it seems very very clean this certainly looks nice and clean didn't really look dirty before but it's hard to tell so we've got these contacts nice and clean we didn't use any cotton that comes loose so we are set to put this back together hopefully we can apply even pressure and we're set now we're dealing with very low voltage here so there's no real concern and powering this up so we can do a quick test run and configure it so this clock is working and it's providing juice out here for the display so now we kind of get the display set up all right so being ever so gentle not to break these wires which is a lot easy to do set this here I'm going to marry this as it was and then there are other the camera can pick it up there are other guides so this is not just sitting just within the center of this post there's other guy it's one right here that pokes through and one that's on this and that pokes through see that to assure that this is being aligned properly it's not being skewed as we're lighting it so if we take a look at this very gently you can see sometimes you see something I'm gonna press on it a little bit oh you can't see anything all right so I'm gonna press on that a little bit and you'll see some numbers yeah there you go Sunday and I'll try and press evenly on everything and there we go we see the bottom and we see the top coming so let me get a couple of those installed and then we'll go through the configuration now I mentioned that these screws the way that they were installed was impressively tight and they seemed to not necessarily be the same height these are all the same ah they are not okay so we have two types of screws within this that's interesting we do have two types of screws so if you take a look real closely we have one that is beveled that's over here and then we have this guy here who is not beveled so see if I can figure out which one goes in which area I'm not quite sure hmm I did not pay attention I did not pay attention well I could rewind the video and look at the type of screws however I won't they all looked about the same I just don't tell anyone should be okay you know like this here and I will put start putting some on the other side so we don't warp the board as we are installing this screws then I'm gonna put one more and then we'll take a look and see what we see on the actual image beautiful nice and tight so let's see if we've repaired anything well well well now there is no one here when you power this up it starts at low 3 so let's go to the back press a couple of things how about there set okay let's do 24 hours I'll get that set just 24 so we should do the most illuminating okay 68 without me yeah what's going right through all those numbers fan 268 there's eight we'll just leave it there we'll leave it blinking okay so it appears that it's actually solved so we got to put more screws in because it may be a little bit finicky right temperature change comes about and all of a sudden little contacts don't work anymore right enough space so how to make sure we're putting all of these in and I'm not going to over tighten these but certainly they need to be tight because that board used to be snug against the glass and sandwiched in between that plastic that rubber strap to screw all right so let's put this one here and finally and make sure that snug well put the last one there and keep that snot so it is interesting why they have this design of the different screws it seems kind of bit unnecessary to have two different types of screws but there we are we have ourselves a nice nice clock cool so now we just need to put this back together now how did it go back together don't think I need anything else for that so we're gonna watch those wires and sandwich this end a little bit alright just seeing what screws have fell out I think only this ones that remaining can hear it making noise alright so let's put I'm going to just do a quick spot check so I'll put only about two screws and turn around make sure all the sudden decided to stop working and there we go yeah it's fantastic all right let me put the other ones in we'll run through the test and we're good to go so we saved well I saved but you may save one at home if you have one of these and you want to have a little fun saved ourselves I suppose I don't know 15 20 bucks it's pretty nice clock let's get one more of these these vents on the side are so that the temperature can more easily reach that thermistor that we sought to measure the temperature all right so we didn't lose any screws so we didn't make it any lighter but it is solid Lee belt all right so let's take a look and see what the temperature is reading because I'm not as familiar with Celsius 74 if I take a look at my Galileo says 75 perfect so we're really quite within spec let's run through our numbers all right wonderful oh it's like me when I'm running okay walking up the stairs haha all right so hit this fantastic I don't know 13 and it is a Thursday look at that it's set again what does that do us all right so let's it set one more time 24 is okay what's the time so it's military time now and it's 8 so it's 20 all right so it's set ready to go and this is awesome and I think the last thing that I'm going to do is I don't really use this alarm so there's an alarm function on the back of this that I will shut down all right so tried the batteries suspected it wasn't but want to make sure it's not something that simple and it turned out it was it took it apart clean the contacts truck did not remove that long rubber piece from the screen important not to do that but gently cleaned it off with rubbing alcohol and cotton shirt make sure you do not use a cotton swab the cotton will separate and it gets lodged and into the electronics and the rubber and it's hard to clean so you want to make sure you have something that's not going to so easily break apart like you're on a white undershirt and clean the contacts on the main board again being careful not to wound any circuits and then put it back together make sure we had good pressure on the board and we have ourselves a nice clock thanks for watching you", "MZrv1rhd1eM": "Hey guys it's Megan with BELLA+CANVAS in\nthis video we're gonna cover everything you need to know about fabrics whether\nyou're brand new to the industry or if you're an industry vet I'm sure you've\nwondered what the difference is between Heather CVC and tri-blend or what the\nheck slub or poly viscose means today we're gonna break it all down for you let's start with the basics\nthe most common tea in the printable market is 100% cotton a lot of other\nbrands out there use carton open-ended cotton this is your cheaper or heavier\nscratchier or price point t-shirt at bella canvas we use only 100% cotton ring\nspun cotton what this means is we take the raw cotton and we comb out the\nimpurities and then it's ring spun to create a long strand of yarn so that\nwhen we knit our fabric its a tight weave and it's the best surface to print on\nthis is our style 3000 one the singles are like a thread count the higher the\nsingle the finer the fabric in the industry singles range for about 18 all\nthe way up to 40 your carded open-end cheaper tees are going to be in that 18\nto 20 single range our 100% combed and ring spun cotton is a 30 single and it's\na 4.2 ounce so 3001 is your go to basic hundred percent comb and ring spun tee\nit's great for discharge printing and direct garment printing we're going to\nget into all the details with printing tips for all the different types of\nfabrications down the line to keep your eyes open for that video to come another\nsuper popular fabrication is Heather CVC our Heather CvC is at 52% combed and\nring-spun cotton 48 percent polyester blend it's a 30 single at 4.2 oz\nHeather CVC basically means and it's a poly-cotton blend and CVC stands for\ncheif value cotton which is a fabric term to indicate that there's a slightly\nhigher cotton content than polyester the incredible market is trending towards\nHeather CVC because that polyester blend gives it that nice texture that nice\nsubtle dimension and the polyester blended with the cotton gives it a\nreally nice soft hand so you have other hundred percent cotton that's more of\nyour price point basic and then Heather CVC is a step up when it comes to\npricing now we're going to take a look at tri-blend tri blend is a unique blend of\ncotton polyester and rayon so you have the comfort of the cotton you have the\ndurability of the polyester and you have the drape from the rayon rayon was\noriginally developed as a substitute for silk that's what gives it it's super\nsoft hand with our tri-blend we have a 40 single and we're the only ones to do\na 40 single in the market I realize I'm bias that we have the best tri-blend in\nthe industry similar to Heather CVC tri ones also have that nice subtle texture\nand the reason for this is that the natural and the synthetic fiber\ntake the dye differently so that when it's knit you have that really nice heather\nlook one thing that's unique about bella canvas tri-blend is that we've also\nengineered our dyeing process so that the natural fibers and the synthetic\nfibers will take the color in a way that results in a solid tri-blend we're the\nonly ones in the industry to offer a solid tri-blend so you get that same\ngreat hand that silky drape but that solid color that sells so well in the\nindustry slub is more of a specialty fabrication\nthat you might not be as familiar with slub is basically the leftover fibers\nand it's a cotton poly rayon blend that's knit in a way that gives it this\nnice tonal texture so when you're screen-printing you get that dimension\nbut it's tonal so that it's approachable from a decoration standpoint people are\nreally into slub because it's something you see prevalent at retail right now\nand it's got that great vintage look to it if you're familiar with Bella\ncanvas you're probably familiar with flowy but you might not know what that\nnecessarily means the flowy collection is made of our poly viscose fabric it's\n65% polyester 35% viscose it's a 30 single and it's is 3.7 oz what's unique\nabout this it's got a really soft silky and it's an elevated fabrication that\nyou would find at retail for women's apparel\nit also drapes away from the body so it's slightly oversized so no matter\nwhat shape or size you are you're gonna find something in the flowy collection\nthat's right for you for the past seven years flowy has only been available to\nwomen but we recently added a poly viscose unisex tee to our fast fashion\ncollection and that's awesome for those sublimation printers out there because\nit's perfect for that type of printing last but not least we have our\nmarble fabrication marble is another one of our signature textures that gives you\nthat great dimension but it's awesome for graphic tees it's 91 percent\npolyester nine percent combed and ring spun cotton it's a 30 single and a 4\nounce so it's got a really nice soft tan to it and again that great texture a lot\nof other brands in the industry have Heather CVC and tri blend options for\nyou but no one else does dimension like this now you should all be fabric\nexperts but if you still have questions leave them for us in the comment section\nbelow it would have been too much to cover printing tips and the difference\nbetween all the fabrics so keep an eye out for our new video that will cover\nall of the different techniques for these fabrics right here Be Different", "ZV8VouSkfjE": "[Music] [Applause] YouTube family welcome back it's your first time here my name is Devin on deck I discuss fashion and tech here and today we're talking about or rather on a journey to discover the perfect black t-shirt now if you already know this channel you know my favorite color to wear is black especially when it comes to my basics and over the years I have tried the hell of different t-shirts and I feel like I'm getting really close to find the perfect one but I would love your help in deciding so in this video I have six different teams from my closet from my drawer he's all been washed and dried from $5 all the way up to 95 I'm gonna try them on for you we're gonna go over talked about fit weight how things feel and the quality points and then hopefully by the end of the video we have a verdict [Music] now first up we have the unique little dry package teeth this is gonna cost you about five or six us and it was my favorite shirt up until recently now starting with the good things the price point is good the weight is great it's kind of like a poly-cotton blend so if you're really hot and run hot like I do when you sweat it dries up really quickly but for some reason recently they've been getting a little sloppy with the sizing like this is supposed to be a large on me and usually again I've been buying these charts for years but for some reason this one fits like a medium and a half like when I first put it on it was a tiny bit sluggish but it was fine but after watching and drying it it shrunk up on me so you see it's too short the sleeves are hella tight right now and it just doesn't fit me comfortably so I haven't really worn this shirt in a while but it used to be that you can wash and dry this and then fit fine so I don't know what's going on with these but they definitely are being replaced coincidentally by another shirt within the same company and that leads me to our next t-shirt the UT from Uniqlo it's gonna cost you about $10 USD but it's a total upgrade from the t-shirt from before the weight is amazing I love how this shirt feels when you have an on is very substantial you can tell a huge jump in quality from the dry package one from the previous shirt - this one right here the banded collar right there on the tee is a great touch you just like a fold over piece of fabric that makes a world of a difference as far as the collar goes it's nice and tight but not too tight and the only feedback I have is that the sleeves are a little bit loosey okay even when I cuff them there's still a little loose for me but I think this is a good trade-off to have a way heavier tee way more substantial tee and I would also say it's a little long ish but again not a big deal for me this is a great shirt everything's being consistent so far I've been buying these for the last few months and all the sizes are consistent and it stays black for a long time with the color fastness is really strong so thumbs up on this t-shirt I'm liking it so far now moving on up the price here we have this texture t-shirt by Zara now this is gonna be something you'll find here throughout the year they have different ones all the time and they'll run you around like 30 bucks and I love these t-shirts because they almost add a sophistication to your outfit so if you do want to wear a t-shirt but you want the same appeals like having a thin sweater or something a little bit more refined on then throw one of these on it's gonna look perfect and a little bit more dressy winter time I put an overcoat over it and it looks great or the spring summer when it's too hot for a jacket I can throw that on with like a pair of chinos or some slacks and like some minimal sneakers and have a great smart casual look that again it's a little bit more sophisticated than a regular t-shirt now I would say right now after watching like it's barely long enough before I actually watched you like the first where they fit perfectly bend is shrinking a little bit after washing and hang drying it but the sleeves are the great lip you don't have to really roll them but also it's a great t-shirt off the rack I suggest you look into them if you want something a little bit more elevated now this next t-shirt is in the premium category and it's by a brand called a sketch this is gonna cost you about 45 bucks but in my opinion for a premium t-shirt it is worth the price one of the first great things about a sket is you can pick a various sizing when you pick your size meaning that when I got a large I can pick a short a regular or along it since I am 6 1 then I have a long one and it fits me great now the sleeves are a little bit longer than I would like but I'm already asleep rolling guys so that's fine when you roll them they fit perfectly as far as like looseness and width around my arms it's great and if you look at the neckline I have that same overlapping hem similar to the Uniqlo you t-shirt but it's a little bit thinner and again it makes a shirt feel a little bit more substantial and elevates it in my opinion the fabric weight itself is kind of uh I would say medium heavy kind of a medium and a half as far as weight not super heavy and thick like I would like it like the Uniqlo $10 you shirt but it is very substantial and it does feel like a premium t-shirt so when you spend 45 bucks us on it you don't feel like you spin it much money so I will at least try one of these if you have Tim t-shirts in your closet maybe these are like two or three of them but I do recommend that this would be a good staple to have now as you move up the price tiers in the premium category we have a brand called Vince with your t-shirt coming in at $95 and the reason why I put premium in quotes is because the only thing premium about this is the price point this is a regular shirt it doesn't fit any different from any other insurance this list the weight is similar to the five dollar Uniqlo one it's like kind of a light medium ish weight so it feels a little I don't know not ninety five dollars it's kind of faded now and it's more of a gym shirt it's not really special everything else on this list right now I recommend way more than this t-shirt so now that we're double all the expensive shirts you're moving on to the very last one that I really believe belongs in a category all of this home it's from a company called lot it's more of a like a subscription service what I love about the subscription services you not only give me clothing you're getting accessories you're getting self-care items and everything is black black tees black crude names black pants black shoes and even black tutu brushes but as far as this t-shirt goes one of the best things about it that I love that is personalized with my name on it look at this it's a beautiful thing and the quality of the t-shirt is also very awesome I would say the weight of this t-shirt is probably the same as a premium weight from the skin team and I will say the only thing that I don't like about these is that I get it only once every other one instead of every month because I really love these t-shirts I wish I got I can give more I can get them in bulk but I just can't only can get one every other month but as far as thing and everything it's very comfortable I'm a big fan of it so I had to put it in this video but I would love to know from you what do you feel like is the best one on this list I would love to have been asked it cut but in the Uniqlo UT weight I love the heavy team but I would like a less Lucifer arm and more customizable

"D8DahUYbK4Q": "[Music] hi guys today I'm doing something much different than I've ever done before I really want to review something very basic and compare it with all different brands I've got a whole bunch of white teas for you guys today they are all crewnecks they are all 100% cotton they're all different price ranges so one of them is like 15 bucks the last one is almost $200 and I want to see if it's actually worth spending that kind of money on such a basic white tea for the record I don't plan on keeping all of them some of them still have their tags attached and that's just a chance for me to be able to keep the ones that are the most distinct from the pack and anything else that I feel is a little maybe subpar I will be returning and none of this is sponsored or gifted everything is something that I purchased myself so I will leave everything linked down in the description below that will list my sizes that I bought as well as my own measurements of my body so you can kind of compare and make a judgement on which size that you would get the first one is from made well this one's 15 bucks on sale right now I have to say it is very similar to a more expensive one that I have in a few minutes so keep watching what I want to talk about with this one is that the fit is really beautiful I like the fact that the shoulder is a drop shoulder which means that the sleeve isn't very long but it looks longer on me that's a preference of mine I like for my sleeves to be a little bit longer I also think that this shirt this fabric is very much more on the see-through side of things it's less opaque so it looks more like you would see a white bra through it so I think that that's another preference if you like to have your shirts be maybe more breathable and you don't mind if your bra shows a little bit then this would be a good option I like all sorts of tees I like really thick ones I like thin ones it just depends on the outfit of course with $15 you're not getting as much as you could be with things like ethical standards some other companies that I want to feature today are you know five stars on that realm but this one is just made well so they're making strides on fair trade but really just in their denim Department so far another factor to the fact that it's a see-through shirt it's a very thin material this shirt wouldn't last for you know several years like some of them will that's also something to keep into consideration maybe you aren't looking to invest in a white tee because the t-shirt will become stained over time especially if it's a thin material this next one is from ever Lane it runs 18 dollars right now it again is a very thin material but it's not as thin as the made well one was the fit of it I think is a dream I like the fact that it has like more of a longer sleeve but it's not incredibly long I also like the fact that the sleeves are a little bit tighter and that's just again everything dimension here is preference so judge for yourself on what you like if you like things to have a tighter sleeve or a sleeve that's up higher I prefer them to be longer no matter really how wide they are but I like the look of this one I think because the sleeves are tighter compared to the body that's a really flattering look when I was comparing the feel of each one of these shirts this one was one of the highest-ranked ones on how comfy it is it's very soft it's that pima cotton that makes it so soft there's nothing like that you know it compared to a regular regular cotton of any form this one is so super soft as far as durability like how long it will last I don't think that it will last like a month I think it'll last much longer than that but I don't think it'll last for a couple years just because it's a thinner material and that already will make it more prone to stains and rips and that type of thing I've had plenty of ever lain shirts that are made of this pima cotton material and I find that like my turtlenecks especially they will last about a year and when you think of a turtleneck you're wearing it through several seasons and same with a t-shirt you're gonna wear that spring summer fall at least so those are things to consider I would say that this is a really fair price considered all that I've read about with the good trade they've shown a lot about whatever lanes ethics are and I can link that again down below next is alternative apparel and this one runs about twenty four dollars it's a much thinner material just like the other ones were but this one has a very loose fit so this one's a small on me and I would say that the sleeves have the biggest difference there a shorter sleeve not my preference not my thing it's almost the way that a cap sleeve looks you know when it's just up and angled a little bit more so this one is not really one that I prefer the fit of myself the really redeeming qualities about it is that I think that it's the most comfortable thing it's not the most comfortable out of this pack but this one is right up there with the best of them and I will say too that this one is much more on the you know ethical and sustainable route if you want to go that route then this one would be an option for you to look into this one I'm quite shocked about so this is j.crew it's about 30 bucks I would say that it is so incredibly similar to the made well one the first one but you know what's so interesting is the fit is a little bit different the sleeves don't have that you know you don't have that drop shoulder that's making the sleeves look more flattering I really don't care for the fit of this one at all and I was looking closely and it's already starting to have a hole in it and all I've done is put it on a hanger and wear it around just for this video and it still has the tag on it like I haven't worn this out at all it's an extra extra small it's got that same fabric from made while so it's thinner but I have to say that I think it's just the way that made well has created there's I don't know exactly what they've done but this one is so much more fragile than that one is and the fit of it again not my favorite this is me not that like I made that feel both of these shirts he thinks they feel exactly the same but to me this one just feels just a little bit scratchy err in this case I'm just really surprised because this one is backward I think through July or any for months not only that but it's a best-seller I'm just kind of shocked at this one it's much different than what I would assume it's you know double the price of the made well one if you are torn between the made well and the j.crew one because they are so similar a hundred percent I would say go with the cheaper the made well one before reviewing the tape on all of these I thought this next one was going to be my absolute favorite and I haven't ruled that out yet but I have to say the feel of this one is just like heaven it is so dreamy and comfortable and soft it's so much softer than any of the other ones and so this one is from Quiana it runs about $45 the sleeves on it are very interesting because they are cuffed and they're sewn to be cuffed so you can't uncuffed them unless you take a little you know ditch remover and get that off but I love the look of this it's beautiful you know when you're thinking of the complete opposite and you buy a pack o t-shirts you know in a Hanes bag you wouldn't get something like this like this looks like something hanging up in a really nice shop so that's what I appreciate about this it's very extremely drapey and loose again I'm such a fan of longer sleeves so that one's hitting that box forming it's not extremely long but it's somewhere in the middle it almost has a shine on me too and when I was wearing it's acts like you know that has like a sheen to it and I found that to be really interesting a note about their ethics they're more of a slow fashion brand they're very fair trade and I actually even though it's a thinner shirt I don't think it's gonna fall apart very quickly it's very tightly knit and I think that that will give it a little bit more life to it but I do think that it could stain kind of easily next is redone and this one runs about $78 about a year ago Rhydian gave me a shirt and it was the exact same one it just I wore it to death and so I wanted to buy a new one myself and put it in with this list and just kind of compare it and hold it up against the others so one thing to note is that similarly to the made well in Jake it's got this sort of pattern to it if you look closely it's it's not an even pattern it almost looks like it's this heather color you know the way that it's knit together it's significantly different than the made while j.crew option it seems softer and yet heavier it has detail and the way that they knit this together in the back or sewed it together it looks like it's going to stand up the test of time much longer than some other options I just love the look of how vintage this looks it's just so inspired by that and I feel like I just have a different look about me when I'm wearing this shirt I also think it's great that they're using recycled or upcycle materials which redone is just known for I do think that there is just a couple of other shirts in this pack that I prefer more than this one I will say that this one is a dream it's durable it's got up cycled products that is using fabrics but then also just the fit of it it's gorgeous I would say that probably the way that how long it lasted me the last time was about a year but that was when it started to fade and I wanted something that was just bright white that I could compare against these and honestly I could still return this one and still keep going with my old one just kind of judge that for yourself how heavily you'd use this but I am really incredibly happy with this one this last one is somewhere in between really really expensive and affordable and I know that that's different for everybody but what I mean is it's luxury definitely it's not Chanel expensive but it's not you know much more affordable like the $15 option so this is Jesse kam and it runs about 195 dollars there are some really redeeming qualities about it where I am very tempted to keep it so I will just review those with you first of all it's more of an antique white it's not like a starch crisp clean white and I think that that will make it last a little bit longer because I don't have to try to maintain that brightness if you look closely the stitching on it is a very starch clean bright white which i think is a really unique detail to it then they put extra detail around here where it's like double stitched and the material is extremely thick it is so incredibly thick that I would say that you could definitely wear it in like spring and fall or you know if you're indoors but if you're gonna wear this outside in ninety hundred degrees you'd get pretty warm which might make you sweat and maybe stain the shirt so just kind of think about that but reviewing the tape I would say that this I was just blown away at how different this shirt was cut to make it look on me versus the other shirts the other shirts look more standard you know and that's what you get for what you pay when you wear something like this I was really surprised to see how much different I felt like it looked on me because I wasn't expecting that much of a difference for a basic white tee which is why I wanted I was like curious and wanting to try this example and I do love how long the sleeves are that's like automatically I'm gonna fall in love with anything that has that it's got a really wide cuff on the sleeves and I feel like that's another win like it looks really flattering there and then I because it's such a thick shirt and it's just made with such detail and quality and extra stitching everywhere this shirt is not going to disappear in a few months like some of the more like see-through or cheaper options are going to only last maybe you know a season whereas this one's going to last I could see if you took care of it maybe Scotch guarded at first it would last me you know a couple years at least maybe three years so you are paying for that and if you're more trying to buy less and just like consume less then something like this would be a good option because you're gonna have it forever you know as far as white tees are concerned and there's such a staple that I could see that that would be a really great benefit so Jesse Kim is more small business I think she has like three employees it's made locally in and those are reasons where it goes more into the cost of what you're paying for so look into all of that judge for yourself and just see where each one of these companies aligns with where your values are in those realms but this shirt overall it's five stars on how long it will last the fit of it I am absolutely in love with very tempted to keep it the feel of it I would say is the only thing holding me back from skipping it like five stars because it isn't super soft but I love the feeling of having a thick shirt sometimes you know so going into the ones that I'll be like keeping and returning I love love the Quiana one that one is my favorite I think that it's just such a great price range and I also think that the fit and the feel we're absolutely amazing so I definitely want to keep that one I'm also very tempted with the Jesse cam one even though it's much higher price I could see in the footage the difference of how it's cut compared to any of the others where I feel like okay it's a designer shirt like this one has reason for the price because it's just such a beautifully designed shirt and then the quality of it is right up there so no disappointments there I just you know maybe with time it will get even a little bit softer I wish that was just a little bit softer if it was it would have been my favorite out of the affordable options definitely the ever lane one was my favorite $18.00 and you get an incredible shirt and it's just beautifully cut the the design of it was flattering it's very light weight and it's something that I could wear every single day as for the ones I'll definitely be returning the alternative apparel one just really didn't amaze me enough to keep it just the way that it fit really was a little bit awkward to me and so it's just really not my preference I do think that their ethics are just amazing what it stands for so those are qualities that you might want to invest in and make up your own mind on that my least favorite in the one I'll definitely be returning was the j.crew option I just don't think that it was a good fit I feel like it was poorly put together it was double the price of the made while option and it's you know same company everything so I would rather just go with a maid well one if I was choosing between them I think that the maid well one had a much better sleeve length as far as having that drop shoulder and this one just doesn't have that so definitely not a fan of this one and that's it hopefully you found a shirt that meets exactly what you love maybe there's a certain fit you love or a brand or you know that it's standards behind it or maybe it's just a price point thing for you and all of those things are something to judge for yourself but I definitely have my winners and losers in this pack for my own personal taste and hopefully it just gives you guys insight if you like this sort of video then let me know because I could definitely do this more frequently with different types like maybe jeans or shoes or there's just so many options

[Music]", "LFyRo7ycDxU": "Hey guys I'm Summer from Bella + Canvas\nand we've spent years educating customers on the different types of cotton. Do you know\nthe difference between carded open-end ring-spun and heirloom combed and ring-spun?\nIf not in this video will be extremely useful for you. We're gonna compare how a\nscreen print and DTG print perform on these three types of cotton. Cole from\nShirt Agency is gonna show us how these different types of cotton print\nbut before we get started we just want to explain the differences in these\nqualities of cotton. So first you have your card at open end, your card at open\nend is your cheap scratchy heavier t-shirt? Yeah and then from there a lot\nof our retail customers have moved on to ring-spun because it has a much smoother\nsurface. And the next step up from ring spun is your heirloom combed and ring\nspun. And with ring-spun you can comb out one percent and still call it combed and\nring spun. But we actually comb out about 25 percent of the cotton that we start\nwith because it contains impurities that we don't want in that finished product.\nAnd we also only use long staple cotton which has a huge effect on the final\nresult so you end up with the smoothest printing surface possible. Yeah we\nabsolutely love printing on your guy's garments we get a really nice hand and\nfeel and our prints are really sharp. Today we're gonna show the comparison on\nthese three types of cotton that we talked about with a DTG print a plastisol print and discharge print so let's go see the results. So we have our\nplastisol prints hot off the press what are we looking at here? Well the\nmain thing good check out is on the carded open end when you look through\nthe loop you can see all the different fibers affecting the texture of the last\nscreen printing. And then obviously when you touch it with your hand it's got a\nrougher finish. Yeah you can definitely see some of the red fibers coming\nthrough mm-hmm. And moving on to the ring-spun one it is a little bit better but\nit's not necessarily like the best it could be. There's a little bit of\nfibrillation still happening and that's causing a little bit of a hand feel. And\nwhen you move on to the heirloom it's basically just a completely sharp\nfinished surface and on your hand it feels extremely smooth. So next we'll\nlook at our discharge print how does discharge differ from plastisol?\nSo with discharge instead of putting the ink on top like plastisol. We're\nactually removing the dye from the garment. So this to be honest isn't so\nmuch about the fibers anymore. This is about the quality of the dye and the\nquality of the base garment. So you can see with the heirloom we got a pretty\nclean sharp result with the discharge and then moving on to the ring-spun it's\na pretty similar result but we got a little bit more of the blue staying\nthrough it doesn't look like the true discharge. And then carded open-end\nnormally means that it's like a cheap shirt so we got a really nasty color on\nthis one which was a bit of a surprise. And I think that comes down to the\nquality of the dyes that they're using. Yeah how you dye the shirts is just as\nimportant as how you knit the shirt. So at bella canvas we dye everything in LA so\nwe can main that level of consistency and basically match all of our colors so\nyou have this quality when you have your discharge print. Alright and the third\nprint we did was a DTG or a direct to garment print. So what do you want to\nlook for in a shirt when DTG printing? Well the problem with direct to garment\nfor us pretty much all the time is with brightness. And so we had a pretty great\nresult with the heirloom cotton compared to the carded open-end. I think a lot of\nthat has to do with the tightness of the weave and the ink kind of falling into\nthe fabric. So with DTG it's more important than the other types of screen\nprinting to have a super tight knit weave since the ink lays on top of the\nfabric. Yeah and you already have such a high ink cost what DTG that your product\ncan't be sold for very cheap. And since you're not gonna be doing promo with DTG\nI would think that it makes sense to almost exclusively use a nicer ring spun\nor airlume t-shirt. Hope you guys enjoyed this video.

t-shirt plane t-shirt help desk what's up guys gary is in a make sure you go down and click on that subscribe button and click that notification bell and if you're watching on instagram or facebook follow us so you'll be notified of all this fantastic information we have on the t-shirt industry now i know a lot of you guys are dead set you know exactly what t-shirt company you're gonna use to get your blanks from and some of you guys are undecided and this is why this video is being made and for some of you guys who are dead set you might see something that may uh change your mind now in this video we're going to be focusing on three main key points when it comes to a t-shirt blank fit feel and price now we're going to be covering quite a few t-shirts in this video so it may be a little lengthy so i took some time and created time stamps for each brand and that's going to be down in the description box okay so something piques your interest you can go right directly to that brand but i strongly suggest that you watch this video in its entirety so enough with all this talking without any further ado roll that beautiful bean footage here we go okay guys this is the ideal by next level you can see all the style number information down in the left corner this is what it fits like on the model we're just gonna lay it out and we're gonna give it the old uh feel test and it feels nice uh it's mediocre it's not the softest and it's not the scratches so it's like kind of right in the middle and it has that uh rip away label which is always good and it says ideal and not next level i don't know why and this is what it looks like uh from the back now the price is 366. and please note you probably can get these cheaper if you go direct to the manufacturer so here we are anvil and as you can see the fit is nice it's a standard fits a little bit more athletic but just slightly boxy but nice the feel is very nice i would say um out of five i would give it like a four uh uh three and a half three point five out of five you know somewhat soft you know and slightly above average all right it has that rip away tag so you can do your branding okay very nice um and here is the back this is the back uh how it looks okay really nice and the price is 326 okay of course you might get it a little bit cheaper now price in general something you want to take into consideration if it's a bottom of the barrel t-shirt um then you want to get a t-shirt that's less expensive so you can even in that lower price you can have some room to make a profit and if you're selling a more premium t-shirt then you want to get a better quality blank to justify selling your t-shirt at a higher price and of course that blank is going to be a little bit more expensive but hey higher price more profit which means you can afford the more expensive blank let's go to the next one okay so this is jerseys okay we all know jerseys all right and it's a slightly thicker slightly thicker shirt so we're gonna spread this bad boy out and you're gonna see that it's nice you just saw the fit it's a nice fit it's um not too boxy not too athletic you know not too fitted nice shirt and a feel it's good it's it's a good middle of the road shirt you understand what i'm saying no complaints and you can see right here that there's no um side seam which is usually um the more athletic um shirts will have a side seam and right here you see that that is that rip away tag which is always a good sign for a blank all right now the field is the middle of the road it's middle of the road about a three out of a five and the price is 431 which is a little a little high and this is how it looks from the back that's jerseys fit all right guys fit this is so very important because depending on your demographic meaning your core target audience meaning the people who you are pushing your t-shirt company to they may want a different fit you may have a young hip demographic they may want a smaller tighter fit you may have a older demographic all right they may want a little bit of a boxier fit you may have an athletic demographic or you may be one of these people that's out here doing a line for people who are bodybuilders or crossfit or something like that then in that case you may want a more fitted tighter uh smaller waist v taper type fit for your t-shirts everything has to do with your core target audience and not all t-shirts are the same alright so fit is so very important all right and this is the hanes tagless shirt um and this one is the epitome to me in my opinion it's a dad's shirt it's a shirt that you just kinda it's just a shirt that you just kind of wear it's really not for screen printing you can see um it's really big and boxy all right and it's very thick a lot of you guys think that thick is a higher quality and not necessarily all right the feel is it's okay it's it's a mediocre and there's no um there's no side seam all right it's very hand feel it's very mediocre not too soft not rough though not rough and this is really important right here the the back neck tag is already heat pressed so you can't brand it so not a good look and um this is how it looks from the back you can see it's very big and boxy so um not for me my opinion not the best for starting a t-shirt business for obvious reason but it does have a pretty good price 279 and you probably could get it cheaper guys the tag the tag is so very important there was a time when hey whatever the brand of the t-shirt was they left their tag in and there was a time when you literally had to pay screen printers to cut the tag out so you could put your branding in it that's not the case anymore they make these t-shirts with mostly rip away tags so you can rip that tag out and put your own branding in there so i always want to call out what type of tag hopefully a rip away is in your blank tee also guys when you doing all the branding and you have your neck label and your hang tags and your boxes and everything matches guys that stuff looks so professional such a what's called perceived value you take your t-shirt line to a whole nother level baby all right guys alternative apparel very nice shirt first thing you're gonna see you're gonna notice that it is a little bit more fitted okay so a very nice fitting shirt all right let's lay it out and let's give it an initial just a field test and it it's very soft guys very soft very nice shirt okay uh you can get in there touch on that feels really good all right and also you're gonna see that it is a you can see that side seam right there which helps with the fit so we're already having some uh some premium things going on you can see that fit you know a little bit a little bit more tapered and fit it to the body and it has that rip away tag so this one is definitely a little bit more on the primo side all right and the price is about 385 okay um and of course you may be able to get a little bit cheaper at the actual website but alternative apparel really nice shirt all right guys this is the hanes nano tee this one totally came out of left field for me uh different than the haines tagless tee all right really nice fit and the fabric is really soft uh dynamite tee all right the fit is not quite um the super fitted but it fit really nice and you're gonna see right here that it has a really nice feel okay now right here you're gonna see that it does not have the side seam okay but it still managed to have a great fit and i think that has to do with the fabric it's a really light soft fabric so this nano t uh surprised me and uh you can see that it also has that rip away tag all right so um really nice and once again the feel was a really nice you almost can see how soft it is right surprise me right because i never heard of the nano t this is it from the back and the price is three dollars and eleven cent once again you might can get it cheaper from haynes uh themselves so that is the haines nano t okay so here we are fruit of the loom now this one kind of surprised me a little bit i thought it was going to be really bad and it wasn't the fabric is actually a nice feel not the best not the worst it's a light it's a light t-shirt guys it's a nice light t-shirt and it gets the job done if you want to just put something out there throw a screen print on it uh for the loom and of course it has the rip away tag all right which any good t-shirt should have and it was nice it felt good has a decent fit and i was presently surprised this is it from the back and the price was 3.49 i thought it could have been a little cheaper but hey you know i got it from a reseller so if you buy directly from fruit of the loom you may can get it cheaper all right on to the next one gildan or gildan all right this one is popular this is usually the shirt that you see that's the lowest price when you're choosing t-shirts on print on demand and there's a reason for that that's because the fabric is not very soft all right it's not nice it's not that nice feeling at all i mean it's okay after a couple of washes but initially um not the best feeling and that's why it's uh the least expensive um but it's a cool tee no side seam and the fit is it's okay um it's not boxy and it's it's not tapered or or like really fitted um fabric [Music] not the best feeling man not the best best feeling but it does have a rip away tag which is always good uh let's take a look at it from the back um cool t-shirt but um i would say low on lower on the quality scale and the price 279 so you can see it's a little bit less and you know hey you get what you pay for guys all right gildan next level check this one out now great thing about next level is look at the fit really great fit nice fitted to the body great i mean you can see it on the mannequin here so let's lay it out and um first you know we're going to give it a nice little feel and um it feels great it's really soft really nice all right it's um definitely a higher quality shirt and also you're gonna see right here that it too has a side seam okay which is a um telltale sign of a higher quality shirt and the rip away tag here it is from the back the price of 439 so uh it's a little bit it's it's up there all right it's up there but it is a higher quality more premium t-shirt next level bella canvas good old bella canvas you've heard about them several times here at t-shirt help desk great t-shirt really light airy soft fantastic t-shirt with a great fit alright and let's take a look as you guys should know bella canvas also has the side seam okay which gives it a really nice fit it's light it's not a heavy fabric and it's really really soft and of course it has the rip away tag and as stated previously bella is one of the softest on the market all right right up there with next level and in alternative apparel here it is from the back and the price 439 but that's from a middleman you can get it from bella canvas as most of these for about a dollar to 80 90 cents cheaper bella canvas next american apparel yes they are still around okay um they are really soft t-shirts really nice all right and just to let you know this t-shirt all the other ones were largest this one is a medium so if it seems extra snug that's because it is one size down okay but it does have a really good fit all right and it has that side seam okay so it is a more premium shirt with a nice fit okay this is it from the side you can see that it is a good slim fit all right and it yes has the rip away tag so great to brand with this is it from the back all right the price 392 all right so it's more on the premium side but a little bit less and like all the other ones if you go straight to the manufacturer you can get it for less all right guys as you can see all of the t-shirts are 100 cotton i didn't want to get into anything crazy i didn't want to get into the tri-blends or anything fancy schmancy like that that's gonna be for another video i wanted to keep it basic 100 cotton t-shirts but there is one exception i am going to show you guys one 100 polyester tee this is a great t-shirt for any of you guys who are doing active who are doing sports people who are working out golf anything where people may be working out and get sweaty because 100 polyester is a natural wicking fabric meaning that if you're sweating it naturally will kind of wick that sweat away and another thing about 100 polyester tees is that they are great for sublimation in fact really it's the only thing you really can use for sublimation all right so if you want to sublimate small and if you want to do those big all over sublimation tees you need a 100 or at least a very high polyester content but one little thing if you're doing sublimation this shirt has to be a light color preferably white all right so let me show you this is the jerseys dry power sport t-shirt great shirt and it feels like a regular t-shirt that's what's so great about it alright so this is it and it feels very similar to a standard jersey t-shirt if you didn't know the difference you probably couldn't tell and it is soft not the softest but it is a soft t-shirt in the back it doesn't have the rip away tag okay so um branding is gonna be a little bit tricky but um the price is also a little bit uh more 563 this is it from the back but if you want to do that athletic stuff this is the way to go that was a lot of t-shirts guys they were in no particular order i really wasn't trying to critique like that i just wanted to present them to you so you can make your decision on what's going to be in your t-shirt line now when it comes to actually purchasing these t-shirts you can go to each brand's respective website but please note a lot of these companies are going to require you to have a wholesale or a retail license they may want to see your website all right so you know you may have to do that but you're gonna get the absolute best prices now if you don't have that no worries you can go to places like jiffyshirts.com which is where i got all of these shirts okay they have you covered you don't need any of that stuff you can just go you can buy as little or as many as you like so anyway guys that's all i got for you today i'm gonna put some butt on my shoes and slide on out the dope cheers to your t-shirts start a t-shirt business or die trying and do something good for somebody and if you don't have anyone to do something good for do something good for yourself god bless and peace shirt man shirt man

it I didn't do anything to it I just uploaded it some go here to push customize like I said own thing only step I'm missing is when you go to basically upload and you go into your files and define your own SVG or PNG whatever you want to use and I have another video on that also how to upload PNG is how to change your colors SVG's and videos are all that so I'm not gonna go below okay I have this beautiful woman right here I love her I love her and you reach my chose reason why I purchased this SVG is because of the colors except the mission it's all about the colors to me well it's also because sublimation when you really can't feel it and your shirt so I love that because if I know you can feel it but something mission you can't feel it so I really love some elimination because of two things you can't feeling on your shirt you don't feel like anything else and then plus the colors are so vibrant so when I seen this on Coco twin attack comics I have I gotta have her I gotta have her the colors are vibrant they're pretty this colorful and I've been doing lot of sublimation not my civilization being really like black and white and a few colors I want to show my colors out on my cell emission printer that's why I purchased I'm gonna put her on everything I'm gonna do this shirt today I'm gonna do another video of me putting her on a mug yeah she's gonna be on everything I'm thinking about putting her in the bag too she's beautiful I love the colors I need to find more color more images with colors like this they have a lot of cartoon colors a lot of cartoon characters with a lot of colors but I love to find my african-american women with different colors and I can change the colors on this SVG you could change colors like I said I have a video that shows you how to change the colors of SVG's so I'm not gonna do all that today I don't think I'm gonna do today is size this up and put on the show you got to put on the shirt okay first of all let's go ahead and do this the sighs wood creaking to cut and print which is caught we have to do a cut print for sublimation with Cricut so we have to go by the size and the size is just 0.75 by 9 okay I'm gonna do 6.75 go ahead and go across like this right here 6.75 go over okay that's the picture right there i know ii said i just don't like i hate that I have to cook with um that side I wish I could do a bigger footprint could but I'm still trying to figure out how to um I can do it you can't print bigger on um silhouette but I don't have a cutter to cut my glitter bigger you know I'm saying so I have to do this size because my glitter has to be good okay on my Cricut so yes that's it like you say you if you want that you can't print this bigger if you're just doing to the mission but since I'm using glitter I might just use that size right now until I figure it up to figure out the other ways of doing it then put the words I'm going to make it bigger I'm gonna make the words vital okay this is my shirt since my own pictures that I'm gonna make my words I'll stay in my picture so I can have some my picture so my shirt can be evened out let's see okay everything said now I have the UM the width six point seven to seven and then um the height is seven point seven three eight I like the way cuz if I go any I could go down to nine but it's gonna it's not gonna look right so I like the way it look like like that then I have her on the words this is gonna be my no on black and this is gonna be glitter one black okay so I need to do is go here so I got my size everything together I need to go ahead and duplicate her make sure you have everything situated before you duplicate it cuz you do not want to change you okay so now this is a cutting print files I got a highlighting right here it says cut and print okay and then this one also says cut and print but I do not want this to be a cut and print I want this to be a cuts okay just so right here it's flattening and you sit down here she's flattened and she's ready to get cut pretty cooked just right here now I'm siding her and I'm going to go ahead and go to see it's print right there I'm gonna no field I'm go ahead and wheeled her see how that was just the UM cooked so it's gonna cut around her butter arrange and sent to the front so you can see just what I'm gonna do when I know my shirt this is how it's gonna be okay cannot sub on 100% cotton or dark colors unless you put it on vinyl first on white glitter vinyl okay I tried to so I tried to do the super fine it was a little bit too dark so just keep it with the white vinyl the white glitter vinyl okay look at like I said before this is gonna be my white glitter I'm it's red but it's this color I wanted to do it you want me to put it white I can put it right someone be confusing imma go ahead and change the color up here to make it white okay okay but this doesn't matter because I'm whatever vinyl I put in my cutter that's what's gonna cut out okay for all you're a newbie still all the ones that you know just started couldn't using the cookie get kind of confusing so now that you see over here you have the cutting print for her and you have this is um welded and she's flattened you have to flatten it to cut and print or to something mate you hit the flattener okay so now I'm gonna work with this down here this is just a cut so you see this this um go here so make sure that this is ready it should be welded and it's just a it's a cut so let's go ahead and see um this is this was already image so it's not words that I made this was a SVG already so it's not really ready to cut okay let's go ahead him to make it as you see right here she's on a white sheet of paper because this is going to be sublimation printer I have two printers you can use both print you can use the same printer for each you gotta have one sublimation printer if he does information you have to have a regular printer if you do a regular cut and print okay we're just gonna be sent to my sublimation printer and then you see this mat this is gonna be cut on my silver glitter I think this is gonna be cut when you know what I changed this to white I'm gonna change this to white because I'm going to be using um black shirts when you go ahead and cancel that and go back and change this so even though I could have left it black cos might like I said doesn't matter but I won't let you so you won't be confused I'm gonna change this to white I'm thinking about putting your own white glitter also okay cuz I'm using a black shirt okay go back to this okay so everything set this is one to my printer this is going to not both of these are going to my cutter and they're sitting on the same mat so I'm gonna worry about having two different mats with these to make sure it even so I won't um it's good over since we want I can say be some vinyl cuz Rhino ain't cheap y'all I know is not cheap okay so you have to mirror because you're putting this on heat you have to mirror both of them so it's clear to mirrored this cuz you're something mating and this is on heat two side mirror that also okay all righty so let me go ahead and get my sublimation everything printed out and I'll be back okay I just want to show you something real quick I got my image RVD cut up I mean print it out from my printer from my own sublimation printer and then I'm gonna show you this when you put down the UM vinyl the glitter bottom make sure you put the shiny side down on the mat okay I'm gonna show you how to yard first so y'all know make sure you put it the shiny side down on the mat make sure it's straight make sure you have a nice sticky mat so will not be moving by from the printer I want to show you that real quick okay and then why this is cutting my to me just cutting their words and then the body parts of the mayor the bottom layer of her I'm gonna go ahead and cut her out besties I'm gonna take this to the printer also I had the printer cut this out also okay and these black registration marks is what keeps the UM Cricut let you know how to print it out so let me go ahead and show you this real quick I already sent it to the printer and I was talking to send it to the cutters it actually where you want to send it to and they already noticed it right here number one it says it's already been printed okay so now it's time to cut it and I'm going to go ahead and send it with paper instead of cardstock I'm gonna put use paper okay and there's a paper I just basically took mine went to my finger and I turned my knife to paper okay so now you know the sitting thinking that that I put loaded into the mat after I put the paper on the mat downloaded then it's gonna cut it out alrighty there she is I got her on a mat this mat ought to be that sticky cuz you know with the paper tears really stands we're gonna show you all the process so you can know how to do it I was gonna skip these process and just go straight through it but I'm gonna show it to you because I already have this process already done I'm one of my printing cut videos but I'm go ahead and go through it again okay I put it on this kind of say I put on paper settings the arrows going because they're telling me go ahead and push the arrow catch they don't push the button [Music] it's so busy you think I'm doing a pretty cook but I'm not well I am but I'm gonna be doing some of the mission also okay so are you thinking this is a prank oh okay now I get the image out of the UM cutter it's cut and it's the same way deal stickers and everything else to cut and print okay that's it out now I'm going to discov I know it's the second step you have to do okay so I make sure this is on a mat upside down like I said it's shiny side down I'm good to my computer okay so now that we've done this already which is it's done today check your stance it's completed it's print and cut so now we got to go down to here to the cut and I gotta change my settings back over to vinyl you know what this is winter vinyl so make sure you change it to glitter vinyl so that's custom because it is tougher you need to get a tougher cut with vinyl okay and I have my I have my binary little already favorite some way to push glitter okay then I'm gonna go ahead and push the button and it's ready to cook and I was always home I met it to give it a little tug so after that now I gotta push the see here like to see my computer southern is dead is cutting and I back at this when this pretty everything cook I just have to read everything I'll show you that real quick to already have a video on how the weed I'm go ahead and show you again so you can all see you just be one quick process for you I'm gonna take my little scraper thing and just trying to pull on the paper pull it up okay now you just go ahead and poke around a picture how about I do it this way better huh hold it down with the best way you can I really want to test the ink on the other side and they put it would be much more vibrant when we um to be sublimated okay a little earring out of here so now I'm just gonna cut around the image stuff to stay with with my nose I can okay and I'm also gonna separate the image from the words okay okay so let's go ahead and read out this glitter Whedon glitter is not too hard so let me go ahead and do this with y'all to see me do it you can't see the camera because it's white for the best way to read glitter it's a good go from the back of course just pour a little part closer to the ears and just pour it all around it you can certainly be tough with glitter cuz it's so deep you keep on pulling that pieces of it all I like it I like this image because it's not too many cuts in it it's just not a round surface but it's not too many you know cut better to do this when you trying to even it up on the arm Matt it's gonna be better to do it this way let me go here to lead out my words my phrase around it just start from the corner get your little piece wrap it and put yankees you can be able just tear it off okay you said your perfect setup is he ever seen the camera with a pen john wetton is by now but I'll try to make sure I see the full effect in the camera so sorry about that okay and I go down and I'm gonna go ahead and see some spots again take over here the little letters and Gert y'all I was right on the money I almost thought I had to cut these this bird over again but I didn't make sure you have enough I know very sticky in here don't thing I don't like about I'm simply made known by no because you can feel it you can feel the vinyl on the bottom on the back of the arm sublimation it's like a patch patchy feeling like a vinyl of course regular glitter vinyl and some permission is just so much is so soft and you'll have to worry about me feeling anything but guess what you got a do if you want to do it on dark colors and tighten tighter percent cotton shirts you have to do it like this you gotta get that patchy feeling on the back of it okay back Lord and still worthy I'm gonna get my he pressed together situated I did this shirt for my son and I use my mini press on that my Cricut easy press on this so I let me go ahead and just try to do this new one then just this project on my impress this is my first time using my heat press before so the mission on black uncle later okay I made this with my son and I like it I just my first one time doing it it's been a while and I see what you can tell when you um don't have the eye and a half together right here under the shirt so it kind

glitter vinyl okay so let's want to show you how that and not it's prepped his shirt first thing we need to do is go ahead and press it no first thing we need to do is go ahead and get the lint roller you got a little flip it based you can see a lot on black okay we'll see all that and I ever see that out here I'm glad I did that um shake it and press it get all the heat and moisture out of it using a medium shirt and skilled skilled in 100% cotton go ahead and get more straps with about five seconds sorry I got the window open like I said I had to let the fume dust in his heat press and it's kind of loud outside from the highways right there okay when you just have the mission you supposed to put butcher paper in between a shirt but I'm not gonna do that because we're stepping on top of glitter so it would not bleed through the glitter I'm not gonna put any butcher paper between the shirt okay well but I will put the foot put your paper on top of the shirt okay the first thing we gotta do is go ahead and set up our glitter always do three inches below for them a little ruler right there a bit more now you see how the glitter paper if you're your first time using literacy how it's already have this contact paper just ink paper on there and you don't have to even use whichever when you good or you can just use that but I'm gonna use anybody's to protect my heat press that's perfect I feel good now put the words down right here and make sure when you put the word down do not let the plastic touch each other so I want to give you kind of close to the body so I'm gonna cut around here so you can get a little close to it on the right when it works too far from the image okay now I have it on the heat press I'm go ahead and put my put your tip on top of it I'm gonna go ahead put my boot up camp on top of it and go ahead and press it for like ten seconds four hundred to ten seconds if you can um just to get that glitter to stay stick one for little eyes oh I don't do I just do ten seconds just get that glitter down 400 for ten seconds I'll do 15 400 for 15 seconds now let it cool for a little bit I'm gonna bring it over here on table because I want the cool before I put the picture on there because I don't want the picture to fade off one the ink on the glitter before I put it on the heat press okay bring it over here let it cool off a little bit see I just pull it off there's the glitter I'm gonna lift that one the word but if so won't do to gonna put that back on the top of the word when I put the ink on here okay so it's cooled off a little bit I

watching bye bye", "f4I0wJsCBNc": "[Music] hello guys welcome back to miss sugi lovecraft and today um what i'm going to show you is um how you could make your own spray for sublimation on cotton shirt and what i have here i use our 20 pound paper to print my image as you can see 20 pound paper to print my image i also got from the dollar store a bottle spray bottle um this is the mini wax poly acrylic um water base got this from amazon it's the eight fluid ounce i want to say it was eleven dollars i got some water it is eight ounce which is one cup of water and i got my tablespoon measuring um spoon what i'm gonna do is i'm go i'm not gonna put it in my um my measuring cup because this is what i use in my kitchen so i won't do that i mean you'd probably have to get one just for that but what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna pour let's first let's see let's make sure this fits in this bottle so here we go i didn't check that first but it does fit in the bottle then i'm going to get my poly acrylic let me probably shake it up a little bit get my poly acrylic and i'm going to put two tablespoon inside here all right two tablespoon inside there gonna close it up i'm gonna shake it up this is a way you could make your own spray for sublimation to put on your cotton t-shirt shake it up well okay i'm gonna spray the shirt and i'm gonna show you and i'm gonna spray the shirt here is the shirt that i'm gonna be using it's a hundred percent cotton okay a hundred percent cotton hopefully you can see it 100 cut okay i put a piece of paper in between because i don't want to have it soak through so i'm going to spray the area so guys i had to change the spray top on this dollar store bottle and i had another spray top so i kind of cut it because you want it to have a spray effect for you to spray out and the dollar store one wasn't working so i'm going to spray the area now and the white paper underneath kind of let me gauge to where i'm gonna spray okay so i'm gonna let it dry and then i will show you once i put the put my image once again like i said i um put this on regular 20 pound paper i kind of got a little bit of the the poly acrylic on there but that doesn't matter right now we just wanted to show you that it will work so you don't have to buy thirty six dollars for four ounce bottle you could get the poly critic mini wax poly acrylic and probably a dollar store spray um bottle a tablespoon to measure and like i said a 20 pound paper so all of this saves you a whole lot of money okay so i'm gonna get this and i'm going to once it's dry we'll be right back to show you the effect so guys here is the moment of truth remember 20 pound paper um printed um with sublimation ink and i am going to put this on the shirt you could um use your heat resistant tape and tape it down so it doesn't move i'll go ahead and do that smooth it out all right so i heated up my press to 385 and i'm going to press it at 60 seconds all right guys here's the moment of truth let's see voila well of course i didn't mirror the jamaica so it's upside down but guys the fact that it came out and it came out beautiful i love it um it worked so don't laugh at me i didn't mirror image the um the print i was so excited to try this out so thank you for watching once again this is miss sugee lovecraft don't forget to like subscribe and share [Music] you", "TU5rGP10SNE": "if you're curious about the next level 3600 like this one right here then this is a video you do not want to miss [Music] in the last video we talked about the Gildan soft style geez 64,000 and today in this video we're going to talk about the oh so popular next level 3600 [Music] there are a ton of blank t-shirt options out there to choose from and this is the second in our shirt review video series there are a few important things you need to consider when trying to choose which t-shirt is right for you comfort style color options price and print ability let's start by talking about comfort this shirt is made out of 100% combed ring-spun cotton what that means to you and I is this is an extremely soft t-shirt because this is a cold drink spun cotton t-shirt it's softer than your standard cotton which you'll find in like a guild in G 5000 and also your ring spun cotton is like your gilding soft style t-shirts the next level 3600 t-shirt is comparable to the Bella canvas 3000 won and the American Apparel 2001 t-shirt which are all combed ring spun cotton and what that means is they're all extremely comfortable t-shirts now it's time to talk about styling this shirt is definitely a fashion fitted tee which is why it's really popular with clothing lines and band merchandise this shirt has a baby ribbed collar it's got side seams and a tearaway label one thing that I've noticed after wearing these shirts for a very long time is after extensive use the bottom seam of the t-shirt can actually start to come unraveled so that's just something to take into consideration this shirt definitely wears a lot longer than a lot of other t-shirts so if you compare it to like the Gildan soft style G 64,000 it's gonna be come down lower on your body this is definitely one of our most popular t-shirts at Twin City tees and also one of our most recommended this shirt comes in extra small through Forex l when it comes to shirt colors the next level colors are definitely limited compared to your Bella canvas and gild and t-shirts although the shirt colors that they do offer are very good ones as for price this is definitely one of the most affordable fashion fitted combed ring-spun t-shirts on the market it will of course cost a little more than your ring spun cotton and standard cotton t-shirts as you can see here on our chart this is our price here at Twin City tees this is for 50 t-shirts with a one color print and this is just to show you where this shirt lines up among a lot of our other popular t-shirt options I want to make it very clear that these prices are subject to change okay next let's talk about screen printing when it comes to printing at Twin City tees we use water-based and discharge inks primarily and because of that the dye lot of the t-shirt is extremely important and what a dye lot is is where they actually dye the fabric of the t-shirt to give it its color next level dyes their t-shirts and multiple factories around the world and because of this they're starting to show a little bit of inconsistencies and dialogues here I'll show you an example right here as a counterexample Bella canvas actually manufactures their shirts all over the world but they dye them all in the United States which gives them a lot more control among their dialogues as a customer you shouldn't have to concern yourself with this too much I just bring it up to let you know that as next level has grown some of their quality control has fallen a little bit so that's something to pay attention to in the future but when it comes to dye lots at Twin Cities it's our job to make sure that you guys get a high quality product with consistent printing so we'll take care of the dialogue issues so you don't have to worry about anything as mentioned before the next level 3600 is definitely one of our most popular t-shirts we print thousands of them a month they're soft they're stylish and they come in a great price point so if you're trying to choose which t-shirt is right for your business band or group consider the next level 3600 so now there's only one thing left for you to do click on the link below fill out an estimate let us know you want the next level 3600 if that is indeed what you want and before you know it you'll have t-shirts of your own if you're curious about the guild and saw style G 64000 check out this video next we'll see you in the next video", "BE4Ddg_1_FA": "Today we're talking about the Canvas\n100% ring-spun cotton t-shirt. Now this is one of our favorite ring-spun\ncotton t-shirts. One because of how many colors it's offered in, love it that it\ncomes in so many cool colors. It's also great because it comes in a lady's\nversion too, the Bella 100% ring-spun cotton shirt. It has a great fit, love this shirt so much. It actually, I think\nover the course of a lot of washes it maintains that softness which was a big thing for a hundred percent ring-spun. Instead of just telling you though, we do have our model. He's gonna come over show it in action. First thing you're gonna notice is just that tailored fit, partially\nbecause of the side seam here. The side seam makes sure that it just kind of hugs the body. It's not going to be too tight, but it is gonna tailor in a little which is just flattering. Everybody wants now kinda that nicer fabric but also the nicer fit.  The next thing you're going to notice is the neckline. We love this because it's a great dip here not too tight either, has some flexibility. That ring-spun cotton has a little more tug to it than just a regular, 100% cotton. The sleeve length is also awesome, super flattering it's a little higher. It's not going to be baggy, which is great. Now you might be  wondering though, we've talked a lot about a hundred percent ring-spun cotton, how does it, how does it wear over the course of life? Is it gonna shrink, anything that way. With this garment\nyou're not really gonna have to worry about shrinkage over the first few washes. A year or two years down the line, it could potentially if you're gonna nuke this thing in the dryer but it is pre-shrunk and very true to size, so we love this. Again, like I said though it does come in a ladies version, the Bella 100% ring-spun cotton t-shirt. Overall, great shirt, love it, a ton of color options and you look great in it too. Thank you. On the Coed Monkey Soft Scale we rate this t-shirt a two. Thanks for watching this video please let us know\nif you have any questions because here at Coed Monkey, Soft Matters, and so do our customers.", "-MshQ4K83z4": "welcome back to another video so today I'm gonna be showing you guys how about washing and drying my t-shirts so they won't shrink or lose any quality [Music] so I've quite a few shirts here I have one two three four five great t-shirts of course how we're letting gray three black t-shirts one two never mind just two black t-shirts should have a white t-shirt but I think I forgot it I'm gonna be right back and the white t-shirt so for starters one of the most important things to do it's of course sort them by color I've already done that as I showed you I have to graze the blacks and a white all separate the most important thing to do is to check the Kerr attack in most cases you're probably watching cold water when you're watching t-shirts especially colored t-shirts any kind of heat will shrink that t-shirt so we're gonna do a bit of a test I'm gonna use the Machine and also some hand washing methods to see which one works best before we get started we're going to measure the size of a cup of t-shirts a grey one and a black one just to see if they're gonna be the same exact size before and after washing let's do it [Music] tell me baby is a good touch time I managed alright now that we're done with the measuring let's let's get the washing so I have two gray split teeths from keeping New York everywhere so I'm gonna actually machine wash and in hand wash the other one they're both the same measurements both a size large so we're gonna see how do you still hold up so as you can see there's nothing really special about this wash I'm using is by a brand called Hotpoint have no clue what that is this would just actually inside my apartment when I moved in so this is the best we got we're using a small load we're using whites light and we always want to wash code as I mentioned one thing I will say about these low and washing machines even though you chose to wash and code in most cases is still gonna use hop for majority of the washing so that's just something to keep in mind and I can't say that it'd be the case for all washing machines but it definitely is for this one like I mentioned I don't know much about the brand hat point but I'm guessing this pretty low budget so let's look review what I got load size small I have this on whites light but let's actually go to delicates because we don't really want anything bad to happen to these clothes of course and for cold let's use tap cold we've got the shirts in there I'm gonna be using Tide Pods just one of them just one drop that in there they were gonna hit start now for the hand washing I'm going to be using Tide simply clean and fresh I'm gonna pour a little bit into the lid just a little bit make sure we're running cold water [Music] for the shout it's all the way alright and how do we have to save mother's before with cold water we're gonna pour a little bit of this in there mr. Bob Dole the t-shirt against itself I usually mainly focus on the pits [Music] because of course that's what perspiration happens very good and they'll rub it in and I do that for both mine arms now we're just going to let that soak for a little bit let me get little more water in there as I mentioned cold water dry like this so as you can see the water looks a little bit murky because of course is shirt was dirty and I'm going to check on the other shirts as I mentioned this water is hot we're just gonna do the same thing which allows for this to soak it now again I would not recommend using hot water to do these that of course what this all is about we're gonna test and see which method works best and then Jenny all right so a couple hours have passed since this has been soaking these items are completely done they've actually sat in here a little bit longer they should've I had to tend to some other stuff so I'm hoping these didn't drink at all it looks good that one looks good that one looks good so what we're gonna do with these items is hang dry them [Music] so I dressed in all the gray shirts out of the washer and then hung them on this drying rack that I got from Amazon this is a stainless steel drying rack I'm not sure exactly how much I paid for it but what I'll do is go ahead and drop a link down below so if you're wanting something like this you can find it now we have to dry out this so it's kind of hard to get a good angle on it but when I was doing I would grab a piece twist it fold it twist it fold it twist it and that's usually enough to wring out enough of the water I'm just going to put this on the rack as well and then let it dry overnight so now we're done washing all the gray t-shirts we're gonna go ahead and tackle the black t-shirts and I mentioned earlier I'll have two black t-shirts one of them is a keeping New York everywhere split tee another one is my champion logo black team I originally planned to hand wash one and machine wash the other but it actually got really late I got kind of doing something else and it's like almost 11 o'clock and I don't want to be up all night doing this video so I'm gonna go ahead and toss both of these in the washer before I do that I'm gonna do the same exact thing I did with the great tee and I'm gonna measure to keeping New York everywhere black tee as you can see keeping New York everywhere size large turn it inside out and let's take it to be measured before toss it in the washer don't need a one-handed I know two t-shirts and a washer by yourself is just a waste of water but it's kind of what I got to do I'm just like before one pod and we're gonna keep all this settings the same small delicate tap cold so now that we got the black t-shirts inside to watch her I'm going to go ahead and just hand wash this white t-shirt this is the last one has to be washed this is a white t-shirt from Urban Outfitters so let's do it [Music] alright so now we got the washer going and we got this white tee soaked in so now we're gonna wait for this cycle to be done and about that time I'll go ahead and take the shirt out of the sink alright so now we're gonna hang dry these hang drying is the most essential part of this process alright so lastly we're gonna tackle the white t-shirt and the same no I do have a setting that's going to be a drain and spin setting on my washer so for this one I'm going to utilize that if you don't have a drain and spin setting we're gonna utilize the first method I showed you which is the twist and ring [Music] [Music] as you saw I gave it a little bit of a twist in the sink as you can see it's still pretty wet so we're gonna head and drop this into washer so just gonna toss that in there we're gonna go ahead and twist this to the drain and spin and then see what happens here we go so now it's gonna drain and spin itself and then we can hang that up so it's been about maybe five minutes and I just heard to wash your stop which means this should be fully drain now all right so far so good it's pretty drain and nice and damp and ready to be hung drive the rack is pretty full got one two three four starts here the middle bar has another shirt another shirt oh boom there we go utilize this bar right here alright so all of these shirts are washed they're all drying right behind me I'm gonna get back at you guys tomorrow and then we're going to check it see how they turned out the next day it is officially the next day and the t-shirts have been drying for precisely 21 hours something like that I just got off of work and it's about eight o'clock and if you remember I think I put them to dry maybe a like nine or ten yes about almost 24 hours they are officially dry so let's check them out and Dan we're going to measure same exact t-shirts again to see if they lost any size or quality so let's do it so this was the hand wash t-shirt so he make sure he keep this separate just to remember that was hand washed the rest of these gray shirts were machine wash so I'm just going to compare these two in size because I took measurements of these so machine washed and washed and then we're gonna compare size to the black t as well was it this one yep this one hand washed cold water so a measuring from the top like before so see there all the way down and it is at 30 just a tad bit under so hmm I measured these a mouth will last my little notes here but you see the great teacher we've had at length 30 so let's see if the chest still not 23 and a half so we got the chest starting here 23 and a half so I get to save the state I really didn't lose much size with hand washing and again his home was hand washed in cold water and then hung to dry and now we're gonna test the other gray shirt that was machine wash and then hung dry so the second one just measured out for 29 and a half in a chest both these are the same exact size it looks like we might have lost a half an inch in the length and again this was the one I would machine wash so it's safe to say that the hot water that it did in a wash cycle may have shrunk just a little bit but let's check the chest so the chest is still twenty three and a half inches now to be fair I only measured one of these great t-shirts because since they're the same size I assumed that the dimensions would have been the same but that's false they probably weren't exactly the same so I should have measured both so if we were gonna lose size of the t-shirt we would have lost size from both the chest and length so at this point I don't think that the machine washing affected anything but the true testament will be the black shirt because again that went inside the machine and I did get measurements of that before going in so let's check that [Music] twenty-nine and a half like shirt merchants out at 29 they have and it appears that the black shirt didn't lose any size at all and that was in a machine wash on the dry so in conclusion I would say that it doesn't really matter which method used whether it's gonna be hand washing or machine washes make sure you use cold water and use the delicates settings for your washing machines if you have a washing machine that allows for you to control the temperature through the whole wash make sure you use cold but if it doesn't as you see minded and have those settings and for the most part I didn't lose any quality or size of my T's if you enjoyed this video make sure to leave a thumbs up comment down below and if you're new to the channel make sure you hit the subscribe button and click the

Now, this t-shirt by Alternative Apparel is one\nof our best selling ring spun cottons for a few reasons. One because it's Alternative Apparel offers a really soft fabric. It's a thinner fabric texture also, compared to\nother 100% ring spun cottons. A really fine thread count, the threads are very tight.\nWith that thinner thread also means it's just going to flow better.\n\u200bComes in some great colors. Great fit. It's right now between kind of the Next Level,\nCanvas 100% ring spun cotton pricing and the American Apparel, it's a good middle ground.\nOffers the same great fit, awesome fabric. Instead of telling you all just about it we've\ngot Tyler coming over, going to show it in action.\n\u200bFirst thing you're going to notice a great fit. Has the side seam here, which now a days\nis standard on any shirt that's going to be a nicer brand. Offers that side seam so it's\ngoing to be tailored right to your body. \u200bThe collar here is a great collar. Little\nthinner than other brands. The seam is on the inside also so it's a very flush outer.\nPrint location across the front is awesome. We have right here the sleeve length, great,\nright mid bicep. Not baggy like a lot of the other shirts that we're talking about on these\nvideos. Any time we're going with a nicer fabric and a better fit the sleeve should\nnaturally complement that. We don't want the sleeve to be baggy and the sides tailored.\nIt would be totally uneven. This shirt has great proportions.\n\u200bIn terms of the length we've noticed that this shirt seems a little shorter than the\nAmerican Apparel or even the Next Level comparison. It does seem a little shorter. Not bad, it's\njust something to note. Check out the size charts on our site and again this shirt is\njust great all around shirt. Kind of that middle price point in the 100% ring spun cotton.\n\u200bNow, we've talked a lot about 100% ring spun cotton and kind of the softness, the\nfit. You might be wondering what about shrinkage anything that way. Now, it is 100% ring spun\ncotton so over the course of it's life it could start peeling. It also could start kind\nof distorting in terms of how you dry it. If it's on high heat. We're not talking about\nfirst wash, second wash, the first washes. We're talking about a year down the line.\nIf you nuke the shirt. Longevity wise, anytime you want a shirt for the long hall a blend.\nA 50/50 blend, a 60/40 is going to be better than this for the long hall of the life of\nthe shirt, but this is a great shirt. You're going to love it and overall this is one of\nour best sellers because Alternative Apparel is a hot brand right now.\n\u200bTyler you look awesome in it too. Thank you. On the Coed Monkey Soft Scale we rate\nthis t-shirt a two. Thanks for watching this video. Please let us know if you have any\nquestions because here at Coed Monkey soft matters and so do our customers.", "kPUMT4N8IEo": "what's up guys my name is Dan McCready I'm here at Twin Cities in st. Paul Minnesota and today we're going to talk about the different kinds of cotton when choosing the right t-shirt you can only love you if you've looked at cotton t-shirts you'll probably see that there are a lot of different options you've got standard cotton ring spun combed ring spun heirloom organic lemon shrimp coconut shrimp what do these all mean what are the differences between these types of shirts first of all all cotton no matter if it's ring spun combed organic it all has to go through a process of spinning where the cotton is drawn out into long strands and turned into a yarn the yarns later sewn into fabric which makes your t-shirt so your basic standard cotton t-shirt such as your gilding g500 it's spun into a yarn but a lot of the short strands of cotton and left in there and you get a rougher feel less durability because of that it's the least expensive oh it's a shirt and I saved a buck next you've got your ring spun cotton all that means is there's an additional process of spinning the yarn and in that a lot of those short strands will be taken out this gives you a softer more durable type of cotton not too shabby the next one is your combed ring spun cotton and that's just an additional process of coming out short and mid-sized strands of cotton leaving you with a really long strong durable piece of yarn and then this would be like your next level 3600 your American Apparel these give you a much softer much more durable t-shirt this shirt is really soft and nice I love it if you've looked at Bella canvas shirt so you've noticed they have something called heirloom cotton all this really is is a cone ring spun cotton they've coined their own term heirloom cotton it's their process of towing and spinning the cotton and it's a marketing term they claim it's the best in the industry if it is or not that's up to you to decide but that's all that is is a cone ring spun cotton heirloom cotton huh highlight misty and then lastly we've got organic cotton which has nothing to do if it's ring spun or told and everything to do with the way it was grown and harvested in an eco-friendly way so to recap you start with your standard cotton also known as carded open in cotton that's your cheapest least durable roughest feeling cotton and then you go up to ring-spun which is softer more durable a little more expensive and then you go into your combed ring-spun cotton t-shirt those are much more expensive but they're much softer very durable very nice t-shirts are made out of this and then finally you can go into your organic Cotton's

t-shirts especially this year besides the odd polo button-downer sweater 95 of the time i have on a t-shirt i walked into my closet recently to pick one out for the day and realize that majority of the ones i own were either deformed torn or years old for such a staple i wanted to invest in some quality pieces that would not only look good but hold up over time as with anything once i get into something i dive way too deep i spent the next few days researching blogs reddit posts youtube videos and everything in between to learn everything and anything i could about what makes a t-shirt great a few more days and nearly six hundred dollars later i got the top few brands that were mentioned frequently across those platforms i put them all through their paces and made sure i tested them as thoroughly as i could to find the best t-shirt available for men right now if you appreciate the effort all i ask for is a like and free to consider subscribing it means the absolute world my ideal t-shirt is one that nails three things the fit the feel and the overall quality my definition of a good fit is one that drapes well hugs the arms and is fitted in the chest but leave some room in the stomach for a large meal or those temporary quarantine pounds for the feel i'm looking for something that is soft to the touch in terms of quality i prefer a heavier t-shirt that has a solid collar is durable and doesn't shrink when it's washed i'll be giving away the shirt i rank the highest in whatever size and color the winner picks to enter subscribe to the channel drop a quick like and comment a video idea down below and i'll pick a winner in the next few weeks stick around to the end of the video to find out which one you could potentially win thanks for watching let's start with the uniqlos to pima cotton crewneck t-shirt i've seen such high praises for this tee on reddit and decided to give it a shot after reading glowing reviews made in vietnam the shirt is 100 supima cotton supima cotton is a brand of cotton that is grown in california texas new mexico or arizona and is amongst the top one percent of cotton grown in the world it features extra long fibers that supposedly give it more strength softness and color retention and less pilling than normal fibers there is no weight that is advertised but the fabric feels pretty thin in comparison to the others on this list the fit is between a slim and a regular fit it hugs the arms well and leaves room in the stomach but shrinks a bit after a wash i opted for a small and it fits well the neck opening is on the smaller end and wears higher than the rest which may be a plus depending on your preference for 15 the t-shirt is pretty good but leaves a lot to be desired the quality definitely isn't there and the t-shirt doesn't hold up after a few washes i noticed a little bit of shrinkage after a wash but nothing too significant it definitely lost some of its initial softness when i washed it and feels like a normal jquery t-shirt afterwards the color feels pretty weak and although it's fine now i suspect i'll develop a bacon neck and a few more washes people have said that the quality on these used to be very good but has gone down in recent months when the production shifted from cambodia to vietnam the fabric feels thinner fits worse and doesn't hold up nearly as well overall for 15 dollars it's still a solid t-shirt for anyone on a budget but it isn't as great as it used to be considering companies like bella and canvas make a similar quality t-shirt for four dollars i'd rather spend my money there and save up for something a bit higher end ask it is a swedish company started in 2015 with the pursuit to create the best basics and as a minimalist favorite i've heard a lot about this company and i've always wanted to try them out so i went with a regular t-shirt ascot uses 100 egyptian cotton and has a weight of 180 gsm the fabric was soft to the touch but not as soft as cuts it offers enough structure for it to feel well made but flows enough to drape over the body really well ask it offers 15 different sizes for the t-shirts from an extra small to an extra large and then breaking down even further into short regular and long it lets everyone find their ideal fit which seems like common sense but is rare for some reason the t-shirt was dyed sewn and assembled all in portugal and the craftsmanship is great the collar is ribbed and feels very sturdy after a few washes i can confirm it holds up just as well as it did when i was brand new the fit is what shined through the most this was snug in all the right places but left just enough room in your stomach without looking sloppy you'll still get that streamlined silhouette and tons of versatility with this t-shirt i opted for a size small and it fit exactly how i expected it to i could also probably get away with the medium but i'm not sure if it would hug the chest and arms as well at 45 this is pricey but worth it in my opinion ask it offers a great product and their customer service is always willing to help it offers a simple well-made crisp t-shirt and a ton of different colors overall i was very impressed and it definitely lived up to my expectations moving along to the cuts split hem crewneck t-shirt just a quick heads up their marketing is insanely persistent so be prepared for them to take over your facebook youtube and instagram ads as soon as you visit their website the ads obviously worked on me because i eventually gave in just to see what the hype was about immediately out of the box the t-shirt was insanely soft and bouncy it's made of cut's own fabric called pike up the only info they give on it is that it's a tri-blend fabric but if i were to guess i'd say it's a mixture of cotton elastane and polyester the fabric feels very performance oriented in a synthetic way even though it's made to wear casually that isn't a bad thing but just something to note compared to the 100 cotton options on this list i opted for a medium as the fit is on the slimmer end the t-shirt sits a bit long and bunches up near my waist and makes my legs look very short when i wear these with cuff jeans i do prefer to wear them more with joggers as it looks a bit more streamlined they have a build your own concept where you can have a choice between three necks the crew the v-neck and the henley and three bottoms the elongated curve the split and the classic curve the color palette is always on point because they stick close to neutral tones while adding new shades every season the fabric is thin and breathable but not in a cheap way the collar is very thin so it eliminates the chances of deforming after a few washes i haven't experienced any shrinkage at all at 48 dollars we can definitely see where their marketing budget comes from i'm impressed by their buttery fabric the stretch how low maintenance it is and the fit but probably wouldn't buy another one due to the length and the price up next let's talk about the everlane premium weight crew in a size small although it is marked as a slim fit this is the boxiest out of all the t-shirts leaving plenty of rooms in the sleeves and through the body at 6.2 ounces i love the weight of this t-shirt but it was the most basic feeling out of the batch it reminds me of a fresh golden tee but with a bit more weight it was scratchy initially but has softened slightly after about a year of washes and wear the neck has held up pretty well and i love the color of this t-shirt coming in at 30 dollars i would say this isn't worth it in my opinion but if you like boxier fits and a wide variety of colors to choose from this might be the way to go next up we have the robert brockett t-shirt i was introduced to this brand when my girlfriend snagged me the white one from nordstrom's anniversary sale last year i went back shortly after and bought the dark gray one for myself and then picked up the navy one this past year the canadian company calls it the rocket tea but it is also known as a georgia crew and some retailers it's made from 100 ultra fine us grown cotton and is finished with a heavy enzyme blush robert brockett claims this helps give it a worn and broken in feel and gives the fabric a slight sheen both of which i can attest to the material is cool to the touch and very smooth these have been a part of my rotation for about a year now and i've experienced no loss of color all mine are a size small they might fit a bit large initially but they shrank a decent amount on the first wash so something to keep in mind when sizing the shirts length was perfect when new but is slightly short for me after the shrinkage the arms and chest region came in nicely and were perfect for me after the wash the collar shows no sign of wear even after wearing these regularly for about a year the split hem is a nice feature that prevents any pulling for more athletic legged people there are 60 on the website but please don't pay that much for this t-shirt nordstrom's anniversary cell brings it down to 38 for all the staple colors and i've seen quirkier ones go for as low as 20 on nordstrom rack just be sure you search for the georgia tea on the discount sites at that price these are some of the best bang for your buck and are worth stocking up on 316 specializes in raw denim so i was a little hesitant adding them to this list however there seems to be a cult-like following for their t-shirts and i had to see what it was all about the regular crew was sold out so i opted for the pocket t-shirt but the material and fit are the exact same right off the bat these are super soft to the touch almost a viscose like softness to them but they're 100 american grown pima cotton the fabric is roughly 160 gsm so it feels substantial in a good way the triple stitched collar feels very sturdy there were two lines of stitching on the collar and one line right below after looking at the size chart i opted for a medium the fit was okay but was easily the biggest drawback about this t-shirt the sleeves didn't hug my arms and it was very boxy around the torso area i might need to try the small and report back if it's any better the shirts are made in the states so they come at a premium they're only available in packs of 2 which i don't understand why but many higher end t-shirts seem to go this route colors are limited to black and white in the pima shirts as of me making this video they come in at 95 for a pack of 2 or about 47.50 a piece they're really high quality so the price is justified but they aren't my favorite solely due to the fit lady white company was started on this one t-shirt i was super excited to get this shirt in because i was intrigued by their claims of no side seams it's something that i haven't experienced before this model is called the hour t-shirt it's made of 100 cotton grown in north carolina the t-shirt is then knitted cut and sewn in los angeles the construction on this t-shirt was flawless the double needle stitch sits perfectly on the collar and lines up perfectly with the shoulder seam which is actually very hard to accomplish the fit was relaxed and boxy so i'm glad i got a small to get the fit i was looking for the main feature about this is the lack of seams on the side they claim it helps achieve a more natural drape and allows a t-shirt to conform better to the body they accomplish this by using circular knitting machines that allow the torso area to be sewn as a tube it's super unique and is something i found really cool the fabric itself is six ounces so it has a very good weight to it i ordered a size small in the dark gray color and it fit really well however i was disappointed when i took it out and the fabric was very rough the fabric didn't have that soft brush-like finish that i looked for personally it felt like a fresh vintage tee from the mid-1900s which isn't a bad thing just something i don't prefer i would almost compare this shirt to raw denim it's not the most comfortable and soft out of the bag but you can feel its heft and sense of quality it's supposed to break in and get softer the more and more it's worn so i'll have to see what it's like a few years from now gray navy black and white come in a pack of two for 99. if you want a different color you'll be looking at 55 for a single one the construction and fit were great and check my boxes but overall the t-shirt was okay i'll probably get heat for this since this t-shirt is supposed to be the holy grail but i just wasn't that impressed by its feel maybe i just don't get it maybe i just haven't worn it enough but i don't think i would run out and grab another one anytime soon i know there weren't many negatives or drawbacks in this video but it just goes to show how great most of these shirts actually are all of them are worthy enough for a spot in your rotation but it just depends on what you look for in a perfect tee based off the fit softness and overall construction ask it took the top prize for me i love how it doesn't look out of place under a suit or on shorts it's a crisp t-shirt that only gets better with age i would give robert barakat a close second followed by cuts 316 lady white co uniqlo and then everlane in that order i can't wait to give away an ask a tea to one of you guys if you

and we're back and we're gonna be doing some things with some sublimation when understood on 100% cotton t-shirts now we've got some colored shirts so what we'll do that instead of going through the desizing because the I said some things on the last video that I wasn't quite understanding what I was reading but there's not ad sizer in the shirts on the white and the gray it is a sizing chemical that they put into it so I was a little confused on that and now that I've kind of got it straightened out but there is a chemical that they put in the shirt it's a sizing and if you have that in the white and gray shirts when you do your sublimation with the sublimation ink it's not gonna work you're gonna want to put some problems so that's why there's the D sizer and it actually takes these the chemical I guess out of the shirt and makes it to where the poly tea when it goes into it it will actually absorb into the material that will then give it what it needs to take the ink and absorb it and let the e do what it's supposed to do within the material so I got that a little straightened out so I wanted to kind of put that in there when I look back on the video I go like I don't know what he's talking about but anyways I guess I didn't but anyways the the D sizer is for the white and gray shirts and when it comes to the sweatshirts all your sweat search whether they got color or not all your sweat shirts have the sizing in it also so you'll need to use the D sizer to get that if you're using the Nepali tee from die press so anyways let's um let's see what we can do and maybe we can put together something and do another shirt how does that sound it sound like a winner oh don't come back right after the intro [Music] you don't sometimes the question might be you know doing the sublimation to 100% cotton is great it looks good on white shirts and as the one video I did it the colors weren't bad on a gold shirt which is kind of light he's kind of a light coat but what are the darker colors how about a gilt and cobalt purple color these guys a little bit darker now sublimation ink doesn't have white so you know you can't you just don't have the white there now you can get up probably a bright light yellow I don't know but what do you do you got those colors and how do you get the colors that will really stand out in a darker garment the sublimation that's the big thing because you know if you're gonna do something nation you want to be able to do them I mean how does it work on the black t-shirt you know now screen printing and using using ink is great all of those things are great the church but what do you do when you're dealing with sublimation and sublimation you're limited I think on some areas to bring out something right because there's no way so let's see how it looks like cobalt and cobalt color kind of a purple color shirt there's a bluish purple blue I don't know you judge for yourself anyways it's a darker garment and let's see how the sublimation works as far as the colors coming out and we'll try to find a picture I haven't picked a picture yet but maybe we'll find a picture that will look good with it so what to try it and see how it works anyways let's go ahead and get this shirt ready the whole thing is is getting a certain threat first and remember the first thing we have to do is we have to spray down the shirt with the poly tee and then we got to let it dry now I could put it and let it air dry up underneath the heat glass and after about 5-10 minutes or something like that each should be dried then we'll press it and and then we'll press for 10 sections then we'll apply the second poly code and then once again let it dry and then press for 10 seconds then we'll be ready to go ahead and put our image on the garment we got to find something that's gonna stand out on a dark garment the sublimation so let's check it out see if it works okay we are back and we're gonna see what we can do as far as we're gonna look here at this shirt that we have laid out here this time we're gonna do a kind of a cobalt cobalt I think that's what gilded golden - cobalt color and we're gonna do the back of the shirt so we'll do the back and I'll let you see me get that ready [Music] really [Music] there is my polythene mixture and I've already got mixed up in this bottle and go ahead spray this garment and we'll take it over to the heat press I'm letting the heat press it's getting eaten up now I've got this now I don't know how long this lasts in the bottle I mix this a while back and I hope that hope that lasts it's been sealed tight it hasn't been open and so I'm hoping that it's still good so really how long does the polity last as far as in the bottle I mean she can make up a lot at one shot if you're not gonna use it all you know quickly so I didn't know I just used one well it says I got over 20 ounces so I'm crystal either pretty good [Music] [Music] [Music] what we're doing we're gonna Pat this down with our hand a little bit here some say you can fold the garment over and Pat it like this that way you're sure to absorb all of that into the material open it back up and as you can see I shouldn't wet wet so now we're gonna take it over here and put it on the you see me now we're gonna take it and put it nowhere and put it on it he prints actually we're not gonna press it but we're gonna put it under it and let it dry air dry with the heat you know you know what I'm talking about we're gonna take the wet garment and we're gonna put it over here [Music] [Music] now what we're gonna do we're gonna let that heat dry it not letting them pull it not not letting this flat not not letting this touch the garment but but actually letting the garment dry by the heat okay so we're not going to touch it once it gets dried what we'll do we'll present for ten seconds once we present for ten seconds then we're going to go back and we're gonna spray it again only not as heavy as we did the first time just a little bit lighter but we're gonna do that and then from there we'll we'll dry it again and then when we do that we'll press it again we'll get two cures and then once we get those that second cure we can go ahead and put our image on there and I'll take a break in between that which you won't know it but I'll have to print something up and kind of figure something out that's gonna look and pop really good on a cobalt purple blueish type of shirt you see the color you know what it looks like but to try to find something that's gonna look good on that particular shirt so you got darker shirts how does sublimation play into that because you don't have white you have yellow like it some bright I don't know let's try and see it should have some bright colors to be able to work oh yes all starchy feeling if it feels like starch and it's dry it must have done right but it needs to be pressed for 10 seconds to get that cure [Music] [Music] three oh five six seven eight nine [Music] Cure number one now we got to spray it try it cure it again should I even waste my time for you to sit there and watch me go through all that process again yeah so by just the quick magic of video as you can see it's now ready it is now ready the shirt is now ready for a sublimated picture sublimation I remember before when I did the first video I said I've supplemented before he saw you heard me I know a lot of y'all trying to correct me on that way as I sublimated I've sublimated and that's a good thing I've sublimated and and yeah I got the D sizer thing all messed up too but I straightened out I told you when I started doing these videos let's learn together let's learn together and that's what we're doing so I learned a little bit you corrected me on some things how did y'all put any comments down there but and I thank you because hopefully your is ignorance other was on it but anyway that I'm supposed to be telling you how it works but I just got it I didn't understand a whole lot but anyways forgive me for being ignorant so I'm gonna get down here on the computer see if I can get up some kind of picture run it over here on the printer put out something and see how this thing really looks and here we are we are badging I did design something and it's basically our logo like the way our printer is doing probably gonna have to get a better printer because this one here is starting to put a little little lines in there but leather stuff there I don't like that I don't know if that's maybe something on my printer that I'm doing or if it's my printer itself maybe need to be cleaned I've cleaned it several times and it's still doing I'm gonna clean up some of this little ink a little bit of ink and stuff that's on the edges here I don't want it on my shirt so I'm gonna cut that off and then we're gonna place it on the shirt and see how this comes out it's kind of a blue I don't know I don't know how this is going to look beyond it's red it's got some red and it's got some colors so let's see how it works this is on a dark garment that's what I'm wondering about you know with this and and the darker garments how does sublimation really compared to regular screen printing you can't compare to really pretty but you'd have to use lighter shirts so sublimation be good a lot of shirts darker ones I guess it would be okay I don't know I'm not saying that either way don't you say I said it I don't know we find out my class at all see you there so we'll try this good shot he presses heating up I'm gonna get this shirt ready and I'll get the camera set up and I hate messing with cameras but camera setup I'm doing this for you [Music] okay we're fixing get ready and fixing it get ready image on the garment so camera [Music] you [Music] now we've got this set for 70 seconds so that's how long it should take three hundred and eighty five degrees at seventy seconds see how it works [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] now if you noticed the temperature changed the temperature dropped was at 385 it dropped [Music] temperature was at 385 and it drops to [Music] 372 now so you're gonna have a temperature drop I don't make a big difference are 70 seconds is up [Music] we've done as I went through the process and these are darker garments now I was wondering whether or not they could help how well and it would work on darker garments and I'm gonna do some research see if anybody else has been doing darker garments but for me that's unacceptable no I'll wear it but I don't know I just ain't crazy better so anyways we know that it'll work on lighter garments we know it works on lighter garments but what the darker garments it's just not as well and that's because of the color so this is Tom the father's workshop screen-printing and I did the test tried it and not crazy about the darker colors with the sublimation the lighter colors works great anyways like and subscribe please and we'll see you next time and [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "OLfyx76iStU": "yo what's going on guys my name is have Skater welcome to the channel summer is finally here feels like it or not with everything going on in the world currently I mean literally summer solstice is one week away from the date this video is going live but anyway into the am sent me some of their teas from the relatively new branded basic collections and we're going to be checking them out I'm actually pretty excited to be doing so because I actually ordered a few of these a couple weeks ago and I've been waiting for a time to open them up so we're gonna look at these ones as well let's start off with the black basics tea we have right here um let's go ahead and just open the stuff first toss it to the side and reveal your tea right here the brain to basics come in two different types of fabrics these t-shirts have a 60-40 poly cotton blends the same exact materials as they use as their graphic tees again pretty basic tee notice no into the am logo on the back there the only logo you got is this one right here so there is your black one let's go ahead and crack open the charcoal one now which again is pretty much going to be the hot sticky same exact type of t-shirt here but here is your charcoal looking one has a little bit of a nice texture to it that I'm pretty fond of both of these are fitting as expected which is great I mean they fit well snug in the arms I don't know what it is about all the charcoal tees but they feel like they're way softer than the other ones and I love them and yeah there are 12 total colors of the poly cotton tees you got this the black one and this charcoal one and you'll be seeing two other of them at the end of this video moving on to the other fabric we have here this one I believe the dark gene or dumped called blue gene one and this is their their other fabric which oh yeah first first impressions here is definitely a different type of fabric go ahead and take a good look at that these 100% cotton ones fit a little bit different than the poly blend they're a little bit more looser all around in the material feels a bit more coarse from a regular cotton t-shirt but compared to like a normal Hanes t-shirts first thing that comes to mind one where I think hunter sent poly or 100% cotton it's definitely a thinner material and it's a little bit more I don't know soft sort a little smoother than the typical 100% cotton shirt but still fit well and fit much better than a lot of the 100% cotton shirts that I own I would definitely prefer this over host now last but not least we have the this one the ocean color it's a sticker no fee yeah the poly blend one didn't come with a sticker these two come with the sticker so I don't know if that was intentional or not but this is the ocean one it's a nice ocean blue is actually pretty fond of this color here oh I think I liked the ocean one a lot better than the blue-jean one if I'm gonna be honest um but one of the other thing I wanted to mention is these this material is not as stretchy as the poly cotton which is to be expected with the poly cotton ones I was able to easily put this over with my hat on these ones the the neckline like it didn't stretch as far and I was having trouble do with that because it is 100% cotton but these are understand cotton ones come in for total colors there's two other colors in this one I think there's charcoal in green is the other one the nice big bright green the charcoal one it's like a charcoal light grayish type of color now before we end the video I do have my two other ones here that I'm gonna open up real quick BAM I magically open them up I'm not gonna throw these on because I don't want to it's more than I have to but here is the purple one same exact concept going on there's not much else to talk about them here it's a basic t-shirt and then that here is the white one oh just a little bit more oh no I just realized the lab Mike I had under here fell down and wasn't pointing in the right direction so I apologize if that audio sounded weird or I don't know how long that was but uh yeah feels like the same material as this tee right here I don't have a like playing white t-shirt to wear at all that's why I wanted to get a plain white t-shirt so there are your branded basic tees you guys are interested in getting any of these they currently have a promo going on where you can get three of them for 40 bucks I think normally they're like 15 apiece you also can get three of these graphic tees for fifty

"naUBCP5_O9A": "look at this side-by-side photo of these\ntwo tees which is better this one is $2.50 and this one is about $3 so which\none do you buy if you knew the cheaper one would shrink after one wash would\nthat affect your decision we're about to unravel the truth behind what makes a\nt-shirt last for the long haul in this episode of our series ask first them but\nbefore we get into it hit that subscribe button unfortunately shrinkage is common with\nfabrics containing cotton unless manufacturers like bellick canvas take\npreventive measures against it the reason natural fibers like cotton shrink\nis because the fibers want to return to their natural state during the fabric\nmaking process when fibers are spun into thread there's a lot of tension put on\nthe fibers and they stretch out beyond their natural length then when fibers\nare warmed by warm water or a hot dryer during the drying process they try to\nreturn to their original state and in turn cause your clothes to shrink the\nreason that more expensive preshrunk cotton does not shrink in the dryer is\nbecause of a process that takes place during the fabric finishing process\nwhich basically gets the fabric to return to its natural state before the\ngarment is sewn with us you want maximum shrinkage of 5 percent while the cheaper\nbrands out there can shrink up to 10 that's basically a hole size we've\ninvested in top-of-the-line equipment that sets the industry benchmark for\nminimal shrinkage first we over stretch the fabric width wise to compensate for\nall the length tension it had in the previous processes next it goes through\nshrink drying chambers in which air blowers tumble the fabric and heat\ntriggers the cotton to revert to its natural state as it shrinks and dries\nthe fabric kind of like a super fancy industrial version of your dryer at home\nthese shrink dryers are a million dollars so it's no wonder mini\nmanufactures skip this step or do their own subpar version of it next the fabric\ngoes through compactor which compresses the length of the fabric using steam\nmaking it physically shorter since the length is where most of the shrinkage\ntends to occur this ensures that when a tee comes to you the fabric has been\nshrunk both lengthwise and widthwise we guarantee a shrinkage rate of five by\nfive meaning the absolute most it will shrink is five percent in both the\nlength and the wet it's always good to leave a little room for shrinkage so you\ndon't have the opposite problem which would be the tee stretching out have you\never had a side seam tee where after a wash that side seam isn't quite on the\nside anymore this happens but non croissant fabric returns to its original\nstate pulling the seam along with it through a\nshrink drying process by stretching and shrinking the fabric\nprior to sewing we eliminate any torque or twisting of the fabric after it's\nbeen washed at home I'm sure if you have a belly canvas tee at home\nyou notice how little it shrinks compared to other brands in your drawer\nthat's because we are the only manufacturer that is invested in\ntop-of-the-line preshrunk dryers like we've just shown you with us we want\nwhat you see to be what you get with no surprises when you take our teas home a\ntea like ours that looks just as awesome after multiple washes as it does right\nout of the box it's just one of the things that separates us from them next\nweek is our last episode of this series and we're talking about the\nenvironmental impact of a t-shirt so don't forget to subscribe Be Different", "QkOiffXudZI": "[Music] [Applause] hey guys I'm Tori with Bella canvas heat press is a really easy technique you can use on all of our products so today we're at stalls the leading manufacturer in the heat press category to show you how to heat press on a few of our top-selling fabrics so we've been doing our YouTube channel for about a year now and get a lot of questions about heat press so can we go back and talk about just the basics of what it is the press is basically a vinyl or a substrate that has a adhesive on the back then you're able to use a heat press and press to a garment so who's most likely to be your heat press customer when you're doing heat press you need to keep in mind that you're going for a low quantity quick turnaround he prefers vinyl doesn't really replace screen printing there so to speak but it does give you that capability of turning around on the spot or within a matter of a couple days what's the difference heat pressing on different types of fabric keep in mind time temperature and pressure is key cotton very resilient so you can use a lot of different times and temperatures with your synthetics you have to make sure your temperatures are on the lower side so you're not scorching that garment are causing and breathing it back so this way and you guys actually did a lot of testing for us on our different products and our different fabrications and we have a whole resource on our website which will include so today I have our 100% heirloom cotton our tri-blend and our Heather CDC so will you take me through the process of how each one keypresses differently absolutely okay so what we're gonna do today on this one on the hundred percent cotton is we are going to quit fashion come on but we're gonna try to keep the lightweight feel of the garment and the light no feel of the application in place so I'm gonna sleeve the garment get it lined up make sure we're on here straight which with the bell of canvas not being tubular sewn it's fantastic it helps us get it lined up there that's better so after sleeve in my garment I'm gonna go ahead and give it a quick press make sure that my temperature is good get all the wrinkles and stuff out of the garment I'm gonna place my fashion film on top make sure it's lined up correctly and what temperature are you doing so fashion film goes on at 320 for 15 seconds and it's a warm peel it will feel hard so next we're gonna do our Heather CDC which is 52% heirloom combed and ring spun cotton and 48 percent poly so how does that different than 100% so here we're gonna put Premium Plus on your product which will enable it to stretch as much as as the garment does and not hinder it it's very lightweight goes on under low temperature and we're gonna keep from scorching the product and can you tell me about the difference between this premium plus versus a fashion faux the fashion film is your all-around product your all-around products gonna go on just about anything and you know not give it a real bit stretch but the price point is correct your premium plus still out a great price point as a premium pride allows the stretch capabilities of the garment we're gonna give this one a couple of seconds before we peel because it is a peel warm to cold I'll peel it off and we're done so again great product stretchable with a good feel so finally we have our tri-blend which is 50% polyester 25% heirloom comes in ring spun cotton and twenty-five percent rayon so can you tell me what is different about this yes your try blends are very very popular and kind of taking over the market so to speak because of the soft feel you get with the synthetics and the rayon in the garment it's it's a fabulous product so with the rayon in in it as a tribal and it makes it very very difficult because the rayon burns and scorch is easier than anything else it gets that soft feel but then again you know we worry about decoration so what we've done today is we've added a lower heating element so we're gonna actually heat it from the lower side or the middle of the shirt and just kind of touch it up on the top so if we do have any scorch you know we do have any problems then it would be on the inside of the shirt and not the outside of the shirt so to speak the temperature on the top we're gonna do it at 250 to prevent that scorching on the bottom we're gonna go up to a full 300 degrees right we're gonna use Premium Plus which is our premium product of course premium shirt premium product this is a warm - a cool peel so I'm just gonna pull it off a little bit because again lower heating element and peel it off so to summarize on our 100% cotton lose the fashionfilm we applied it at 320 degrees for 12 to 15 seconds on the Heather we use our premium plus at 275 degrees for 7 to 10 seconds and on a tribe lens we use our premium plus 300 degrees on the bottom with using our lower heating element 250 on our top heating element for 7 to 10 seconds don't forget

episode of our new printing\nshow here at wekoma with the increase in demand for printed\ncustom apparel and other types of printed goods we decided to create a\nbrand new series where we showcase what today's printers\nare capable of and how your custom apparel business can benefit from them\nso before you go make sure to like and subscribe so you don't miss any of our\nfuture episodes all right with that out of the way let's move on to today's\nepisode in which we are going to be transferring\na design onto a cotton t-shirt using the r550\ntransfer printer and the ricoma flat heat press the r550 white toner transfer\nis a versatile printer that can print full color designs that you can then\ntransfer onto cotton and polyester using a heat press\nand since this is a white toner printer you can actually print bright\nvivid whites on your dark garments also the two-step\nsimply peel transfer media that comes with this printer is a great low-cost\nsolution for high quality garment and textile transfers the sheets have a\nclear coating that protects your printed graphics and prevents cracking when the\nfabric is stretched the transfer sheet is also transparent making it easy to\nposition your graphic correctly on your garment now let's go ahead and get\nstarted all right so let's go over the materials\nwe're going to be using today first up we got our cotton black t-shirt\nthen we have our teflon sheet for our heat press and then here we have the two\nsheets that we're going to be using with the heat press\nand the printer to create our transfer paper so first up we got our transparent\ntransfer sheet this is the one that we print this\ndesign on using the printer and then we combine it with our adhesive\nsheet using our heat press to create our final transfer sheet and\nthen obviously we're using the ricoma r550 white toner transfer printer and\nthe ricoma hp 1515 heat press now the 1515 stands\nfor the surface area of the heat press which is 15 by 15\ninches all right so let's get into the profit potential for these kinds of\nprints so we bought these shirts at wholesale\nat a site called jiffy shirts and they were about 2 dollars and 25\ncents each then the ink and the transfer papers actually cost about\nthree dollars so that puts our entire investment to about five dollars and 25\ncents shirts like these you could sell them\nfor about 15 to 20 dollars so that means that you have a profit potential\nof 9 to 14 around that all right so let's go over to our computer so that we\ncan start printing out our transfer sheet now this software is included with\nthe purchase of the printer like everything else that we're showing\nin this video so if you're interested go down to the link in the description\nall right to do this we are going to be using the icolor pro rip software\nnow in this episode we're really just going to go over an overview of how to\nprint a transfer sheet but in the future we're\ngoing to be making other videos that go more in depth into the software\nso basically all i have to do is grab my design that i already have here on my\ncomputer drag it over to the software and it's\ngoing to appear now all i have to do is wait for the preview to load\nand then i can go ahead and start setting up my project now because of the\nfact that this design was essentially created by a designer\nand it is already created to the dimensions of a regular\nprinter paper of about eight and a half inches by 11 i\nreally don't have to do a lot and in fact the software already puts the\ndesign mirrored so that when i place it on the\nshirt it is in the right orientation all right so since it is already\npositioned where i want it all i have to do is go here select the project\nright click and print all right so i'm going to go ahead and load my\ntransparent transfer sheet onto the printer so that i can print on it\nnow i'm going to be doing that with the matte side up and the glossy side down now as soon as i insert the tray it\nshould already start printing since i already set the design to print\nall right so here we have our hp 1515 heat press now i have the temperature\nset to 310 degrees fahrenheit now before i do any kind of pressing\nwhat i'm actually going to do is preheat the bottom layer of the heat press\nfor about 120 seconds all right so one of the cool things\nabout this heat press is that when the timer is done it'll actually\nautomatically open all right so now that our heat press is\nnice and warm we're gonna take our transparent\ntransfer sheet we're gonna take out the tray and we're gonna put\nour transparent transfer sheet with the glossy side down again\nin the middle of our heat press then we're gonna take our adhesive sheet and\nwe are going to try to place it right in the middle of the transparent\none lastly we're going to put our teflon sheet\nand place the tray back inside of the heat press now we still have our timer\non our heat press set to 120 seconds and we're gonna be going for again 310\ndegrees fahrenheit all right so our heat press is done i'm\ngoing to take out the tray remove the teflon sheet\nand i'm going to peel now the trick is to do it at a consistent rate\nand non-stop and there you have it there's our\ncompleted transfer sheet all right so we're going to take our\nshirt and we're going to place it on the tray of the heat press\nright in the center or as best we can and\nwe are going to press the shirt for about 10 seconds just to remove any kind\nof moisture and wrinkles i'm gonna smooth out the\nt-shirt all right now before i place my transfer\nsheet on the actual t-shirt what i'm gonna do as an added precaution to make\nsure that i don't have any streaks of residue or anything like\nthat what i'm actually gonna do is just cut around my design\nall right so the next part is placing our design on our actual t-shirt\nand for the first time we're actually going to place the design with the\nglossy side up and the reason for this is because\nthe adhesive and the ink is actually on the matte side\non the bottom and that's the part that we want touching the shirt\nand now we're going to place it by measuring about four fingers from the\ncollar and we're going to try to put it in the\ncenter as best we can that looks about good i'm going to go\nahead and grab our teflon sheet i'm just going to place it above\nand we are going to press this at 310 degrees fahrenheit\nfor about 40 seconds so we're done pressing our shirt and\nremove the teflon sheet and we are going to take our shirt with\nthe design and we're going to place it to the side\nto cool down you want to wait about three to five minutes\nall right so it's been a few minutes so let's just go ahead and peel it now in\nmy opinion i think that this is the most satisfying part of the entire process perfect all right so now we're just\ngoing to finish off the process with another press at 310 degrees for\n20 seconds as always put your teflon sheet on top put the tray\nin the press and change my timer to 20 seconds\nand press we're gonna take out the tray peel the\nteflon and that's it there you have the finisher all right and that's it that's how you\ndo a heat transfer using the r550 printer\nand the heat press two-step transfer printing is an easy way to produce full\ncolor designs that can be transferred onto dark cotton tees\nlike this one you can also print designs on hard surfaces like mugs plates and\nbottles the ricoma r550 is the perfect printer for anyone looking to get into\nthe printing business or expand their current product line and if\nyou pair with one of ricoma's high quality heat presses\nyou'll stay ahead of your competition while reaching a wider customer base and\nkeep in mind that we

guilded 500 is our most economical t-shirt meaning if you're looking to get the lowest price possible this may be the shirt for you the pros are it has a wide range of colors it comes in ranges and sizes kids small to adult 5x its tubular constructed meaning that there are no side seams which means that it's a little bit more forgiving and this makes it perfect for promotional items or ordering for large groups where you don't know the different shapes and sizes that are going to be fitting into your shirts the cons are it's not as soft as some of the garments that we offered it has a little bit of a boxy cut to it and it's a hundred percent cotton so when washed and dried on high temperatures it may shrink on our firing soft scale this garment gets a rating of zero", "QqTHaxB8lJE": "hey

here's my monogram what i'm gonna do is just take a piece of transfer tape and put it on my image and i try to use the grid um to get a center line but if you don't it's not you don't have to take my squeegee [Music] [Music] and now i'm just going to lightly and very carefully pull away my transfer tape and i try to hold down the vinyl as i pull just be very gentle [Music] so from here i'm just going to press down my vinyl make sure nothing's sticking up and then we're going to take her outside to bleach all right so i'm outside and i have a piece of cardboard in between my shirt and i'm just going to bleach around my image with 100 bleach until i get the desired effect all right so now i'm just going to take a paper napkin and just dab the vinyl and all the excess bleach that is sitting on it and that's just going to dab it and then i'm going to let it dry and then i'll turn it to the back all right now that it's gotten to a good drying point and it's not going to spread anymore i'm going to take my stencil off and then i'm going to put my shirt into the washing machine you", "p2obXDebFb0": "today I'm wearing the Gildan 5000 hundred percent cotton crewneck the fabric actually feels pretty nice it's definitely a different feel than the Bella canvas shirts that I was wearing earlier but still like nice and soft really durable it feels like a strong shirt that you can kind of wear outside and do some chores with so yeah it's it's a good feel it's uh it's a little restricting on the neck a little bit tighter than I usually wear my shirts but other than that the shoulders are nice and loose nice slim fit down the body the length again just like the the Bella canvas it's a great length shirt it's not going to turn into a crop top and you throw your hands up so you can see myself wearing a shirt basically anytime I'm going outside kind of seems like that like a heavy more durable shirt that I can do some chores nice and baseball I'd say my favorite thing about this shirt is probably just the the durability of it it feels like strong fabric so when I'm out playing pickup football at the beach or something like that it's not one of those shirts that I really have to worry about it's it's inexpensive and it's durable so it's just yeah just gonna be a great outdoor shirt the Gildan 5000 hundred percent cotton tee get it today", "uYIJNPuhr9g": "hi guys it's crystal welcome back to my channel today we're going to be doing a chromoblast t-shirt so i've talked about it for a while i finally got it so some of you guys know that sawgrass has a printer you have sublimation and then you also have chromoblast so i'm finally going to be able to bring you guys some chromoblast stuff and teach you how to use it and what is it today we're going to be making this t-shirt right here and to get that design it's right over here on designbundles.net i'll have this linked below this will be a great item to sell on your website etsy local swap sites right now this is a very popular design and that's why i chose that today all right so let's go ahead and talk about chromoblast and what is it so let's head on over here to heat press nation let me go ahead and tell you guys if it's between november 22nd 2020 through november 30th 2020 right now there is a huge sale going on as you guys know sawgrass hardly ever has any sales um i don't think that i've ever seen a cell so right now the inks are on sale so if you guys already have the printer maybe you guys need to replenish or um you guys want to order some extra inks or anything like that so the sublijet inks are on sale for 65. the caesar ones are 74 but the chromoblast ones that i'm talking about today are 48 the chromoblast inks are way cheaper than the sublimation now what is chromoblast compared to sublimation right you can still get it in the sg500 and the sg-1000 so whichever printer so it's the exact same printer it's just different inks so please note you cannot switch from one ink to the next you have to purchase a separate printer for that so if you're going to have sublimation you'll want a separate printer for your chromoblast chromoblast is for your 100 cotton so this is not going to work for your substrates or anything like that this is going to be only a hundred percent cotton so maybe you want to add something on some you know cotton shoes cotton shirts sweatpants anything like that it needs to be a hundred percent cotton and you can go from light colored fabrics up to some pretty bright ones so we'll get into that um there's tons of videos to come so please uh stay tuned for that you could definitely check out the uh playlist down below if this is a year from now i'll have a ton more videos covering this stuff chromoblast versus sublimation sublimation is it has to have polyester where this one has cotton so the sublimation goes into the shirt it becomes one with it where you can't feel it now this one the chromoblast also goes into the t-shirt but you can feel it so it doesn't set on top like dtg or screen printing but it does have that same feel but it actually goes down into the fibers it if you guys come over here which i'll have these linked down below you guys can kind of come down here and it'll talk a little bit about it it's got vibrant colors um it talks about how it will never fade so the thing about it compared to dtg and screen printing it will never crack or fade it works the same since the sublimation except for you can have feel to it compared to sublimation if that makes sense so if you guys have been wanting to um you know to work with 100 cotton highly recommend you check this out if you guys have been wanting a dtg printer but you can't afford it i highly recommend that you guys check this out so just as as the other one the sg500 is 5.99 the sg-1000 is 1549 and these are going to come with the inks so the thing with this chromoblast just like sublimation has a special paper this is a separate paper you're going to want to use the chromoblast paper so the paper with the ink together is going to make this magic happen all right so let's go ahead and jump right into this video so for today once again i've got my design already brought in here and this is what i like to do everybody asks me all the time how do i size this how do i get it where i want it so say for example today we're using the sg500 i know that i want a full sheet so this is the smaller one you really want to use they recommend over here you really want to use the sg-1000 for t-shirts and stuff so i know for me with the sg 500 i need the full sheet the full eight and a half by eleven so what i like to do is come to blank products and then i just type in 8.5 and i'll go to the 8.5 by 11 and there it is so i can just kind of mess around with it here and get this like a full sheet and if you pay attention over here on the side i have it on inches you can do millimeters or inches you can kind of see that there so i just bring it down a little bit less than the 11 so it'll fit on the page and then center it up you can always use your grid there so you can get it right in the center so you know when you put it down on the shirt it's going to be centered and then when you go to print you want to make sure that it's going to be mirrored and you don't need the bleed lines i'm going to make sure it's mirror when you have the chromoblast printer you don't have all the options like before it's easy peasy it's cotton chromoblast paper you don't have any options color mode you can still choose you've got photographic graphic grayscale or classic i leave it on photographic and then you've got high quality high speed same thing like that at this point it's ready to go i would hit print and send it over to the spm so that's it so let's go ahead and head on over and make a shirt all right so now i've got the heat press ready today i'm using my tea padded so i've got a bigger tea patty here only because this is a small shirt i need to get those seams out of my way because i've got a 15 by 15 press so that's what's going on there and then because i have that pad i couldn't get this to shut i could if i really played around with it but i just thought i'd hold the pressure myself probably a wrong wrong example for you guys but this is only if you have the t padded most you guys probably wouldn't even be doing this but uh here's our design so i've got that printed out now keep in mind with chromoblast you want to work fast so we're sublimation we can print that we can mess with it in a week you know a month from now this you got to do right now there's a whole time on that i'll get the exact timing on that for you guys soon and then i'm going to cover it with a cover sheet so i've got it down i've got my cover sheet and i'm going to push this down i've got it 375 for 30 seconds the cool thing about this it's less heat and less time so i'm giving it like a medium pressure i'm doing it myself because i've got the tea pad it like i said and then quickly i'm going to work fast now the way that you're going to do this is pull your shirt so pull pull pull and it's going to number one help those the ink settle down into the t-shirt and help bring this off because if you guys don't pull this fast enough you guys are going to have almost like a um i'm not explaining you guys will notice on the glasses right here on the right side that little bit almost like it's where it's going to try to peel it off a little bit so work quick just pull and you know pull from the sides pull from the top that's it so i hope you guys enjoyed this i hope you found it helpful if you did please hit the like button down below and subscribe and i'll see you guys on the next one", "do_0E0e1jSs": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to another video i am joy and i'm about to try to use this poly acrylic to supplement on a hundred percent white cotton shirt so i got this polyester from lowe's and it was 17 so right now i'm pouring in one cup of warm water and i'm going to add in uh some of this poly acrylic stuff i have these cups that i got from dollar tree and they are two ounces i had already shake it shook it and mixed it up and right now i'm just mixing it up again and you know just doing what i got so i poured it in the bottle i pulled a little over two ounces in there and i'm going to put the top on it when i can find it and shake it up [Music] [Music] so right here i'm showing you that it is a 100 cotton shirt and it is white and this right here is just a piece of board a piece of um it was a shipping box from united states post service which are free and i just hold it up and put it in there so that's the spray and i'm just spraying it on there just to get it you know a little damp not too damp and i'm showing you the time it is 1203 and when i put it on there and when i came back to put it on there it was 12 i think like 12 26 i forgot to record the time i thought i was recording but i wasn't so right now i'm just preheating the shirt and to get all the moisture out [Music] [Music] right now i'm just waiting for the picture to finish printing off the machine up there it goes and i'm gonna cut around it at first i wasn't but then i changed my mind and started cutting um [Music] and so now i'm just putting it on the press for 60 seconds and we are gonna see what's gonna happen and i'm also tripping on my kids because you know they're my babies all right now here is the big reveal we're gonna swing the arm back and see what happens as you can see i only put two sheets of paper and it's just regular white coffee paper i should have put more but i didn't and as you can see it went through both of the sheets of paper so next time i will probably use butcher paper instead of just plain white cotton paper and let's pull it off and voila this is what you get you guys i'm like super super duper excited and i am in love with the colors and how they popped on this shirt it it just amazes me how it looks and so i'm also going to show you another shirt that i did same process but without that spray that i made same paper same everything same heat press same uh box in this shirt and everything and you'll see how those colors are dull on that shirt but it did work on it but just not as much as the one that popped thank you all so much for watching make sure you subscribe to my channel for more videos i will be doing more crafts and i'm also going to do a updated video on after i wash it to see how it turns out [Music] um", "CDQJcmIwCmI": "hey guys Melissa Harris shirt space here today I solve the age-old question what is better cotton or polyester so sit back and let's get to it [Music] in short the best answer I can give you is it's what you're using it for so now let's dive into a pro and con list kind of like you did with your ex before you broke up with them cotton first cotton is strong and it's soft and has been used since the dawn of time you think that would make it the best but in fact that's not good but let's dive into some more pros cotton is breathable so if Comfort is your number one choice you've found your best match another thing cotton is cheaper but that's only for now cotton is renewable and biodegradable but here's your first con cotton is a very water intensive crop with that said they also rely heavily on pesticides this would move this into the con list for sure however organic cotton has really started to make a play within the industry in the last few years okay let's next touch on polyester polyester is a petroleum-based synthetic fiber aka it's plastic you think this would be a con however in the last couple of years manufacturers have actually started to use recycled bottles to make polyester tees more pros for polyester include that it's durable meaning it will withstand all of that wear and tear polyester also dries quickly wrinkles less and is stain resistant all major pros now for the ultimate plot twist manufacturers have actually started to combine the two making it the goat of blinkx poly cotton blends don't shrink they hold both their shape and their color for extended periods of time they are affordable and they have the softness you want in your favorite team okay we've made it this far and you think you know what T is gonna work best for you but I'm about to throw you the ultimate curve ball now you have to put decoration on your apparel so let's get into it first we're going to talk about water-based inks water-based inks you have to use 100% cotton this also applies to discharged inks as well next let's touch base on plastisol inks with plastisol inks you can use bulk cotton and polyester however with poly and poly blends you'll want to make sure you touch base with the manufacturer to make sure you're good to go in the ink Department when it comes to embroidery you can use both cotton and polyester however just make sure you have the right thread count to make sure your needle will pass through the thread with ease finally heat transfers for vinyl you can use both cotton and polyester however make sure you have the recommended heat settings from the vinyl manufacturer for sublimation we recommend using a hundred percent polyester after all of that I guess we're gonna have to let the debate continue because as you can see it really depends on what you're using the product for but we want to hear what works best for you guys and what is your tried-and-true so give us some comments below to let us know what works best for you thank you guys so much for stopping by to engage in the debate of what is better cotton or polyester if you're looking for more debates like this click that subscribe button turn on your notifications and have a great rest of your day oh hey there thought you'd get rid of me but here I am talking again don't worry you'll only have about five more seconds to pick another video before time runs out look at that one in the top I think that one looks very interesting", "KYJfLETGIj8": "Hey its Tory with BELLA+CANVAS there's a\ntime and place for a nice new t-shirt but we also know it's sometimes hard to\nbeat the feeling of a good old worn in team but what if you could create that\nlook right away without spending all those years wearing it in well today\nwe're a deluxe screen printing to map out the basic steps you need for\ncreating vintage tees so there are a few different types of\nt-shirts and fabrics that work well when going for a vintage vibe poly cotton\nblends and tri blends in particular are great because the yarns take the ink\ndifferently giving it that worn in look today we're going to use our vintage\nslub a fabric with a great tonal texture thanks to the uneven knit to showcase\nthis another great option is to go for a shirt that is pre distressed like our\n3009 from the fast fashion collection this tee is made up of super soft 100%\nairlume combed and ring-spun fabric but features holes throughout for that worn\nin look so the next step is to pair that tee with the right design we've\nconsulted an expert designer Charley Pangus Pangus to showcase how to do just that\nwhat's up guys so for this artwork we wanted to apply a nice vintage look and\nin order to achieve that I needed to find some really heavy textures online\nfor the first texture we use rust and when you apply that above the artwork on\ntop we use the white ink so It blended it right into the artwork it gives it a\nnice broken feel which we love with the vintage look for the second texture\nI like to use an oil splatter and I put that below the artwork which gives it a\neven more broken up look it's also important to note that I applied these\ntextures very very heavy on purpose so when we actually print it and you don't\nlose a lot of detail and then when you actually print it you get this nice\nvintage design that we were looking for and last but not least you're going to\nneed to choose a printing technique that complements both the shirt and the\ndesign so there are two different types of inks that you can use for a vintage\nprint there's either plastisol without a base or water base with plastisol\nwithout a base you typically would like to print on a dark fabric that way your\nbright colors are going to get less bright and they're gonna darken up and\nit's gonna lay right on top of that fabric and you're gonna have a little\nbit of a natural distressed look the other way would be to use water base\nwhich is gonna lay into the fabric and it's gonna have a really soft feel to it\nas if you wash that tee a million times there are two different types of\nwater-based inks there's water base that you're gonna print on white or pastel\ncolors when you're printing on darker colors like blacks reds blues you want\nto go to what's called discharge printing that has a discharge base to it\nwhich actually bleaches out the dye in the fabric with that one it's great for\na distressed looked as well depending on the fabric you're using if you're using\na poly blend it's going to discharge the cotton part of it so that's gonna help\nwith that a little bit of that vintage look\nthank you for going bright it's gonna darken up so be aware with that you\nmight want to do some pre-testing on that because your colors will change now\non 100% cotton that color should be true again you'll want to do some testing on\nthat the two tees that we printed today the distressed tee and the slub tee\nare great options when printing that vintage look let us know what you\nthought of the vintage teens we created in this video in the comment section be\nsure to check out how Charlie completed his design in his video linked below you\ncan also check out the products we featured below as well don't forget to\nsubscribe to our channel for more content like this we'll see you next\ntime Be Different.", "zF8jxGJGCIo": "what is up design family and welcome to another episode of fit design TV so happy to have you here on today's episode we'll be looking at cotton and polyester through the lens of a sportswear designer if you guys are wondering which of the two fiber types is most suitable for a sports or collection watch this video you're gonna find out [Music] welcome to fit design TV on this channel we'll explore what it takes to make it as an active wear fashion brand whilst providing tips tricks and actionable steps towards starting your own product line whether an entrepreneur look at the start your own brand or just someone interested in fitness fashion there's something for you here [Applause] [Music] cotton/polyester are often compared to contrasted just because they're so widely available on the market they're pretty much two of the most popular farmer types when making a selection on what fabrics to make there's a good reason for this and we'll go through it in this video the main difference that you need to know about these two fiber types is that cotton is a natural fiber versus polyester is a man-made or a synthetic fiber that we made in labs and those are pretty much the main core reasons as to what drives their differences we're looking at six different categories in terms of determining which of the two fiber types is most suitable for a sportswear application hopefully by the end you'll be able to make an educated decision on what is right for you we'll be looking at the durability of these two fiber types the temperature regulation of these two fiber types we'll also be looking at the comfort and feel of these two fiber types the ease of maintenance or cleaning the cost associated and last but not least the light weight this of these two fiber types we'll start off with number one the durability the durability has a lot to do with that cotton is naturally occurring and polyester is a synthetic fiber cotton will wear out over time a lot more easily than polyester while you'll notice with a new cotton t-shirt is it's good at retaining its shape up until a few washes at which point it begins to break down from a fiber standpoint it gets a lot more loose it starts to hang loosely it gets a lot softer and this is because it's just much more of a delicate fiber versus polyester which is polymer based it's synthetic fiber it's just going to have a lot more strength into your ability over time it's going to be able to withstand a lot more wear and tear which is important when it comes to sportswear design we're always active we're moving around we're putting our garments through a great ordeal of dynamic activity and our garments need to be able to match our need when it comes to stretch or movement or agility and if cotton is going to wear out over time you're going to notice your garment get looser it's not going to fit as well and it's just overall not gonna perform as well as it needs to perform versus polyester it's gonna go through a lot more wear and tear before it exhibits similar levels of deterioration polyester wins here next is temperature regulation if you know anything about the way that our bodies regulate temperature you know that we spell sweat through the surface of our skin and through the process of evaporation we move away heat from our bodies cotton is breathable which is a win for it in that regard however it absorbs moisture it doesn't wake moisture away from its surface puts it on the skin so what that ends up doing is it prevents the body from allowing sweat to evaporate away from the skin thereby allowing you to feel hotter which polyester doesn't do polyester is more thermal constricting up until a certain point so it'll make you feel hotter and a certain range of temperatures but it will allow you to quick sweat away to the surface of your skin which will allow it to evaporate it won't hold on to that moisture and it won't give you that hot look that cotton is going to do because cotton is just gonna want to absorb all this sweat or first is polyester which is going to wick that sweat away so coffin is much more suitable for neutral climates polyester on the other hand is going to be the more suitable for hot climates where you're going to want to sweat or cooler climates where you're going to want to constrain or restrict the movement of heat away from your body so if you want to look at it cotton is in the middle neutral and then plaster on either sides of the climate scale next we'll look at the comfort and feel comfort of your is a major reason why we select certain fabric and it's no different in this case polyester is known to be a bit more let's just say allergenic when it comes to the way it reacts with people's bodies yes it's silky and it's smooth but it does cause some irritation on a decent segment of the population there are many people that may overcome a certain level of irritation or just an overall mild discomfort with polyester based fabrics that they won't with the cotton content being durable sorry cotton being breathable and cotton being natural it just lends itself to being a lot more suitable for a wider range of skin types so cotton is going to get the edge in this regard cotton is just a generally more forgiving fabric when it comes to skin types and how it meshes with our bodies we also want to look at the ease of maintenance or cleaning like I mentioned cotton is just less durable so it's going to withstand less wear and tear that is afforded by washing whether it's a washing machine or your washing by hand you're going to wear out cotton and faster than polyester polyester though is more prone to deterioration from heat from high levels of heat because it's a polymer based compound it's going to be a lot more sensitive to heat which is also why you can't iron it nor should you iron it but the plus here is that you don't need to iron it whereas caught in wrinkles very easily needs constant care and attention to iron it polyester on the other hand doesn't you just have to be careful not to iron it because you will ruin the garment and not the subject the high levels of heat in a washing machine so it's a give and take here but generally polyesters is going to be easier to maintain over time we want to look at the cost cost is a complicated subject because there are a wide range of different qualities of polyester and cotton but if we're going to be very objective and comparing one to one generally cause it is more expensive than polyester because cotton is a naturally occurring fiber it's limited in our supply - what is available in terms of the agricultural landscape what is the local market able to offer us in terms of raw supply of cotton plant in order to create our cotton fiber needs versus polyester which is a polymer based compound we are able to make it a lot more freely and on our own terms so polyester is going to be cheaper in this regard however you can get better quality of polyester and at the same time you can get a better quality of cotton so it depends it is a give-and-take but I want to one buy a service gonna be cheaper the last is the lightweight nature of both garments hello cotton is more breathable on a meter per meter basis where both fabrics have the same thickness you're going to notice that polyester is going to be significant more lightweight again it is because of the fact that this is a synthetic fiber we're able we were able to create it and as lightweight a case as we can polyester generally is much more lightweight than cotton so for sure if you're going for a lightweight fabric and you want to have some thickness to it you want to go with polyester versus cotton that being said both fabric types or fiber types do have their applications in different cases but we generally do recommend polyester when looking at a core fiber type to incorporate your collection coffin is great for a certain level of tops or lightweight garments that you want to have in a situation where you want to have a natural fiber of your collection but for more of your heavy duty core essential garment types you want to look at polyester because it's going to perform in a way that is a lot more analogous with the needs of sportswear design hopefully guys that makes sense we've also done a video on polyester versus nylon because those are both synthetic fibers that often get compared we give you our verdict on that one highly recommend you check it out if you want us to compare and contrast any other fiber types leave it in the comments below we always love making these videos for you guys if we missed on anything again in the comments below thank you so much for tuning in to fit design TV until next time sails", "9Ra1fswSqJE": "hey there in today's video I'm gonna show you how I use my Sawgrass creative studio software I'm going to grab an old file that I do need to press print and press on 100% cotton shirt and most of you already know that sublimation you cannot print on 100% cotton shirts but there are several ways to accomplish that my favorite one is a powder process which I'm going to show you today so I'm gonna go ahead and log on to my Sawgrass software and it's called okay I'm gonna launch it and right now it's gonna it's gonna ask me what blank design I want and I'm just gonna click Next and I'm looking for I'm gonna do a letter size US letter ate nap by 11 next it's always gonna be white sublimation there is no white so you can start with just a blank canvas and I'm gonna be printing a vertical I mean there's that on the vertical image map 11 so I'm going to start my designer I'm gonna go to my designs and I'm gonna pull an old image there's a lot of stuff I've done since I've had this sucker software for three years I guess anyway so it's perfect if I would have added too much white that would have literally see that cut into that so you don't ever want to save an image with too much white up here you know it's not gonna print but still if you covered that that's exactly what's gonna print it's gonna cut that ringside off so I'm not so I don't want it don't know what the gloves too big because it's gonna this is gonna be a crossing chest so I want it maybe maybe five inches right here it tells you it's five by I'm sorry seven by seven right now I want it maybe five inches so that it doesn't look too too big there's a shrink this too much so let's just say about five inches okay so it's five inches squared actually this is gonna be on an excel shirt let's say for next so this is an eight nap I live in print maybe we can be seven inches just go back to other seven inches let's do six and a half up here on the left corner to telling me like what the image size is okay so here's where you see the white those are called bleed lines you don't want to go over or put you don't want your image in there and it's gonna cut off you're literally gonna cut off your image it's kind of a guideline not to go over so let's do that but this is close to the top as possible do you see the bleed lines right here you don't want your image or wording in there and I want to make this as white as possible I'm staying away from the big line if you look up here hopefully you can see it so this is gonna go on an excel shirt just solid white I kind of want to make this bigger but I want this to be across the chest I thought about doing I thought about doing this making this um heat transfer vinyl so that I can make it bigger which I probably should but it's two different processes and for a freebie you don't want to spend too much time on on this process I can make it wider to make it more pronounced again I'm trying to get avoid the bleed lines if you want please comment down below your thoughts I'm just playing around with the I think that would look okay I already have one printed it was my very first one I think I don't remember what happened but somewhere along the line the I mean I didn't place the the image correctly and when you're using powder for your pressing your print on your press you have to be really careful once you place it because once you put it down because it's powder that it's soaking up the ink once you put it down that's it you have to leave it down or it's gonna mess up your humor process I think I want to leave it like that I think that looks looks okay maybe shrink it just a little bit maybe let's make it six inches I'm just trying to imagine what it will look like on an XL shirt normally I would put it that close but again we're working with a freebie right now just for the guys just gonna be using it for boxing boxing shirt okay so let's say we want to Center it I'm gonna highlight both click on object and align Center right so it's a line now so okay now so now what I'm going to do is I've been imprinted on sublimation I'm sorry the powder comes with its own toilet tone paper from SEPs and I'm gonna show you that process now I'm getting ready to print that first I want to show you I put my process my powder in this in this container it's uh it's a one and a half gallon Rubbermaid container and we're gonna have it this big is because I want to be able to fit my paper like at 1111 an 11 inch by 17 inch is the longest either way I want to I want enough room to put the paper in there and I'll show you what I'm going to do they look they did their paper just so that people know which side to print on this one had a little wine on it probably cut that out I'm gonna go ahead and use this I'll just cut that out if I don't need it and I'll show you what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go ahead and stick this in mind this is my soccer X it's 200 try to face down let me stick them on print the image you do have to select which paper and because it does not give you an option for four steps in a virtuosic creative studio I've been choosing the option of I still select you know sub products and for the paper I just pick a key plot no idea what that is to be honest but it works and I keep it on high quality waiting for it to print I don't need that much powder this is gonna be plenty usually there comes a little baggie like that I don't put it back I just close the seal the literally tightly and I just leave it there until the next time I use it because ink is what if you touch it you're ruined the print so do not touch the ink just be careful and just hang on to it just just grab the edges and avoid touch them to eat I learned the hard way okay so what I'm gonna do you can still wet now grab to eat the paper and just slowly just move the the powder in there grab the ends and I'm just gonna kind of sway back and forth so there's one one time and then I did one last time and that's it I just tap it just like that I also have this little comb brush that I bought just to get any excess powder because you will have to put it under the your heat press for about 30 seconds to secure it so I'm gonna do that process now okay for the temperature settings they have to be 375 Fahrenheit 30 seconds since it's fresh off the press and still wet when you use a piece of parchment paper because there is gonna be powder in the back and that's what the brush silicone brush was for but I went ahead and use my hands just to get any excess out and I'm just gonna set it down I'm waiting for the temperature to get to three seventy-five once that's once I've reached that temperature I mean just let it hover over the image and just let it cure for 30 seconds and then from there I'm going to show you the the pressing process I didn't mention you have to use moderate pressure and it is for 30 seconds once you've done that you have to it's a cold pill so you have to wait about 40 seconds before you remove the transfer so I wanted to add that really quick before I forget this shirt appears a medium-sized shirt this was the very first shirt I print a while back I mean it's then it has been a good maybe a couple years and I can't see it and I want to take this shirt off but I have this as my sample for evening for showing people the sublimation to cutting process which is this powder process I somehow didn't place it correctly and it's it's kind of off in some areas but here didn't pick up the ink and that's why I decided to just keep this I used a sharpie pick just for so looking for display I don't know if you can see about you'll be able to see once I show you now use a sharpie see the black mark I just did that because I wanted to keep it for Show and Tell for sublimation to patent that's why I still have this plus it looks good I mean it's good to have shirts for your process for show-and-tell not what people can see the different processes that you know I would turn the camera but I don't want to have to I'm using the octopus one and I won't have to readjust it but eventually I'll show you all the shirts that I have them hanging on the walls that I use a show and tell the pressure is already at 6:56 362 which that's hot enough so for now I'm just gonna go ahead and cure my in so again it has to hover for about 30 seconds to let it cure and all it's doing is just keeping the moisture it's removing moisture and it's also curing the ink with the powder and you can feel it you can't feel it it really just feels like heat transfer vinyl okay that's about 30 seconds I didn't really count maybe about five more seconds okay so it's out don't touch it I wish I had a handle to do this I'll bring it in close I don't know if you can see it but it's kind of got a like a velvety kind of look to it I would say feel but you can't feel it but he's got a velvety look to it and if you remember a little while ago I mentioned that it had a little smudge or something on I'm gonna go to cut that out I don't want that to end up on my shirt so I'm just gonna cut it out and I'm fixing to I'm fixing to go ahead and take the moisture out of my t-shirt these are white of course this I'm gonna go into these my lint roller you still have to be careful not to touch touch the the image same thing [Music] try not to be camera I'm using a Hanes t-shirt turn it to the camera too much it's gonna move the moisture out of the t-shirt my my my tripod broke my big one my 50 inch tripod it broke got the pressure too hard I'm gonna go ahead and find my center line I'm gonna fold it in half vertically just suck and create my center line my image and I do have this and one of my videos how to find your center line has a kink in there and trying to get out I don't want that I want to get him as far as possible like I did something wrong sorry I know I'm off-camera just trying to find my centerline doesn't let me take this long and also when I look at when I'm you trying to find my centerline the caller when we slowed it in half you can feel the caller I always put the collar off of the edge of the heat press only because I don't want the I don't want the collar imprinted on the on the [Music] on the other side of the shirt if that makes any sense okay that's good for now just going to apply the pressure line to close it just to avoid the camera being so shaky okay now on you can't you can't find the you can't bend it like you normally would he transfer vinyl there you know you pinch the top and the bottom but you can't do it on these because you know you don't want to ruin the the image because it's powdered so what I've been doing there's my centerline look you can see it there you go there's my centerline and again this is an XL shirt I'm gonna do four inches I'm just gonna put a little indention with my nail and I'm gonna get the color off the press or the Putney so what I do because this is I know this is eight at eight and a half by eleven I just find the four and a half inch mark with my ruler or my tape measure normally what I do and I do this way before time I just get it like an exact don't know if you can't use a pen or marker of course you don't want that on his shirt I just he's a either an exacto knife or I'll just mark it with the scissors I know it seems like a lot of different steps but for me it's worth it I'm just gonna make a little make a little mark with my scissors again the wrong reason I'm doing that is because I don't want to touch it and I'm just gonna make little Mark's and just to show you my markers right there my scissor mark so four and a half inches plus another one of inches actually I'm more fiction is I don't wanna to off okay so right there right there right doesn't have to be perfect but that's just me okay and the reason you want to do this is because it's powder once you put it down that's it there's no turning back but regardless I still love this process because I'm able to print on one or any cotton-blend shirt okay so I've got my mark I'm gonna line these up with the center line that I created okay so once they're fine cinnamon I just drop it very carefully and I do use um parchment paper for this for sublimation you do not want to use Teflon sheets because it will pick up any of the ink and I will you will transfer that to your next substrate so I always use parchment paper when I'm working with sublimation okay so we're gonna do 30 seconds and then we have to wait 40 seconds before we can remove the transfer to the transfer paper so we have about seven seconds left if you want to share what process you use for sublimation please drop that below so we can share information maybe I can give you some tips that you have any questions please feel free to drop your questions down below you have to wait 40 seconds I'm not gonna need this because that's the cup steps instructions I'm gonna wait about 40 seconds turn it's been 40 seconds and it is Coquille I hope you can see this I want to call the image when I press it one more time just so I can remove these lines this is a civil mission - cotton okay I hope this video was helpful feel free to ask questions and I look forward to producing more videos for you thank you for watching until the next time", "Kw5NZnJeOBM": "[Music] do [Music] hello guys welcome back to my channel this is my sugary lovecraft and today i'm going to be doing a test uh with dye sublimation ink i'm also um going to be testing it on not 100 polyester but 65 cotton 40 polyester and then what i'm also going to be doing is i'm going to be testing it out on three different types of paper i'm going to be testing it out on 20 pound paper and of course you know like i said i printed it with the dye sublimation ink i'm going to be print i printed out also on the sublimation paper as well as you can see tell the difference and i've also printed it out on 28 pound laser paper now this should not be working according to um you know what they say about sublimation ink um they should not be able to transfer to cotton shirts without adding or removing the coating with a certain type of um formula but let's try it out let's see what's going to happen um i've already heated up my um piece of material like i said it's only 65 cotton 40 polyester i'm gonna put a sheet of paper underneath just because like i said i'm just doing a test and i don't want it to bleed through because i'm not sure what it's going to happen so this is live i'm going to put this sublimation shout out to my jamaican family now it's mirrored so that's why i can't tell what it really says um so i'm gonna put the sublimation paper at the top then we have the 20 pound below 28 pound below and then followed by the 20 pound all right um i've already heated up my shirt but you know what let me heat it up again just to make sure to take that moist just out double check and i'm just gonna heat it up for a little bit all right um let me go ahead and place these back on there exactly in the same order that i talked about and what i'm going to do is i'm going to tape it down just so that it won't shift or move of course i didn't line it up you know real neat because that's not the purpose the purpose is to see if it's true that only the sublimation ink is going to i mean the sublimation paper is going to transfer to the material and also to test to see if it does work on not 100 polyester all right i don't know i just don't like polyester shirts they just look shiny to me but let's see why not let's try it out all right and i'm also going to take some black sheets of paper um and put it on the top as you can see i've already have my teflon sheet on the top here so i'm gonna still use just in case it's gonna bleach okay all right here we go i'm gonna be putting it down for 60 seconds now according to um like i said um it's stated that you cannot use um the dye sublimation on cut on cotton it should only be on polyester and that it has a special coating that releases the ink into the shirt um of course the other two paper that i have which is a 28 pound and the 20 pound copy paper um they don't have any special coding so let's see first of all it should be blank when we lift this up because apparently it shouldn't be working on cotton right or not blank but it should be totally faded um on all three so let's see what happens so as you can see the ink so i'm glad that i did put something over it the date the ink did come through on the 20 pound paper it didn't come through that much just a little bit on the 28 pound paper and of course nothing on the sublimation so let's go ahead and kind of take it off wow looky here [Music] wow so i honestly i'm not buying any more from sublimation paper i could buy a pack of 20 pound paper 20 pound paper and make a brighter color i'm like look at it it is i mean awesome i mean even on the the 28 pound itches it is much brighter than the sublimation paper that i paid 17 for wow and like i said it's not 100 cotton it's um 65 it's not 100 polyester 65 cotton 40 polyester um i cut it from this shirt and i'm just going to show you exactly what it says 60 60 cotton 40 polyester and guys as you can see so for those of you guys who are out there doing um dye sublimation just make sure you test it out because this is awesome i love it once again thank you for watching my channel this is miss sugee lovecraft don't forget to like subscribe and share [Music] you", "vkCnjUqdlq4": "I'm starting a t-shirt line what's the best shirt to use I can honestly say this is the number one question I get asked to answer that you have to consider what is most important to you about your brand what people starting a t-shirt line usually care about the most is fit feel fashion and how they can be decorated so let's see if I can answer that number one question for you up next [Music] hey guys it's melissa my shirt space when it comes to finding the best t-shirt to start a t-shirt line what you'll first want to consider is your brand's aesthetic if you feel like your brand is more about the design than the shirt I would consider using the g500 okay what I'm referencing here is brands that tend to be about funny slogans or silly images personally I wouldn't consider a brand like this to be a fashion-forward brand so what classic tubular team might be your best bet but I'm guessing that people watching this video are more interested in starting a fashion-forward clothing brand when it comes to a fashion-forward clothing brand that appeals to all genders I can definitely give some more recommendations and again we will want to touch on what matters most fit feel and fashion let's start with fit this is a big one everyone wants to look good and feel good but plains of both genders can be hard this is where manufacturers have stepped up to create the retail unisex team this slim-fitting tee that caters to both genders will be a hit for sure next let's touch on feel a soft comfortable tea will be something that your customers will not forget so this is where fabric comes into play there are three recommendations I would make on fabric the first is cotton the second is CVC and the third is try blend let's talk a hundred percent cotton 100% cotton is a tried-and-true tea it's only downfall is that it will shrink after its first wash but if you provide your customers with the correct wash instructions to follow they will be sure to fall in love next up is CVC cv c stands for chief value cup this refers to the cotton poly ratio within the tea with a heavy percentage of cotton these teas provide the softness of the cotton and the durability and texture of the polyester finally we have our try blends this is a blend of 50% poly twenty-five percent cotton and 25% ring a triflin is very similar to a CVC but with an added feature you have your softness of your cotton your durability and texture of your polyester but then with that round you also get some added features these fabrics all have a very price point depending on where you'd like to be for your customer base okay let's talk fashion a huge trend in the fashion world right now is street wear so how does this apply to choosing a teeth well the unisex tee is one of the hottest things in the street wear market right now so you should definitely consider everything that I've touched on when choosing your fashion-forward teeth but I know what you're thinking WTF I just wanted her to tell me the answer well it's your lucky day here are my top picks or starting a t-shirt line first we have the Bella canvas 3001 seat this is a 4.2 ounce hundred percent cotton retail fit the shirt comes in a number of amazing colors and also has a tearaway label and it also comes in a CTC option next up we have the n62 10 by next level this shirt is made up of 60% cotton and 40% polyester it's a 4.3 ounce and comes with a tearaway label as an added bonus now for our tribe ones first up we have the tr4 o1w weighing in at a 3.7 ounce making it a great lightweight option finally we have my personal favorite it's the three four one three seat by bella canvas it's a three point eight ounce retail fit with unisex sizing side seams and a tearaway label oh and it's also preshrunk what's not to love well there you have it guys my thoughts on the best t-shirt to use when starting a fashion-forward t-shirt line as always thank you guys so much for stopping by and watching our videos if you have a

above me want me to answer all of your questions but it's above me now some of my followers may know mcdonald's is just place i love going to go there all the time mainly because i'm super broke i mean not that bad but i want to save my money for other stuff you know some different things and that mailman salary you know it's not that high you know you don't make a whole lot of money being a usps male delivery person which that's what i'm doing right now i am painting shirts that's why i got the noah shirts those 100 recyclable check those out i want to paint on those like i painted on this one this is my most recent you guys like that graphic got a bunch of detail in there and then with my noah tees i'm going to make them real crisp i've been letting the paint kind of bleed around the edges on these organic tees that i've been using got a couple i've painted over here but anyways uh let's break into these travis shirts because you know there's a bunch of cactus jack fans out there we're gonna check them out one at a time let's see oh this is the cactus mac shirt that one actually sold out pretty quickly or they just took it off the website i don't know and then we have our action figure on the back shirt and then we have our action figure on the front jack smile t-shirt too what is this one action figure series t okay so just comes in this shipping bag with a paper receipt and then all of them are totally sealed in their plastic all of them are size large oh wait this one's a medium this one's a large this one's a large i got one medium and two larges okay well this channel's purpose right now anyways the main focus is to check out some dope street wear some hype street wear brands and things like that some ethical streetwear is what i'm getting been trying to get into more so make sure you subscribe hit that like button for me and we'll check out the stickers on this plastic here there's that medium-sized one and we got the two large t's right there and then on the back there's a bunch of warning information they're all the same but yeah this has been written over and over and over again there and so i'm actually probably most excited for this purplish colored one it's kind of purplish right it's called berry i mean it's kind of a cool tie-dye name for it if you call this tie-dye i guess i will call it tie-dye yeah definitely here is cactus jack size large he does have a bunch of puff print all over here it's kind of a mix so you got this uh elephant print back here that doesn't really have much print to it but the jack on here loads of it and then you can't even read the cactus because his action figure is over top of it but under here it says cactus tell him jack sent you there we go and then we have our giant cactus jack whoa come on and then we have our giant cactus jack logo on the back here all in puff print barely legible because they like did a bunch of effects to it to make it really blotchy or whatever so you can kind of tell that this k is amazing that's a great k i gotta say or what about this s down here look at that s just a mean come on and this u easily you can tell that to you right i can't quit hating on what they did with that logo but it's kind of cool how they just kind of meshed it up there and then what do you think about this bluish turquoise color against this berry purple do you like that color combination there i don't know it's not too bad they seem like inverted colors and then on here you have this lime yellowish green lots of yellow in this lime green but then you can tell it's not quite yellow because the orange in this mcdonald's this yellow in here this orange really makes you see that this other text has a little bit of green tint to it yeah they went for a lot of 90s vibes with this tee you can really tell with that scribbling down there that's really common in the 90s in this elephant print obviously as well and yeah so enough talk let's look at the tag on the back of the neck there it is coming up for you this one here is a size large it's a standard size large american standard size large nothing special i ordered a bunch of these tees and uh just gonna start painting them you guys can order them from me for sure so just reach out to me tell me you want a tea created with my with my current uh expression of art put a couple colors together and get you sent out that team let's check how the travis scott large fits comparatively and yeah i feel like this one fits basically the same basically exactly the same as that last t i was just wearing what do you guys think you guys think they're about the same size i would say this is just a standard size large american maybe a little bit longer but i mean a quarter of an inch or something that could vary from piece to piece and you got the back graphic on there as well being loud and bold colors are all over the place and yeah let's get into these organic or 100 recycled cotton tees repurposed cotton looks like noah is not doing any additional packaging in here to keep the t-shirts free of any dust or debris that might get inside the bag these ones i did buy size extra large for seed and so yeah no plastic on these ones they just come out with their tag on there and yeah this cotton it actually doesn't feel too terrible it does have markings on it just like some little markings here and there because uh they didn't put any plastic they just put it in the shipping bag and i don't know you can't really tell that much but there's definitely some dirt yeah so this tea definitely feels really rough you can see a lot of texture in there there's some variation to how this looks it's super pilly already it's got little black specks all over a few little pilly black specks here and there and you do have the noaa logo down at the bottom corner right down there bottom left and then up at the top i'll zoom in for your tag here you guys can check this tag out there it is just safety pinned on we got this logo here and on the inside left you do have this wash tag yeah so there's a little bit of a message on the bottom of this noah t very sad message but you know sometimes truth hurts it says at least 40 million pounds of plastic has accumulated and is floating in the north pacific ocean so this tea is trying to help reverse that the noaa brand is really trying to help reverse that that's probably the main reason why in here they did not put any plastic casing on anything oh look a sticker here we go we got a sticker and it is a transparent one i think it's a transparent sticker whoa is there two stickers here there's totally two stickers here yeah hey they're almost stuck together got two noah stickers yeah this snow brand is just headed in a great direction a direction i myself i'm really trying to head towards i know i'm still kind of torn i'm still kind of in two different worlds with trying to have ethical street wear and then also you know the hype streetwear that has really drawn me into the whole culture and even educated me on a lot of things and really opened my mind to discover different truths that are basically things that i thought were true but ended up just being false or just being a theory there's a lot of theories out there things that can't be proven a lot of people are taking as a hundred percent truth really what i want to get back to is just caring about every single living thing or when i get to i don't think the world has ever been in a place where it cares about every living thing maybe i mean i tend to think a lot of the indigenous people of the americas were very conscious about the earth and about each other and and respect and things like that then humans had to come in and do what they do best and you know whoever is the dominant figure their way of life wins out so really that's something we can be conscious about all the time just be thinking about our footprint what are we doing how are we leaving this earth what are some practical steps we can individually take to just make this world a better place make it a more joyful place and just make it so that we can flourish as a society without taking advantage of other species of life out here on this planet and so that's basically my positive message for today just really want us to be conscious every single decision matters everything you say even matters you know i'll be debating with my family about different religious things i'm really into theology and philosophy and they're really strict and convinced of the status quo christian but then i'm more questioning all these structured things that christianity has laid out and i'm just not falling for him anymore i just i just think it was set up for governments to be able to rule people and to create complying citizens and i'm complying yes i mean i'm an artist i'm just out there i change things up i want things to be different so anyways let me know what you think about this e-conscious shirt this organic cotton tee that i painted up here with that graphic you know the continents the whole earth matters right and then also if you were into the cactus jack and mcdonald's gear i have more stuff coming i don't know if any of you guys got the email but i definitely did i got the email from travis saying that it's going to be like three and four weeks further out than was originally expected it's just yeah it's going to take forever apparently i guess they're just blaming it on coven that's what you gotta do just blame everything on call of it because it's making everybody slow down and making businesses timelines all messed up i mean i'm currently working on trying to get a trademark and then i'm going to get a utility patent and then the design patent because me and abby i told you guys a few weeks ago if anybody's been following that we've been working on a special project or i've been working on a special project with her and we put a lot of time effort energy into that creating this baby of ours we invented a really cool game that you play at the table not on a computer it's kind of vintage right but uh hopefully once i get the trademark done i can show it to you guys i'll have my patent pending i can start selling it and just have different people be playing this game it's really fun i really enjoy it i brought it over to a ton of different people's houses and i played it a bunch with them they all really love it they want me to market it so i'm going to go after it and we'll see what happens i mean i just want to spread joy and some cheer to people and i feel like playing a game with your family definitely has a possibility or potential of springing up some joyce bringing up some happiness i mean that's why people play games just uh just to get to know the other people that you're playing with and to grow some relationships it's what i'm all about that's why i started this channel we can start some relationships i'm up here in montana nobody around here is a hypebeast nobody nobody's a streetwear enthusiast i mean there's probably a few but i'm not connecting with them and most of them are are playing a lot of video games i'm more of this artist type this industry where so it's i don't know i'm just a weird individual and i think that's okay i think god is okay the creator of this whole carbon-based universe i think he's okay with us being diverse and being different so i encourage everybody out there to go after your dreams go after the things that you're ambitious for cause uh only thing holding you back is probably you i mean just saying so anyways uh i love you all and i hope you stay safe out there until next time peace [Music] [Music] right now", "C9sOKtCWbX8": "hey y'all um i'm here today to answer a question that many of you had um the question was should you subliminate before you bleach or after your bleach now there is um several ways that people do it some people prefer to press their sublimation on which if you're pressing on a darker like a gray shirt like this you're not going to see it real well it's going to kind of blend in here so they would press it on and then once you bleach it it kind of the design kind of becomes visible um and that works just fine however it does cause severe fading in my opinion the other way is to bleach a spot on your shirt um i actually have some of my dryer right now i forgot about um bleach your shirt and then after it's um washed and dried sublimate onto that shirt um after that and the different the major major difference that i have noticed is let me show you my two different designs here two methods i did same design two different methods this one has a definite more vintagey look this one i had subliminated first and then i bleached so you can see the design is kind of faded and that's because this is 65 poly and 35 percent cotton so once you wash it the design is going to fade the bleach makes the design fade the sun makes the design fade um all that so i have had much better results with bleaching first and then sublimating the design right on top of it um doing it this way is a little more work however it's worth it in my opinion i can do a side by side of the shirts um the only issue i've run into is not knowing exactly how big or how small that design is so you're kind of guessing when you're like spraying your bleach on not exactly knowing you know okay is this going to be too big of a spot is this going to be too small of a spot so you're kind of stuck guessing um let me go here and flip the camera and show you them side by side so obviously uh bleached first bleached second so there you have it um i mean some people get great results this way this is just my personal review my personal opinion and yeah i hope y'all have a wonderful sunday", "w5OhPcFHbu4": "What\u2019s up everybody!

technical and basic tees from uniqlo i have a handful of uniqlo tees that i've been wearing for more than a year and they've held up really great this particular shirt it's the alexander wang aries mt collab that they did a while back and it's held up absolutely great so i did notice that uniqlo added some more colors and a couple different cuts of the arizona tea to the website so i thought i would go ahead and pick some up just because there's such a good basics and i also picked up two supima cotton tees from there because i wanted to try those out and then each t-shirt i'm going to show you guys i'm going to give a sizing reference for them because it's a different cut or it might be a different size or anything like the supima cotton teeth i got one in a large one in medium and then i would showcase the different styles of other t-shirts as well i'm gonna go ahead and talk about what makes arizona so special so if you want to skip that skip to this time right here to go ahead and get to the t-shirts and if you want to see how i style it with some very simple fits go ahead and skip to this time right here by the way if you guys are into fashion at all i highly recommend you pick up a tape measure it just makes buying clothes online so much easier it just makes buying clothes online a little bit more worry free because you can measure the clothes based on the size charge to something else you already have in your collection just for a sizing reference i also sell stuff on grailed and this comes in really handy just to give a potential customer an idea of the size of the garment i'll go ahead and link a super cheap version of this down in the description below highly recommend it so four out of the six shirts i'm going to be showing you today are the airism fabric which does have a lot of cool technical features in it such as it's anti-wrinkle especially after washing it's antibacterial just to help stop odors it's cool to the touch and of course it's quick drying and very breathable as well really interesting feature that they have with some of the uniqlo errorism tees are that they are uv protectant so i wanted to look into that a little bit more to see like kind of what that was and i couldn't find anything super concrete on what they do to errorism to make it more uv protectant than a normal piece of clothing but i did find some general information on the internet regarding uv protective clothing and then taking the knowledge from there and then comparing it to what uniqlo does release you can kind of theorize on what they do so basically darker colors protect you a little bit better than lighter colors the denser the weave of the fabric obviously the more protection you're going to get from the sun which is pretty intuitive you know if you have a fabric that's super tight it's not going to let as much sun get through treatment and dyes can be added to a fabric to either reflect or absorb uv rays i suspect this is what uniqlo does with their arrows and tees because aerism is a very breathable fabric so it does let air through so it's not super dense they do say on the tag of some of the errors and tees that uv filtration has been added to the fabric to a rating of upf 40 plus which i looked it up and that rating means it blocks 97.5 or greater of the uv rays shiny polyesters and satin silk type fabrics do a really good job of reflecting uv rays as well which i think this plays into airism because depending on the t-shirt it's either 27 to 47 polyester however these heirism shirts don't really have like any shine to it like with a lot of athletic tees so they're all really subtle and look nice for just everyday wear anyways enough of that i'm gonna go ahead and get into the t-shirts so the first one i got this is the uniqlo u arizum oversized boxy tee and this one is definitely the most unique cut of all of these shirts i was going to get this back when the uniclo u collection initially released but upon the day of release there must have been some logistical error because it wasn't available until like a week or two later so then i just kind of missed out on it but luckily they are still in stock the thing i like most about this tee are the elongated sleeves they come about right up to the elbow and it does have the dropped shoulders and a much tighter collar than a standard t i mean it's not like too tight where it's uncomfortable but it is a little bit more snug up so it does have a very unique silhouette i think this looks really good with like some techier fits maybe some pairs of pants that are a little bit wider or a little bit baggier just to kind of match the oversized proportion of the top this does come in a lot of different colors but i opted just for black just because it is more of a unique cut of tea so i just wanted to play it safe and go with a subtle black instead of a really bright color but again that's just my subjective style opinion because this is oversized i did size down to a size medium now just looking at the size of this tee here the rough measurement shoulder to shoulder which i measured from the hem to the hem it's 52 centimeters or like 21.5 inches and then the total length from top to bottom is about 70 centimeters or like was that like 27.5 inches i think and then the shoulder to the end of the sleeve is 26 centimeters or like that's like 10 and a half inches i think so it's definitely pretty boxy um however the the shoulders are like i said earlier the drop shoulder so they are supposed to go off your shoulder so that's why it's so wide in those measurements but again that's a size medium for wrestling i did pick up one of the basic airism cotton crewneck short sleeve t-shirts and this is just a normal cut t-shirt that i picked up in this really nice dark gray and this dark gray in the arizona fabric kind of gives off a really cool kind of industrial metallic metal like vibe to it that's kind of weird to say but i don't know it has a more athletic cut to it but it's not too slim and they do have normal length sleeves but a lot of times with my t-shirts i do like to cuff it two times just to make my t-shirts fit a little bit better or maybe subconsciously i'm trying to make my noodle arms a little bit more buff looking i don't know i did get this in a size large and the rough measurements of this are shoulder to shoulder it's 47 centimeters or like 18.5 inches total length from top to bottom is 71 centimeters or like 28 inches so again a little bit longer than the boxier cut one and then the sleeve length unrolled of course it's about 22 centimeters which is like nine inches right right now it's just kind of wrinkled because it came packaged up all folded up really close so i'm trying to get that out of here so the next two shirts are of the same cut these are the arizon uv protectant long sleeve and these are an online exclusive so i got one in black just to play it safe can't go wrong with a very basic black tee and i also got this one in dark gray which it almost kind of has like a brown hue to it depending on the lighting in this camera it does look pretty gray um but in some lighting it does kind of give off some brown undertones which i think is really cool and i think this one might be my favorite tee of this whole like mini haul but it has a really nice earthy tone to it it's very classic fit but it's not too boxy being a basic long sleeve there's not too many cool features with this but there are like a small slit on the sides of the waist and then of course you have a nice cuff and collar as well i did get both of these in a size large and the rough measurements from shoulder to shoulder are is 47 centimeters which is like 18.5 inches the total length is 72 inches or 28 inches just like the last tee and then the sleeves are 58 centimeters which is about 23 inches these errors and teeth just have like such a great feel they feel so comfortable and i really really like the texture of it as well it's not too shiny and soft kind of like more typical workout gear but it still remains to be very soft and kind of a soft like cool touch to it but anyways lastly i did pick up two supima cotton basic tees and i am quite impressed with the feel and quality of these t-shirts now just comparing the supima cotton to a standard cotton tee from uniqlo is the supima cotton tee is noticeably more soft and it almost feels like errorism it's so smooth whereas the other one it's a little bit more coarse and granded this one is older but if you're thinking about getting one of the t-shirts i would just go ahead and opt and pay more for the nicer quality tea so anyways i did get these in two different color ways i did get one in a dark green and then the other in a dark brown now the dark green is a size large and the brown is a size medium this season they did design these to be a little bit of a looser fit just so it drapes more on the body both the green and the brown do have undertones of gray in it which makes it very very wearable just for every day and then being 100 con these are much more of a matte color than the arizontes not that the arrows and tees are shiny at all these are just noticeably more of a matte color so the large measurements are roughly 44 centimeters from shoulder to shoulder or that's like 17 and a half inches total length is 71 centimeters or like 28 inches and the sleeves are 22 centimeters long which is like eight and a half inches now comparing that with the size medium tee the shoulder to shoulder width is 47 centimeters or 17 inches so you lose about a half inch in width so the total length is 68 centimeters or 27 inches so it's an inch shorter than the large roughly speaking and then the sleeves are 20 centimeters so it's straight eight inches so not too much more terribly small than the large but it is noticeable and in hindsight i probably would have got both of these any size large just because i like a little bit more of extra room in my teeth just so it drapes a little bit nicer on the body and it's a little bit more comfortable anyways here are some outfits that i put together with these again very simple because all these tees are really great basic building blocks to construct an outfit off of so i kept everything very simple and with the aries mts i put together very basic like techware fits whereas the supima contest put together very basic street road looks but anyways here they are [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i will go ahead and link all the t-shirts i got down below in the description i do use an affiliate link it doesn't add anything to the price but if you do choose to buy one of these t-shirts i get a very small cut of it so it's a nice way to support the channel if you want to pick one of these up and they do have these in tons of different colors so whatever fits your taste they should have it anyways guys i will see you in video pretty soon thank you for stopping by and thank you for subscribing i really do appreciate every single one we're almost at 13 000 which is really insane for me to think about but anyways

Sven is wearing the 100% Cotton T-Shirt. This t-shirt is the epitome of the classic promotional tee. It has a soft hand to it. It has a unisex cut to it and it comes in 54 colors. So if you're looking for anything from kiwi to kelly green to your classic navy to red, as you see right here, to your athletic gray we've got you covered. And the pre-shrunk cotton is available with different decoration methods. We offer embroidery. We offer 4-color process on lighter colors and we also offer the classic screen print. This is the Gildan Ultra Cotton 100% Cotton T-Shirt available at PinnaclePromotions.com", "3PYxhmnyYfE": "\u200bToday we're talking about the Bella ladies\n100% ring-spun cotton t-shirt. Now, the Bella ladies 100% ring-spun cotton t-shirt is a\ngreat option, great price point, great fit, overall an awesome shirt. I'm going to have\nMaia come over and show it off instead of just talking about it. Right away you're going\nto notice a great fit, tailored side seam means it's naturally going to hug your sides.\nIt's going to offer that more feminine feel to it, 100% ring-spun cotton. It's soft.\n\u200bNow, if we're talking about sizing on this, we do kind of ... Anytime we're talking about\n100% ring-spun, err on the side of ordering one size larger because 100% ring-spun doesn't\nstretch as much as more of a blend does. You'll notice the sleeve length fell a little higher\nthan the unisex version, not baggy at all, naturally complements her body. The other\nthing is the neckline here, a little breathe-ability here. It's not tight up to the neck like some\nt-shirts are. This offers a little breathe-ability here.\n\u200bAll around though, great shirt, a lot of color options and since it's Bella, Bella\nowns Canvas, a unisex t-shirt company so a lot of the colors are interchangeable between\nunisex and ladies. This is great for a ladies group. You can also order the Canvas t-shirt\nfor the larger group of males or just women who maybe want more of a boxy fit, but for\na women's t-shirt, great standard. If we're talking about this versus the American Apparel\nand the Next Level 100% ring-spun cotton, I kind of put this right in the middle. The\nprice point is closer to the Next Level. You save a lot going Bella over American Apparel's\n100%. I believe that you get more out of this shirt too than the American Apparel, which\nis why we probably sell so many of them, although the American Apparel has the name everybody\nreally trusts. Bella is also a name, but anytime you're ordering 100% ring-spun, again, think\nabout ordering one size up in the ladies version because you don't want it to be too small.\n\u200bYou look great in it Maia. Thank you so much. \u200bOn the Co-ed Monkey Soft Scale, we rate this t-shirt a two. Thanks for watching this\nvideo. Please let us know if you have any questions because here at Co-ed Monkey, soft\nmatters and so do our customers.", "YBNjhuVgYFM": "what's up just Ali and as you know I am starting my own t-shirt company line merch whatever you want to call it caught my visual interpretation let's go ahead and get into what type of shirts of that boss so I am going through what's their name TSE apparel so I'm going through a wholesale company called TSE apparel and today I picked up some sample and I can already tell the difference in qual one of them's like a hashey black that's the Gildan and I don't appreciate that I'm gonna have my customers putting a lotion on their shirts I'm about to show y'all in one second we lay about let me lay them out for ya let me lay them out for ya okay so you can see the variations in the and black pusher turn the soft light off that back light you can definitely see the variations you've got Gildan you've got Bella canvas right here Bella canvas and then I also picked up a home brand Toltecs and as of right now just looking down I like these two better already out the gate because you can just tell the quality from looking at the shirts that you know they took their time they took the time this one this one's actually this is definitely going to be or I shouldn't even say a she is just it's just a different black a black that I can't appreciate right now um and what I'm going for with my brand is you know quality products because I can't be giving out no uh no lame stuff but off the camera this one is definitely darker this it goes darker this one and then this one but let me show you how they feel trying all Gildan first so trying on this shirt first I mean it's okay now I have no complaints as of right now it feels it feels fine I feel like maybe it might be a little bit each year but I mean it's not bad whatsoever it's not bad at all it feels good it's not riding up my arms I can it's good like me I mean that's good you thought you got to see some titties psych next is Bella canvas Bella canvas this one feels a little bit better this guilting was a little bit it's not I can't say it's itchy it's just different it's just a little bit different this one you can definitely tell they took their time with it the dyes I mean it just feels good I liked how the hello how come I have my own how the sleeves are it's not it's not tight it's not hugging too tight and by the way all of these are smalls I'm 5 2 and 1/3 ok I'm 5 to 130 so this is what it looks like I mean this is how it looks on me [Music] so this one as of right now between the two that I've already warned this one is definitely tough like I said the color is different the color you can definitely check tell the color colors apart this was deeper this one is like I said this is like an Ashley black this is Gildan Ashley black and right now I have on the belly canvas it's not getting into focus but this is the Toltec okay again this is a small this is a small not too bad I like the fields I like to feel I kind of I when it comes to the actual sleeves I like how Bella canvas and gilt it kind of wraps around and it's tight with this one this one's kind of loose it's not a bad thing it's definitely preference but I don't like I don't I like it to hug me hug me tell me how you really feel so my number one is Bella tall Tex and then the Gildan Gildan is okay I feel like I just feel like the Gildan it's just it's just it's just just this is just I don't know what I got to do to get that feel it like I said you gotta try these things on because it's one thing for somebody to tell you it's another thing for y'all actually feeling it on your skin this feels good like a bread my titties for tuning in this is the start of my visual interpretation support me I love y'all all the realest just a lead", "0hXNSG5qqQQ": "what's up guys it is your boy groupies coming out to you from downtown Los Angeles and today we are going to review a brand new product a heavy weight t-shirt yes that's true he conscious 1000 heavy weight t-shirt go alright guys so I've been on the search for a nice heavy weight t-shirt option for gosh a minute now if you're wondering why your brand they need a heavy weight t-shirt or if you're considering offering one there's a couple good reasons why you might want to think about that there's this certain consumer segments who kind of feel like a lighter weight t-shirt or like a thinner material translates to a lower quality product of course quality means something different to everyone so that's just something to keep in mind but if you have like if you're catering I get outdoors the audience or any audience that really thinks about the overall durability of a product like the longevity how long is this thing gonna last you may want to consider offering or using a heavy weight t-shirt as the go-to t-shirt for your brand so there's a bunch of different scenarios where heavy weight t-shirts come up and it really kinda just comes down to overall consumer preference I've looked at a bunch of these heavy weight t-shirt options and the one that I've been most stoked about is the e conscious 1,000 if you guys haven't heard of the t-shirt manufacturer conscious they really come out everything from a supply chain management standpoint about do things in an environmentally friendly way so this e conscious t-shirt not only is it a heavy weight 100% cotton t-shirt it is also organic so what that means is when they're growing that cotton they're not using pesticides or not using fertilizers so they're just going about things from a very environmentally responsible standpoint so that's also something to keep in mind when you're thinking heavyweight t-shirts of that being a premium offering also having it being a certified organic product adds to that additional brand value that your brand can pass along to customers and make them feel like they're getting a great t-shirt and a great product that's one of the reasons why I like this t-shirt and he conscious as a brand overall just because from a purpose standpoint they're going about all their products along this side eco-conscious way and so that that means a lot to me the next thing I like about it is this is a 5.5 ounce 100% cotton t-shirt and so if you look at like the standard go to premium t-shirt like a bell canvas that's 4.2 ounces so this shirt from a material sample has like over thirty percent heavier than a bell canvas three thousand one t-shirt I've thrown this t-shirt of people and they're like hey man what do you think tell me about it almost everyone's like wow this like a date t-shirt this is like heavy so it suits you kind of like take this thing out of the box and you put it on your ID it feels like substantially significantly different than just a standard run-of-the-mill t-shirt t-shirt is also a side seam so it's on the tubular t-shirt and you know it's cut from two different pieces of fabric and sewn together for the body part which is really great everything's double stitched it also has the neck tape on it right now your boy groobees is rocking a large now I'm kind of guy is like in between a medium and a large and this thing definitely has a box your bag your fit to it so you can see it just it has that really nice kind of overall loose fit and when you're going for a heavyweight t-shirt really don't want these things things to be it's like form-fitting and like attached to your body so this thing's definitely looser and a bag you're fit and I've seen in previous review videos you guys are but how does a watch Huggett percent cut that thing is going to shrink isn't it well I've washed this thing three times already and it's still basically has the exact same fit as before it hasn't gotten shrunked up and super short on you it still has basically the exact same fit so from a wash ability standpoint it's spot-on the reason why they're doing heavier weight t-shirt is really from that durability angle they're really approaching the environmental sustainability thing has hey if we make a better of t-shirt you don't have to buy them as often you won't burn through a t-shirt you know every three months this thing's really set to last six months or nine months or a year so far I've been super psyched about how this thing has held up in the wash obviously three washes is not three months worth of wearing but so far so good and I'll keep you guys posted on that let me quickly try on a medium for you and I'll show you how that fits on your board groobees your boobies is about five nine and a half and I weigh about 150 pounds so pretty average all around whole time okay so right now I'm wearing the Navy this is a medium you can see that this one is definitely smaller on me it's still got a pretty nice baggy fit to it like these or these sleeves are not like super tight form fitted sleeves and they're still just like a nice amount of material around the body that's available now the e conscious 1000 t-shirts they also come in a pretty interesting set of colors all the colors are not like super bright bright vibrant colors that almost remind me of like a pigment dye type of situation where it's like the lighter and the pastel shades so before I was wearing a black one this one is essentially like a navy color they call it Pacific they also have a white and a light gray color they call it a dolphin they have like a brighter kind of red color that they call a pepper they have this amazing yellow that they call beehive it's a super nice bright yellow and they also have like an olive color like a torso really super solid color options for this product all of them kind of have like that a little bit more faded pigment style to them have really really good print quality this is a white t-shirt that is a digital print on it and it came out super super clean really nice we do print with red and green ink so that's why we got a really really nice red but of course they also have the nice tearaway tag on it that's awesome the turbo type is Craig super super easy - real able and they also have like a nice branding message on the back which reads be the change you want to see in the world of course that's from your boy Gandhi boy groobees Ritz this t-shirt a super strong I really like it I think it's a super solid foundation for a brand overall that needs a more premium boxier cut t-shirt it is a unisex sizing but it's definitely one of those shirts that for a female you're either going to be going for just an overall my box your looser cut feel to it you're going to be hitting that boyfriend look you like style it with like jeans and vans that type of thing so it's kind of like the tomboy is kind of luck on the girls side for God's I mean a great go-to t-shirt for skate brands for outdoors anywhere where a thicker t-shirt or you get a certain teen audience that wants that decorative t-shirt so I will leave you guys some links below about where you can check this shirt out I want to hear what you guys think are you guys all Freight heavyweight t-shirts for your brand or you staying away from long is the price point not working let everyone know start the discussion boil down in the comments of box this video is helpful for you guys quickly smash the like button [Music] [Music] [Music]", "lLILkojt_z4": "if you were curious about the Gildan soft style geez 64,000 like this one right here then this video is for you there are a ton of blank t-shirt options out there to choose from so many that stand has this permanent look on his face but not to fear because today we're just gonna look at one in specific the Gildan soft style G 64,000 there are a few important things to consider when trying to choose which t-shirt is right for you comfort style color options and price and also since we are a screen print shop we're actually going to talk about the print ability using discharge and water-based inks which is what we specialize in here at Twin Cities first let's start with comfort this shirt is a hundred percent ring-spun cotton and it weighs 4.5 ounces what this means is that through the ring spun process they've left it with longer stronger strands of yarn what it means for you and I is that this shirt is soft and it's durable shirt was made for wear it's a softer shirt than your Gildan G 5000 your standard heavy cotton t-shirt but not quite as soft as like your next level 3600 your Bella canvas 3000 won American Apparel 2001 those shirts are combed ring spun cotton so they're gonna be a little bit softer but this shirt is a nice middle-of-the-road comfortable shirt next let's talk about styling it's not a Corvette but it's also not your grandma's beige Buick LeSabre out here this shirt is a semi fitted with a tape neck and shoulders it has a rolled forward shoulder so it fits most body types really comfortably it has a nice seamless double collar a durable sleeve and him double needle stitch it is a little longer than your standard t-shirt but not as long as something like the next level 3600 and this shirt comes in sizes extra small through Forex as for shirt colors Gildan always has a lot of color options and this shirt is no different it has a ton of different options to choose from if you look at these charts you'll see that they mix the heather colors and things with it as for price once again nice mill the road shirt as Goldilocks would say it's not too cheap it's not too expensive it's just right and to give you an idea here is a price list this price is 450 shirts with a1 color print and as you can see it fits right in between like the cheaper Gildan 5 thousands and the more expensive fitted shirts like next level labelled the canvas american apparel things like that so this price is really just to give you an idea where this shirt fits among a bunch of our other popular t-shirt options and remember that these prices are subject to change since the time you've seen this video so next let's talk a little bit about actually printing on the Gildan soft style t-shirt since we use discharge inks the dye lot of the shirt actually is very important and what a dialogue is is where they actually take a blank material and they diet to give it its color so in some places like here's an example of a bad dialogue where we print discharge ink on it and we get varying results luckily Gildan has been very consistent with their dialogues we've seen a little bit of problems lately but not too much the important thing is as a customer it's not really that important to you guys because it's up to us to printers to figure out the dialogue problems and it just makes a little extra work for us but for you just so you know the Gildan soft style t-shirt has always been a good option their colors always come out really nice and really consistent one more thing to add the Gildan soft shirt also comes in a ladies version that's the G 64,000 L let me just throw that on for you real quick so you can see what it looks like so once again the Gildan soft style is a very middle-of-the-road shirt it's not fitted so it's not going to make you feel insecure staying here has no shame and it's not a boxy shirt that's gonna make you feel like a square it's right down the middle and now there's only one thing left for you to do and that's to click on the link in the description below fill out the quote form let us know you want the Gildan soft style t-shirt if that is indeed that shirt you want and before you know it you'll have t-shirts of your own we talked about a lot of different terms in this video we talked about ring spun cotton and if you want to learn more about the differences between types of cotton and what those terms mean then click in this video here because I go into detail about those different things and on that note we'll see you in the next video", "XbRr64GkEYQ": "hey guys so i want to do a quick video because i'm going to do some wash tests and uh so i want to do a video of what these shirts look like before the wash test now the three here these three are all sublimation this is sublimation on a black shirt using the 3g opaque paper this is a sublimation on a 99 cotton t-shirt so we might as well consider that 100 cotton t-shirt uh just nothing added to it just straight direct sublimation and the third shirt we have here this one is oh on a jersey dry blend which is a 50 50 shirt so this one we're expecting to get a vintage look this one we're looking for it to come out just about with the print gone and this one we're just looking to see how the opaque transfer holds up if the print washes off or not i'm also going to do a couple of other wash tests since i'm doing that might as well go ahead and throw this in from another video these are the transfers from f m expressions go ahead and throw in these these are screen printed transfers i don't think i put anything on the back of that one this one is um the screen print with the the uh just the foil and we've got a screen print transfer over on this side from them so go in get some close-ups of how they look beforehand it's really really close up some see okay the 50 50 would help if i wasn't in the way of the light there is that one the hundred percent which is more vintage and that would okay let's head to the washer okay guys so here are all three t-shirts side by side the first one here being the uh 99 cotton t-shirt which gave us a very vintage look i'm gonna give you guys my honest opinions on them i'm gonna show you first that one gave us a really really vintage looks looks really really light on the shirt it actually doesn't look bad uh if that was the look i was going for but to be honest with you i've done a lot of 100 cotton t-shirts without any type of poly spray or anything like that and they all really just fade out to the point of where you really can't see the design so i don't know if that one percent poly is saving this or if this is but i know that this is going to fade out some more or at least i feel so so i'll do some more wash tests on it just to see uh what happens but it it'll it may get a little bit lighter than that what happens with polyester with the printing on 100 cotton or 99 cotton is that the inks don't stick to anything because it only sticks to the poly and so since we don't have poly what's happening here is that we're just getting a stain okay and so that stain may stay or it may not it's inconsistent next we have the jersey 5050t and this is pretty much the same result that i get on the gildan 5050 or any other 50 50 blend shirt so that's our look there um and you'll notice you notice this on vintage t it's nice and smooth guys nice and smooth great thing about direct uh with those with with this one i definitely sell this to my customers um and i let them know go back and look at the beginning of the video so that you can see the difference in the color i let them know that you will get a little bit of what a little bit of fading most people are okay with that because they want that softness and vintages in right now so if your customer can get that softness they'll go with something like this most of the time over something like this it's all about a little give and take okay and then we have the last one that we have here is the um jersey tea and this is a black 50 50. again you're actually supposed to do this on 100 cotton and if we had done that we wouldn't see the black coming through of the shirt that's uh what you call dye migration guys so my opinion on this one is that the printing actually stayed pretty good it does look like it faded maybe just a little bit but i'm really surprised to see it stay in because most well i'm not surprised to see it stay in i was surprised when i supplement actually sublimated on it and the ink stayed because i've sublimated on different ones and the ink didn't stay but um to have sublimated on this and for the sublimation ink to stay this turned out pretty good um the only issue that i have with this one is that it does feel patchy and it you can hear it see so versus that so that's the only issue that i have with that one but if your customer really wants a black t-shirt this would be a way to go uh let's also remember that this is a full you know kind of a big patch um all in all they turned out pretty good considering that none of these shirts are a hundred percent polyester and like i said we would i wouldn't do this i'd do that for myself these two right here i'd sell this one is wash tested up to 50 washes but i have a feeling that it's going to end up fading and not fading but cracking i would sell that to a customer who was doing a birthday shirt or something like that and they know it's not you know not for your brand you wouldn't want something like this for your brand you could use something like this for rest in peace shirt something that somebody's going to wear one or two times a few times other than that the one in the middle would be the way to go if you guys want to see how the f and m transfers turned out after washing them then stay tuned", "DhRa8ZGOZI4": "hey everybody and welcome to another crooked craft tutorial before we get started make sure you subscribe to

so excited to show you this I had such a fun time making it I'm going to show you guys how to make this cool bleached shirt and then how you can layer some HTV on top to really make it your own I love the way it came out it's super fun and bleached and you can do kind of any kind of pattern that you want I wanted the nice white square in the center what I love about these is there's really no wrong way to do them even if your square doesn't end up completely square like mine it's still a funnest shirt and there's no perfect shirt and every shirt is gonna be unique and fun and this is something that you can do with the whole family so let's get started I'm gonna show you guys how to bleach your shirt first and then I'll show you guys how to layer your HTV the first super important step is to take some cardboard and put it inside of your shirt all I've done here is taken the flaps of a box cut them off and put some painters tape to hold them together you're gonna want to put this inside of your shirt it's going to help prevent any bleed through of your bleach I highly recommend using cardboard as it is a pretty thick material you can also just buy those t-shirt inserts from the craft store but this is going to prevent any of that bleach from the front of your shirt where the big white square is from bleeding in to the back of your shirt and that way it doesn't look kind of weird on the back with a big white square with nothing in it just get that cardboard all the way in there make sure it is nice and centered sometimes it can be a little bit of a pain as you see I struggled here but once you get that done you are ready to start bleaching on this shirt I am using a 50/50 bleach and water mixture just in a little spray bottle I have it set to the streams spray to fill in that square and I do have this sitting out in the Sun on my driveway if you're gonna do these shirts please be very careful as obviously anything that you get bleach on is going to bleach so be aware of that be very very careful that's why I recommend doing these outside so I let my bleach sit for a minute just to see where I like it and how it's looking and if I wanted to add some more and I just was checking where my cardboard was because I want to make sure that I didn't overspray off that cardboard I do end up with a little spot on the back but it was fine it looked okay no big deal so I just changed it over to mist and now I'm kind of adding some misty bits to the shirt and then what I did is I took the little spray top off and I flicked the nozzle and the bottom hose part all over the shirt to create a really fun like speckled look you'll see me do that here in a minute and then this is just trying to reach out line that Square a little bit more so that it was more rounded off it was a little too small when I did it the first time but you can totally go in and change it up and do it however you want the more bleeds you put on the lighter the color will be but you're also going to get a little bit of thinning on your fabric so be aware of that I like to use a bit of a thicker shirt this is a Hanes 100% cotton shirt so you see I'm flicking the bleach that is one way to do it when I do the back I'm gonna speed that up but when I do the back I actually took the bleach sprayed it on my gloved hand to make sure you do wear gloves when doing this and then I flicked my hand at the shirt to get a different kind of look so you can kind of play with the bleach figure out what works best and what design you like and how you want your shirt to look but I'm gonna go ahead and speed these up so you guys can see it happening I'm letting the front dry a bit before I flip it over to do the back and now on the back I don't want to put that big square so I use some of my mist I use some of the stream and I do some flicking of the bleach on to the shirt I let my shirt sit out in the Sun for a little while and fully dry and then I took it into the house I rinsed it off with some cold water and then I did a quick wash on it once the shirt has been fully washed and dried you can apply your vinyl I am using a mix of Starcraft softflex and Caesar Electric so you're gonna press each layer for just a few seconds now being that the Caesar Electric presses at 305 I just went ahead and pressed the Starcraft at 305 that little bit of temperature difference won't really make a huge issue and all I'm doing is laying each layer down and just pressing it for just a few seconds usually less than five seconds and pulling it up and then removing that transfer sheet you're gonna do each layer like this and then when you do your final layer you will press it for the full 10 to 15 seconds again because I used Caesar Electric I wanted to make sure that I was in fact using the electric settings it was fine with the Starcraft softflex so I had to lay the main bunny down first and then her a really cute red el\u00e9ctrica headband and on top of that I layered some Starcraft softflex white in the stars again just pressing for just a few seconds on each layer that way it doesn't over press go ahead and remove that carrier sheet you do want to remove these ones warm they are warm peel items next comes the little adorable like outline for her headband so you want to make sure that you take your time the reason that you don't do a full press on each layer is because HTV shrinks so if you full press you're gonna end up having a hard time lining them up correctly because they tend to shrink so that's why you do just a really quick press a lot of you ask what he pressed this is this is a Starcraft clamshell 15 by 15 heat press I will link this below it is the best purchase I have ever made for my crafting I use it all the time it's super easy to use and it is a really good quality product so now our last layer is going to be our cute little electric blue glasses that go on our bunny so I just wanted to make sure I got those lined up where I liked them and this time we are going to do the full press because we have all of our layers down and we are ready to go now that we have waited that 10 to 15 seconds here is the finished bunny I'm gonna peel off the last carrier sheet and move it so you can see it here is our finished shirt I love how it came out it was so fun to do and it's so unique the bunny looks awesome she is super cute and the electric really gives it that little extra shine if you guys have any questions please let me know in the comments down below I'm always happy to answer those for you make sure you subscribe to my channel I put up new videos on Wednesdays and Saturdays I hope you guys had a great time and happy crafting [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "p6PMvht5z6k": "\u200bToday we're talking about the American\nApparel 2001 100% Ring Spun Cotton Fine Jersey t-shirt. Now this t-shirt is the t-shirt that\nstarted the entire soft t-shirt revolution. I say that because this was the first shirt\nto be soft. Back in the day, it's hard to believe, but we all grew up with shirts that\nwere stiff. It felt like you were wearing cardboard. This was the first shirt to actually\ncome out and offer a soft fabric, and not only a soft fabric, but a great fit, tailored\nfit. \u200bAs we talk about this here today, just\nthink about that. It dates the shirt a little, and it makes it one of our favorite shirts.\nInstead of just telling you though, we do have one of our models coming over and going\nto talk about this on him. \u200bYou can see, right away you're going to\nnote this side here there is no side seam on the side because it's perfect for this\nwrap logo. This is only one of the only unisex t-shirts, besides our 100% cotton t-shirt,\nbottom of the line, standard economical t-shirts that doesn't have a side seam, so perfect\nif you need a wrap. \u200bThe next thing you're going to notice though\nis though it does have a great fit, it's not boxy, because this shirt, although it is one\nbig wind, it's one fabric, it doesn't have that boxy feel. Love that about this shirt.\n\u200bThe neckline is standard crew neck length here, the sleeves, mid to high bicep, awesome\nplacement here, very flattering, great statement shirt. 100% ring spun fine jersey t-shirt\nmaterial. This shirt breathes great, feels great.\n\u200bIn terms of the price point, it's a little more expensive than the Next Level and Canvas\n100% ring spun, and just that top of the line 100% ring spun material. If you're getting\nthis, you know you're getting the top of the line 100% cotton, made in America as all American\nApparel is. We love this shirt, it comes in a ton of colors, also comes in a comparable\nladies style if you're looking for companion style. If you have a big group of people that\nwant to order ladies and unisex, this is your shirt to go with.\n\u200bAlso, if you're thinking about care instructions, we're talking 100% ring spun cotton here.\nOver the course of its life, we're talking a year, two years down the line, it could\nstart pilling. 100% cotton, we always like giving that disclaimer that if you're going\nto dry this thing on high every wash, it could start shrinking, or just distorting. We don't\nrecommend washing it and drying it on high temperatures. Keep it on low to mid, and it's\ngoing to last a lot longer. \u200bIf you are looking to order for a staff\nat your business or restaurant, or volunteer organization that they're going to wear on\nweek after week, definitely bump it up to the 50/50 or 50/25/25 blend, it's going to\nlast a lot longer. \u200bAs you can see, it fits great, it feels\ngreat, we love this shirt for so many reasons, and I guarantee when you try it on, when you\nexperience this, just like I literally think millions of people have done since the early\n2000's, you'll know why this one t-shirt started the entire soft t-shirt revolution. You're\ngoing to love it, Tyler you look amazing in it, thank you. \u200bOn the Coed Monkey soft scale, we rate this t-shirt a 2. Thanks for watching this\nvideo, please let us know if you have any questions because here at Coed Monkey, soft\nmatters, and so do our customers.", "88t_oHz-g9Q": "what's going on guys and welcome back to the channel in today's video we are going to be taking a look at three different plain white t-shirts from Uniqlo you guys already know how much I love Uniqlo I think they make amazing products amazing clothes prices that are affordable for most people and you guys also know how much I love plain white t-shirts I wear them pretty much every single day and in fact this one that I'm wearing right now is one of the ones that we'll be discussing in this video today the three white t-shirts that I chose for today's video are some of Uniqlo's most basic plain white t-shirts and I chose these because I think that they're the most versatile they don't have any pockets they're pretty basic in their cut and in their silhouette so I think that these are the ones that a lot of you guys will choose if you guys plan on buying some of these plain white t-shirts as well but if you guys want me to review some of uni clothes more Craigie or seasonal white t-shirts I can do those as well because I do own a few of those as well just let me know in the comment box down below and I'll be sure to make that happen also if you guys like this type of video go ahead and hit that thumbs up button because it really does help me out it helps more people find this video it helps the channel grow so I'd really really appreciate it the three shirts that I chose from Uniqlo are the package tri plain tee this is the crewneck version I also chose the FEMA cotton T which is the shirt that Uniqlo is very known for and the last one is the Uniqlo u crew neck shirt and before we get started I just want to mention that I am a little over 5 feet 9 inches as of making this video I'm around 165 pounds so that should give you guys an idea of how these shirts fit me and how they might fit you as well and yeah that's about it let's get started so the first shirt is this Uniqlo package dry crewneck shirt this also comes in a v-neck variation which should be similar if not exactly the same except for the collar and this is the cheapest shirt out of the three that I'm going to show you guys today coming in at around five dollars and ninety cents in the US and here in the Philippines where I'm from it comes in at 290 casos making it the most affordable out of the bunch and this is the one that I was actually the most excited about because I haven't tried the shirt the other two I do own so I've you know I have a lot of experience with it but this is my first time actually trying the shirt so yeah I'm really excited about it so I'm gonna start off with the things that I really really like about the shirt and right off the bat I love the fit of the shirt I like the length it falls around mid crotch for me you know this is where my belt is and I like the length of the sleeves as well they also are not too loose not too tight which I do like it's very it's a very regular fit but it fits really nicely and I'm actually very happily surprised about how the shirt feels so yeah I'm really happy about the fit of the shirt the next thing you'll notice is the sort of the quality or the thickness of the material itself and in comparison to the supima tee that I'm used to this is thinner and you could also say it's a little rougher than the supima tee which may not necessarily be a bad thing because if you're not comparing the two side-by-side you won't really notice the difference because it is still very soft now it is also a little thinner so as you can see it's a little see-through that may or may not be a deal-breaker for you for me it's not particularly you know too much of a negative and in fact in the Philippines ran from sometimes these lighter materials even if they're technically not as good as heavier weight materials can be really nice in the heat you know walking around outside so yeah I really really really really dig the shirt overall I'm very very pleased with this I think it's a very first house shirt you can use it for a lot of things yeah that's pretty much it I really like the shirt and at the price I don't think you wrong with with this with a shirt at all the next t-shirt is the supima cotton tee from Uniqlo this is the famous two pima cotton tee it's very very soft it's very very nice and this in particular is my everyday white t-shirt this one comes in at around nine dollars and ninety cents u.s. and here in the philippines it comes at five hundred and ninety pesos making it sort of the middle range between all these three shirt shirts but yeah I really love the shirt again it's my everyday shirt very very comfortable so let's just get straight into the look in the field first off right off the bat you'll see that the length is very similar to the previous tee to the dry package tee it comes down around mid crotch here the sleeves come around mid bicep and again not too tight not too loose the shoulders are just the right size for me this is a large by the way so all of the shirts that I'm fitting today are large because I'm generally a little bit bigger in the chest and in the shoulders yeah very very nice now in comparison to the previous shirt this is very noticeably a lot softer and a lot thicker in terms of material I did buy a brand new one because I do have a bunch of these but you know there are shirts that have been wearing for a long time now so I wanted to make this video with a brand new shirt just to see how one feels right off the bat and there it is super nice you can see it's not really transparent if it is it's very very little and you know it takes a lot to see that so it is a lot of thicker a lot softer and it feels a lot more durable than the first one but again you know it really depends if what you're looking for if you wear your white tee shirts a lot what you're gonna use them for so if you don't wear your white t-shirt often and you just want to have one in the closet you know you can go either of two ways you can just get this one which is a little bit more expensive but since you don't wear too much and you know you're not going to be spending a lot on my t-shirts you might want to spend a little bit more for this so that when you do wear it it is you know a little nicer a little bit more durable or you can go the other way you wear you know since you don't wear too much you don't really care for that slight bit of extra durability and quality you might just go with the cheaper one they're both great options at this point what I can say is that I'm not sure how the packaged dry shirt wear is over time but for me in particular I have a bunch of these supima shirts some of them are some of them are actually maybe two or more years old and I still wear them until today they fit very well still they basically lasted a long time especially you know this year where I'm wearing white t-shirts almost every day they've they've been very very good so that's it that is number two the supima cotton tee from Uniqlo the third and final shirt of the bunch is this one this is the newest shirt of the bunch in terms of when they came out this is the Uniqlo u crew neck shirt short sleeve tunic shirt and there are many differences between the shirt and the other two shirts but I think that this is one of the shirts that they might keep in their lineup for a long time so I decided to show you guys this shirt as well now this shirt is also a large and in terms of price it comes in at around fourteen dollars and ninety cents in the US but the strange thing is here in the Philippines this comes in at the same price as a subcommittee at around five hundred and ninety pesos so I think we're pretty lucky here in the Philippines for that to be the case and I don't really know why that is but I'm pretty happy about it so again this is the Uniqlo u crew neck shirt short sleeve crew neck shirt and the big difference between this and the other shirts are I think what Uniqlo is going with the shirt is they were trying to do sort of a more retro feeling plain shirt and they do that through having this thicker material so the other two are sort of a soft more modern material I guess you could call it a more modern blend making it very soft making making it comfortable but this one purposely gives you a rough texture a heavy material giving you that sort of more more retro feel the shape is also not as form-fitting as the previous two it's a little bit more boxy as you guys can see the sleeves are a little tiny bit longer tiny bit looser so was the body area and again this is a large but it's supposed to fit that way it dropped a little lower in the crotch and yeah it's a little heavier a little rougher but I do like the shirt because it gives you that you know it gives you that retro look it's a completely different look it looks very very relaxed and as you guys know I love wearing cargo shorts and sure it fits the aesthetic really well so if you guys are more laid-back and you like this casual retro look the shirt might be the one for you now even though this shirt is heavier is thicker it's not like the thickest thing in the world and there is a certain level of lightness to it so they could have made this a lot thicker but they didn't which I actually do really really appreciate especially again here in the Philippines with all the heat yeah here's here's how it looks super nice super comfortable and this is one of the shirts that are in my er rotation I actually only have one of these in my current rotation so I'm happy to have another one after purchasing this one so this is nice some of you guys might actually like the shirt more than the other two and I think that's you know not a bad thing it's a great option there you go so that's it guys that is my comparison of the three plain white tee shirts from Uniqlo the package dry shirt the supima cotton tee as well as this the Uniqlo u crew neck shirt if you guys found this helpful if you guys enjoyed the video let me know by giving me a

so similar you would think they were twins but they're not so let me tell you about the G 200 up next hey guys it's Melissa with shirt space so the G 200 is made up of a hundred percent preshrunk cost this of course makes it soft and less likely to shrink after its first wash the G 200 has what we call a classic fit it does not hug the body too much and is what some call boxy as the G 200 is a 6-ounce it will stand up to any wear and tear that you put it through this is a major difference compared to the G 500 which weighs in at five point three ounces and let's also talk about color the G 200 comes in sixty-two colors so you can definitely find something that will work for your print or a color that you'll like the G 200 is so similar to its close companion the G 500 slice we've set i recommend it as a work shirt a tee to print on and hand out at an event because of its body structure or just as a standard comfortable team as far as decoration for the G 200 it is similar to other 100% cotton tee if your screen printing on the G 200 water-based classes all in discharge are safe but some of the colors range in the hundred percent cotton category so make sure you check its specs before you print heat press on the G 200 is also great but like we always say make sure you check your heat settings before you give it a go oh and you embroidery folks you're also good to go thank you guys so much for stopping by to learn about the G 200 if you have any questions on the shirt or shirt you'd like to see featured let us know in the comments below also make sure you subscribe turn

out the Sun is here to stay [Music] hey YouTube it's Janita from blast oppressed creations thank you so much for joining us I want to start off by saying thank you to those of you who have subscribed to our channel we're up and coming new new business and new YouTube channels so we're trying to be consistent as much as is possible to get content and relevant content I'm relating to the business particularly with sublimation printing tonight I'm going to be doing my take on a process for getting a 100% cotton surface palpable for sublimation and this video is what I watched from a youtuber named Jay Joel's creation that's the name of her Channel and it's Jay a why do s well Jo apostrophe s creations and she's right on YouTube the title of her video is sublimation on cotton using poly acrylic she is what she has so she's going through the process of showing you what she went what she did to create a sublimate able surface using this Minwax polycrylic okay so this is what I'm going to do now I had this in my stash for some scrapbooking and other processes that I wanted to use this for I don't even remember what it was specifically that I bought it for but I know I did not buy this for sublimation because I've had it way longer than I started sublimating but following her process and her technique I'm going to also do my take on it in her video she doesn't walk you through the actual process of creating the mixture but what's inside of this little spray bottle that I purchased at the Dollar Tree is 8 ounces of water and then I use two and 1/2 teaspoon tablespoons of the polycrylic liquid and mixed it in here shook it up really good and what I've used thus far I might have oversaturated the shirts but I saturated the the Front's of the shirts so that it was very damp and then I put the shirts inside of the dryer to dry and there's their 100% dry so what I did I prepared a couple of different shirts so that I could see how this is going to work out to the touch the shirts don't feel any different maybe just a smidge crunchy are on the front then on the back I have one Gildan extra-large that I prepare it and white I have a George brand which is from Walmart large that I prepared in white and then I have two small t-shirts I plan on doing something for my granddaughter so this is the Gildan small I'm white and in the Gildan small gray I have some sublimation prints that we have that we didn't use they were printed out for other things and we never use them so I figured I'd use them tonight and see how they work out with making that surface ready for sublimation okay let me just quickly go through them I apologize because I should have had it ready now these are images that I printed a while ago so I'm going to put this one on one of the small shirts it's already reversed I had some ink leaked on here both sides when I first set up my printer I at this time had these Emerson 7710 and in the very beginning I might have overfilled my ink cartridges so some ink leaked out on the edge of this on both sides over there so I'm just gonna cut around that I'm not going to really focus too much because this is just a test to see how this process will work for me jeido creations has success with it so I'm going to believe that I will as well seeing as I pretty much follow her instructions with the exception she used two teaspoons I used a little bit more in that I use two and a half teaspoons what but what she showed on her channel two teaspoons seems to have worked really good she also posted when she got negative comments down in one of her videos she also stated that she reached out to men whacks and questioned them about the safety of utilizing the liquid on surfaces and they pretty much told her with this small amount that she was using it was not going to be a big deal so my assumption is well actually not my assumption but if I go forward with this particular process there are some other things other than just t-shirts that I have in mind to do with it so if it works out my intention is to utilize cotton excuse me coming over to utilize the cotton as an opportunity to create some other things so with that being said I'm going to go ahead and put this on the white t-shirt this will be just going to my granddaughter so what I'm gonna do I'm having some trouble with my back right now so I can't go back and forth with the camera and like I said I don't have Kim with me right now but I'm gonna take this over to my heat press which is on the other side of the room and I'm going to pre-press it and then I'll be right back over to that area I have my heat press set to 360 I'm going to do the pre-press at that temperature but I'm gonna raise it up to 400 so by the time I get the t-shirt fully ready my heat press will be at 400 okay so that pre-press feels good and I'm gonna tighten up my press raise my temperature to 400 and I'm gonna set my time back down to 60 seconds all right okay so that feels good now I got it tightened up enough wonderful okay so we're gonna put the shirt over here move that out of my way and I've already cut the excess paper off it will have this little bit of extra ink on it but that's okay I'm not going to make a big deal about that I just want to see if this process will actually work I should have used some shirts that I threw away from some mistakes that I mean before but it's all good I'm just gonna eyeball this and go with my gut on location like I said this turtle just be for my grant one of my grandkids and we're around for adventure then broadcasting Jesus will help them behave themselves okay and I'm gonna tape the bottom just because my paper is a little curly down here okay so I got that on I'm gonna get another piece of parchment paper to put it over the top and bring this over to the press I'll press this out for the 60 seconds and then we'll see if this process works fully I'm using a heat press that I purchased off of Amazon it's the company that I need another piece of tape it's a photo ink it's a 16 by 24 and I like it a lot so far I have not had any trouble with it any problems out of it I'm very very very heavy and it's a on portraits style okay so yes j-joe Janos Creations has a couple of videos where she's showing you how she sublimated to a various different types of surfaces so she has a really nice channel she doesn't have a ton of videos but she has some good content there and then later on I'll be bringing a video that I will be attempting some things that I saw from another youtuber where he utilized he used some other materials are I can't think of it right now but I was bringing that content to you as well and we also encourage you if anybody is watching and would like to see us try or work on any particular surface you can leave a comment down below requesting what you'd like to see and we'll definitely give it a try if we have the substrate so if we can get on the material that you're requesting but I do have some videos planned Kim does have some things planned that we'll be doing in the next coming couple of weeks okay all right previous sublimating situations or any indication that this worked I'm gonna say that that's a success because I can see the image through the shirt oh yes look at that oh that works beautifully oh boy yes Jojo that worked and now let me see how it feels oh that worked beautifully oh I'm liking that this is a game changer I reckon yes it is look how nice and concentrated the colors are you can see my little ink mishap down there but like I said that's not a big deal as this will be just a shirt for one of my kids my grandkids I don't have any children this little Kim's my baby and she's 20 oh that looks really good so this works aye-aye-aye aye-aye-aye here this is this is good okay so I'm going to continue and attempt some other things but this looks like it would be suitable I mean it warm its some more investigation as to whether it will be safe the shirts are going to be washed so I'm sure that if you know what this is something that you want it to do to expand your ability to print onto cotton you were in the building look at

polyester T-shirts results in vibrant, photo quality\nresults unlike standard heat transfer paper. While similar to light heat\ntransfer paper by relying on the white or brightness\nof a poly-based substrate, sublimation paper provides no\npop out feeling when transferred. The dyes on sublimation\npaper are the only portion being permanently heat\ntransferred, and they also have excellent washability! To print onto sublimation\npaper, all you\u2019ll need is a sublimation printing system. Before printing however, make\nsure that the image is mirrored, which is typically done by\ndefault through sublimation print manager software. The best way to apply sublimation\npaper is with a heat press. Their large heating elements can\neasily cover standard paper sizes. Setting up your machine for\nsublimation will mainly depend on what type of substrate\nyou\u2019ll be pressing. Our Heat Press Cheat Sheet\nincludes go-to settings for many popular sublimation blanks. When the machine reaches\ntemperature, we\u2019ll first pre-press the T-shirt to clear out any\nwrinkles and moisture. We recommend placing a\npressing pillow in or below your sublimation garments to\nreduce visible press marks. Next, place the paper facing\ndown on the shirt and make sure it stays before covering\nit with parchment paper. And now we can press! Using adhesive spray or\nheat tape can allow sublimation paper to really stick\nto a substrate upon pressing. When the machine is done,\ncarefully remove the parchment paper so as to not slide the paper. The dyes may still be\nactive just after pressing. Allow the transfer to \ncool for a few moments, then peel the paper out,\nand you\u2019re all done!

we're back on part two remember part one we were basically dealing with uh the shirts and how much polyester was in the shirts on the 5050 on the bleaching that was going on what kind of shirts you would use because you see them bleaching and they're they're sublimating sublimating to it and as they sublimate to it [Music] is that a regular 100 cotton but well no they're using basically heather shirts that are a 50 50 blend 50 polyester 50 cotton what i said we were going to do in this episode we were are going to use a 100 percent cotton shirt i'll show you the shirt down here this shirt right here this is a 100 cotton this is the i will show you this is a gilded somebody buy me a camera because this thing is terrible but this is a 100 cotton because i bought it i know what it is and as a 100 cotton what we want to do we want to treat the cotton shirt with the poly t plus and no we're not a sponsor for poly t plus i know they get a plug every time we say it and um and it makes them look good so maybe they are to send me some of that stuff free but um what i'm going to do [Music] is we're going to spray the shirt we're going to saturate it roll it all that stuff that they say to do we're going to do that and prep the shirt so the shirt will be prepared and all ready so what we'll do we will print out our sublimation photo and when we do that we'll put it on the shirt now it's a black shirt so you know it's not going to show up very well at all you know to sublimate on a black shirt is a no-no because you don't have white uh in sublimation ink so you basically have to put a white background to sublimate on so they have a sublimation paper that you can sublimate on it's a process but you can submit it on it cuts it out and you'll have the picture on there with the white uh in in it but it's only the white because of the background so that's what brings it out so you can actually see it on on dark colors but here we've got this black one and we're gonna bleach this afterwards we'll bleach it like everybody else does but we'll do it a little different but we're going to bleach it and we'll see what the sublimation looks like now this is 100 cotton so if somebody says if you got a customer says hey look i want 100 cotton shirt can you do that on 100 cotton and they've got that picture that they want that is a lot of color now unless you've got your screen printing and your screens ready and um you know and you're going to you want to you wanna screen print this you can do it but you'll have to do it after you bleach it i don't know how bleach does on [Music] um on regular plastisols but we're going to use sublimation ink but what we're going to do we're going to treat the shirt first we're going to go ahead and get the resin in the five in the threads the poly polyester resin we're going to get it in the thread so when we put the sublimation photo on there it will look good you won't be able to see it looking good until you bleach it so the bleach is going to bring it out so you'll get to see what it looks like once we sublimate it with the picture and we look at it and say then but right now we're going to treat the shirt so what we want to do um let me get to give me just a minute and let me get to my roller and stuff and i'll be right back okay got my roller here it is this is the roller and what we'll do we'll spray it on the shirt and then we'll use the roller and we'll kind of uh make it you know roll it roll the stuff into the shirt i guess that kind of gets it on the fibers on the on the threads really well and soaks it gets that stuff on there so once we heat press it and i'll have to find the paperwork that tells me how long to heat press it i've got it right there i'm looking at it so i have to walk around the table again and go over there to get that so we'll be right back again okay now do you remember i have my handy dandy ruler and i have the instructions remember dads always read the instructions you know how you get the bicycles and stuff in and you think you can put it all together or remember remember when you ordered the wheel barrel and you tried to put it together and by the time you got done either you were short some screws or you did or you had a bunch of extra ones left over because you didn't put them where they were supposed to be so you found that your wheelbarrow fell apart because you didn't put them all in there like you're supposed to anyways let's um let's look at this these are the instructions to our poly so we're we're gonna we're gonna go through this and look at it and um it says we need to have our press set up to 3 30. uh we need to um [Music] okay so one were well okay we're supposed to mix our poly okay we got all that all that done i still got some in the container here i've already got all this stuff mixed up so i've got some in the container i mixed that up before so i don't know what the shelf life is on that but uh we'll find out um two preheat the press all right three um spray the shirt until damp use a foam roller to press poly t into the fibers okay so we're supposed to spray the shirt and then once we do that once it's into the fibers uh cover lower platen with then cotton material avoid moisture blah blah blah blah blah press light pressure 330 degrees for 30 seconds okay so we need to go for 30 seconds and that says do a second coat of poly t-plus the second coat does not need to be as heavy as the first um and then it says cover with parchment paper press 3 30 20 seconds um heat press temperature 385 degrees [Music] okay the heat press temperature and then 30 degrees to be sure the shirt is completely dry okay well let's do that let's go ahead and get this out of the way now we're applying all right now for you for y'all that don't know what i'm using the bottle is over there it's the polity polly it's the poly t plus um it is not the old poly this is the de-sizer in a separate bottle than the actual quality spray that was when they sold it to start out with and now they just have the polyt plus which has everything in it you just do the spray and you're done so what i'm gonna do here we go all right let's get this started [Music] [Music] we're going to work this in real good and this is getting this into the material that's why i'm using the roller this little piece of stuff is on there but we'll take that off [Music] once i get all this rolled into it real good but remember what we're doing we're putting this poly tea into it because this is going to put the poly resin we need on the material okay now we're going to spin remove this computer out of the way we're going to bring this around slide this back in there [Music] we're going to set this up [Music] then we're going to press it to [Music] let's just press it for 30 seconds and um i guess i should have set the timer for a little bit more because i don't have to set for eight seconds so [Music] 22 3 247 30 seconds now it looks like it needs to press a little longer because it still looks a little damp so i'm going to press it just a little bit longer get the moisture out of the shirt so go for [Music] okay all right that was 15 seconds okay [Music] now according to the instructions it says the second coat of poly tea the second coat does not need to be as heavy as the first and um one thing i didn't do i should have done is i should have used my parchment paper this is parchment paper i should have used parchment paper when i when i did that but i didn't but that's okay it didn't hurt nothing so what we're going to do we're going to go ahead and spray this again all right now we did not spray it as heavy as we did first time but we'll go ahead and roll it out [Music] do set the bottle of poly over [Music] now like i said this time it goes for 20 seconds yeah cover with parchment paper almost did it again so we'll put parchment paper on it i know some of y'all are going to carver's favorite parchment paper thank you for reminding me and here we go we will put this on here we'll go for 20 seconds that timer set at 12 seconds i thought it was 15 but it's [Music] 2 12. 17 18 19 20. all right [Music] and we want to make sure that that is [Music] dry sure that it's dry [Music] now i want to put this i also want our picture to be straight [Music] they put the picture on it y'all could quack quarkitated [Music] that looks like it might be straight and if it ain't well it just ain't all right now what we're going to do we're going to go ahead and print up we're going to print the sublimation photo have i got one yet nope but you know how it is on the magic of camera stop pause video editing stuff whatever i'll be right back okay we are printing the image right this very second i'm cleaning the nozzle head on the printer is the thing clogs up the craziest thing i know if you've got one of these um epson's 2750 wf 2750s that thing ain't done nothing but constantly fog that nozzle gets clogged up so if you're not printing on a regular basis uh that's the only thing i hate about it i'm going to get me a sawgrass eventually i'm gonna get me a sawgrass um one of those printers and um so if y'all feel sorry for me you can send me one if you want to i'll advertise it but um anyways that's the print i got out i'm gonna put gone fishing and um it's funny i can show that i'm looking at it in the in the camera i'm looking at it in the camera and it actually says gone fishing but it's a mirror image so i mirrored the image but actually it's backwards i guess when i show the video too it'll be backwards i'm looking in the background and i'm noticing all my shirts are back let me see yep even my face is backwards i'm standing on the left side of myself don't even realize it all right be right back okay we are back no we had to print up something and uh so we printed up gone fishing that's what i wish i could do to take my boat out there and get out there and catch me some fish speckled trout running old man's back of trout i like spaghetti i like collecting i just like fish i don't like sushi okay i don't eat raw fish i eat real fish hey raw is real and um you say well sushi has real fish now i'm talking about going out fillet them up i mean put them in the pan while they're still flopping so i'm talking about fresh anyways we're going to put this on the shirt now if you'll notice this is going to come out really dark on the shirt you're not going to be able to see it i'm going to be able to tell it very much but here's where the here's where all the trick comes in is when you bleach it then the white is going to show up and then the pit the picture of the fish is going to come out right now it don't look like a whole lot on this paper i don't know what it could look like on the shirt but we'll find out so let's uh let's wait and see you know what this looks like you know what the shirt looks like you know what i look like and uh let's go ahead and put it on the shirt and when we get done doing that what we'll do um because we've already treated the shirt we'll bleach it we're going to bleach it here in the building it's dark outside so i ain't got no sunlight everybody talks about you gotta do it in the sunlight you don't do the sunlight you're not going to walk well i guess we'll do it and we'll do it in the um [Music] we'll do it in our you know so let's uh let's press this thing [Music] okay so we're gonna find it i'm gonna put it on here let's find the spot we want to put it [Music] make sure it's right in the middle okay that should be good i don't know well here's what it looks like [Music] see it i don't see nothing so i don't know i don't see nothing i'm gonna put this over to the side i want to cut off [Music] my heat pressy [Music] and [Music] and [Music] see how that works [Music] [Music] okay we're still waiting on the bleach to do something being that it's inside it's not out in the sunlight it's going to take a lot longer to do so it's uh it's gonna take a little while but that's all right let's see what it looks like [Music] so you can see it's coming along and so the picture starts to get brighter as it gets wider so that's what we're waiting on so it'll take a little bit longer um it's also cold a little cool in here i just kept the heat back on that's what that noise is over there you hear that heater running i'm out here in our little studio shop and uh we'll get this going now i have used this this little roller put some bleach on it and went over the spot where this picture is at so it will kind of whiten it a little more but um i don't get these tapes over here but it's it's just cold in here and i don't think we're going to get any better than this and i don't want to keep the bleach on there too long bleach is not good for the material get these off there and if you don't like the little [Music] don't like the little piece of tape on there as far as the little stripes [Music] don't like them you can always blend them in a little bit [Music] put you some little marks across there [Music] blend them in with the shirt [Music] now we'll take this shirt we're going to put it over here and we just dropped it in our bucket of water that's a actually a bin with [Music] oh we got it in the water and [Music] now that we've done that we got it in the water um i guess it's best to do it during the daytime unfortunately i didn't have time this afternoon to be in the sunlight i was too busy out doing other stuff so maybe i going fishing you don't know that anyways i've got uh got him in the water and uh we tried that out um the pitcher did not come out as well as i wanted to i need to pull the printer head off my printer and clean it so we're going to try this again but anyways i think it looks pretty good it looks kind of um well they call it a distressed a distressed shirt a gone fishing distress shirt but it would be good to have that little clear because uh there's something about the black shirts of turn orange uh i guess and the thing that is the bleach that i'm using is old bleach and it looks like it's been separated because of the cold weather so so at least i didn't get all over me so we will do this again tomorrow when the sun's out and hopefully it's not raining but uh we're going to do another black shirt and we're going to i'm going to pull the print head off there tomorrow before we do the video and this will be part three so this is part two we did part one this is part two tomorrow we'll do part three and i won't load i'm gonna load this up tonight i'm gonna edit it and load it up tonight and let you see what we got and uh and then we're gonna do this again and uh let me let you see the shirt one more time i just squeezed the water out of it [Music] anyways [Music] so that's what you got on that i've got a lot of a lot of other ideas so it'll look like it's kind of straight right here like the piece of styrofoam got a piece of styrofoam under there you gotta be careful it doesn't take the shape of your [Music] so [Music] [Music] so and what's good about this i've got all this is basically neutralized and i just went over here and just did this corners kind of make it spread out but now i'm going to unneutralize it because i'm putting more bleach on again oh how about that [Music] till next time part three tomorrow lord bless [Music] you", "NKSd7Cqsfk0": "Today we're talking about the Next Level\n60/40 CVC t-shirt. Now this is one of our favorite t-shirts by Next Level because it's a great price point and for just a little more than a hundred percent\nring-spun cotton offers a ton more softness. That 60/40 blend of polyester/cotton means it's gonna be so much softer than just a hundred percent ring-spun cotton t-shirt.\nStill offers a great fit, awesome colors. Instead of just telling you though, we do have our model here, he's gonna come over and show it off. First thing you'll notice is just a\ngreat fit. It has this tailored side seam like all Next Level t-shirts have. So that means it's gonna naturally cut in and it's not going to be that boxy shirt we all grew up in. Next the neckline, the neckline is great 60/40 means it does have more stretch than a ring-spun cotton. It's just awesome because it's not gonna be tight on your neck. The sleeve length is also great it hits mid-bicep here, perfect dip right there. We love this shirt for so\nmany reasons. One of the other things about it is the colors, it comes in so many\ncool colors and as you can see it's a little heathered here. Meaning made of kind of speckles of different shades. That's signature to a blend because a blend is made of different fabric types, Cotton and Poly. So, with this we naturally recommend a vintage ink a thinner coat of ink, so that if we do a vintage white this blue color can come through just a little and make it look a little older, because the heather already looks a little aged, so that just plays off of it. We can always do a standard ink, do a bright white ink, but it's a little thicker.And this shirt is just so soft, so thin, it just moves with your body. Great length on the Next Level shirt too. Care instruction wise, you're not gonna have to worry about shrinking it. That polyester means that over the course of a lot of washes, it's not gonna pill. If you're ordering for volunteers or an event that needs to go on week after week after week or maybe\nit's your staff shirt this is a great step up. Go with this any day over a hundred\npercent ring-spun because it's gonna wear so much better over year or two. You're gonna love\nthis shirt! Tyler, you look awesome in it too! Tyler: \"Thank you.\" Thank you. On the Coed Monkey Soft Scale we rate this t-shirt a three. Thanks for watching this video. Please let us know if you have any questions because here at Coed Monkey, Soft Matters and so do our customers.", "I0dYWtua97Y": "Welcome back to the gentleman's Gazette! Today's video is all about cotton. We discuss what it is, what it's not, the\ndifferences in qualities, the impact on the environment, what you should look for when\nyou buy it, and what to watch out for. Cotton, you might wonder, isn't all cotton\nthe same? No, it isn't. Even if it's a hundred percent cotton, there\nare huge differences and today, about 75 percent of men's wear garments have some form of cotton\nin them. It's very affordable, versatile, and accessible,\nand it can hold up to 27 times its own weight in water. It is grown on two and a half percent of the\nworld's arable land and overall, it's a fiber you should know about. So what exactly is cotton? It's basically linked from the cotton plant\nwhich is part of the Gossypium family and the fibers were meant to protect the seeds\nand are comprised entirely out of cellulose material you often find in nature, such as\ntrees. Outer fabrics such as viscose, or bamboo fabrics,\nare all based on cellulose as well. Cotton plants are actually shrubs and they\ngrow wildly but today, they're cultivated most of the time. Looking back, cotton was found in garments\nup until 6000 BC and it was mostly found in the Middle East. Today, the commercially for most grown cottons\nare all derived from that ancient cotton plant. Columbus noticed that when he came to the\nBahamas, it had a huge impact on slavery which was perpetuated by the growth of cotton itself\nand to learn more about it, I urge you to check out our in-depth guide on the website\nhere. Today, most of the cotton comes through US,\nChina, India, as well as many countries in Africa, and South America. In the US, commercial level growth of cotton\nis heavily subsidized while developed nations hugely rely on machines to harvest cotton,\nit is still picked by hand in Africa, or in Egypt, in India, and developing countries. Ofcourse, picking by hand is much more labor-intensive\nand the people who do it or not paid very well. At the same time, you get a pure fiber simply\nbecause you don't get any impurifications into the fiber at the picking stage. When cotton is harvested, they usually select\nthe seeds and so after harvesting in the country of origin, as well as the country where the\ncotton is spun and woven, it goes to many gins that make sure to remove all the seeds,\ndirts, and impurification from the cotton. Because the purer the cotton, the better it\nis. Not all cotton fibers are alike, the better\nones are longer and you can get them in five or six centimeter lengths which is like two\nto two and a half inches. Lower and cotton has shorter staples and it's\nharder to spin them into yarns at the same time, it is usually softer but you will see\npilling much more quickly and it will wear out prematurely. For that reason, all quality cotton products\nrely on long staple cotton. Once the fiber is cleaned, it is spun into\na yarn and sometimes you have a 2 ply yarn which means two strands of yarn apply together\nwhich helps to create a more resilient yarn that is at the same time, more consistent\nand long-lasting. Another process to improve cotton is called\ngassing. It's used to brighten the fiber, smoothen\nit which gives it that typical quality Sheen you may know from higher end cotton shirts,\nespecially in the twill weave. Once the cotton is woven, there's a number\nof different finishing steps that are sometimes proprietary to the manufacturers and it will\nhelp to really get the best out of the cotton fabric. Now that you how it's made, let's talk about\nthe environmental impact. Cotton is very resource-intensive in the growing\nstage, as well as in the manufacturing stage, and it uses a lot of water and the chemicals\nused to process it can be ecologically very damaging. As a crop, cotton likes warm\nclimates and as such, it is oftentimes grown in areas where there's not enough rainfall\nso it heavily relies on irrigation such as in Egypt. To keep pests at bay, you need a lot of chemicals\nbecause of that, genetically modified seeds have been developed that keep pests at bay\nso you don't have to use as many chemicals, but you still need a lot comparatively. Because of rising levels in cotton that gets\nto the end producer, the whole movement of organic cotton was started which is ever-growing. By definition, organic cotton neither has\nchemicals or pesticides and it doesn't rely on genetically modified seeds. Apart from cotton using a lot of water, it\nhas to be linked to desertification in parts of the world as well as solidation of the\nground. The absence of cotton art is an organic material\nthat will decompose unlike things like nylon or polyester. In terms of cotton quality, it all starts\nwith a staple length. Short staple is considered three quarters\nof an inch or about one and a half centimetres. Medium staple cotton is considerably about\nthree quarters of an inch to one and a quarter inch; and a long staple cotton is anything\nfrom one and a quarter inch all the way up to two and a half inches. While the majority of cotton in the world\nis a short staple and then some medium staple, you will only see the staple infused in marketing\nfor higher end cottons. Sometimes when you see labels of higher-end\ncotton, you will see the term sea island cotton but what exactly doesn't mean? It is an extra-long staple cotton grown on\nthe sea islands outside the South Carolina and Georgia. In theory, the sunshine and the level of humidity\nprovide the perfect conditions for a high-quality cotton. Even higher form of cotton is a so-called\nWest Indian Sea Island cotton which is legally only allowed to be grown\nin parts of the Caribbean. Even though the output is limited by the size\nof the island, there are a lot more products labeled as sea island cotton western Sea Island\ncotton that is actually made in any given year. Obviously, there's a lot of fraud going on\nin that part, however, if we can get your hands on genuine West Indian Sea Island cotton,\nit's almost like touching cashmere. Sometimes, shirt makers also advertise Egyptian\ncotton and basically what they mean is it's the longest staple cotton from a batch, it's\nnot necessarily cotton that is always from Egypt. You'll also\nfind Egyptian cotton in towels or anything that touches the skin. Usually, it's used to demand a higher price\nfrom the consumer. A subgroup of Egyptian cotton you see so-called\nGiza cotton which is more high-end. Each giza quality comes with a number. With giza 45 con being the most luxurious\nand high-end Egyptian cotton on the market, its extra-long, has superior fineness, and\nis very consistent. To guarantee the highest quality of the longest\nstaple giza 45 cotton, it is hand picked and hand combed so there are no impurifications\nand you get the finest cotton there is. Sometimes you see pima cotton or american\npima which is named after an American Indian tribe, it is also considered to be a extra\nlong staple con and it came about in the 1900s. You may also have seen supima cotton which\nis short for superior pima cotton and while it's not a grade, it's an organization that\ntries to promote pima cotton. Like organic cotton in itself is not a description\nof quality, all it tells you that no chemicals or pesticides were used and it's not genetically\nmodified. It doesn't tell you anything about the staple\nlength, so if you pay more for organic cotton, you do so because of the impact it has and\nthe pesticide freeness, not in the quality. In my experience, West Indian sea cotton is\nreally the cream of the crop and I would even place it above a giza 45 cotton. For dress shirts, Ialways go for a two ply\ncotton and make sure that it's a hundred percent cotton and it's not stretch with polyester\nor nylon. While it makes it more durable and it's may\nbe appropriate for uniforms, work wear, maybe for chefs in the kitchen, it's not something\nyou want to wear on your skin because it's rougher and not as comfortable, also it's\nnot as absorbent. If you're lucky, you can also sometimes find\npolo shirts made at a pima cotton, however, most of the time, it's a lower grade cotton. Interestingly, thread counts or gsm grams\nper square meter are units used usually for linens and towels, not for garments. In my experience, there's a lot of fraud going\non and I wouldn't rely just on a number that's presented to me. So how can you find out if the cotton is luxurious? The problem is that you have a soft cotton,\nit can feel very comfortable on your skin, but it's in fact soft because the staple is\nso short. Higher-end cotton is usually very fine which\nmeans you can have a very fine weave and you get a very nice Sheen. For men's shirts, probably Albini is a largest\nkid on the block and if you want to learn more about that company check out our guide\non the website here. At the same time there are other good cotton\nmanufacturers out there but sometimes the problem with relying on brands is that they\nmay change the quality over time without you noticing it or without them changing your\nlabel. For example, I own Polo Ralph Lauren sweaters\nfor over ten years and the quality has gone downhill by a lot. The sweaters have gotten softer but it's because\nthey used shorter staple cotton that pills much more easily and looks old and the colors\nlook washed out much more quickly than the older sweaters I have. So what are their cotton buying do's and don'ts? Don't believe that all cotton is created equal. Quality cotton is usually softer, it is shinier,\nit is finer, and it has a smaller impact on the environment because you can wear it for\nlonger periods of time. You should always expect more from a higher\nand cotton retailer; they should be able to tell you what specific kind of cotton is used,\nhow many plys they are, how heavy the fabric is, and where it was sourced. At the same time, don't believe all the labels\nthat are not backed up by a trusted industry Authority such as Albini, Thomas Mason, or\nTessitura Monti, or other famous cotton makers which are known to produce a quality product\nmade out of long staple cotton. So how shouldyou care for cotton? Fortunately, it's one of the more easier items\nto take care of. You can machine wash it, you can hand wash\nit, but machine wash is totally fine, the only time I'd stay away from machine washing\nmy cotton is in a suit such as a seersucker suit or another cotton suit but mainly because\nof the canvas and the things on the inside not necessarily because of the fabric itself. Ideally, you should always follow the care\ninstructions on the label because if you wash it too hot, the color may come out and I also\nwould urge you to wash it with light colors, otherwise, the chances of it looking duller\nis much higher. To keep colors vibrant and cotton in a good\nstage, it's best not to wash the pair of jeans after every single time of wear and if you\ndo, you can pull them inside out just like with the sweaters to try to prevent pilling\non the outside which is visible. Also, it helps your cotton if you don't over\ndry it so ideally, air dry it. If you have to use a dryer, maybe partially\nput it in a dryer and then hang it to be air dried, otherwise, if you fully put in a dryer\nyour garment won't last as long. When it comes to dress shirts, should never\nput them into the dryer because of the interlining that may come lose, it's harder on it so always\nair dry those. You can either iron a dress shirt when it's\nwet so it's relatively easy and the wrinkles come out. The problem is it takes a lot longer and so\nyou have to figure out what makes sense for you. Ideally you put it on a hanger and let it\ndry. When in doubt about the temperature you should\nwash your cotton on, go with a lower temperature or wash it on cold because it will make sure\nthat your colors last longer.

In today's video I'm wearing a rather casual\noutfit made of a polo shirt from Uniqlo out of 100% cotton. the collar is made like a shirt collar and\nit's not so flimsy like usual polo shirt collars because of that I really like it because. I'm wearing it untucked it's not longer in\nthe back than it is in the front and the shorts I'm wearing are by Polo Ralph Lauren made\nout of a soft cotton this is an old pair of shorts that is still made out of a higher\nquality cotton in my opinion than the newer shorts you can buy these days my shoes are\ncasual summer shoes called Alpergatas from Spain they are made out of a checked cotton\nfabric on a u2 soul with rubber it's a very summery shoe and it doesn't give you a lot\nof structure yet it's breathable and I find it perfect for outings at the beach or just\nvery summery resort wear outfits that don't really care about formality.", "boX_isNul7M": "Today we're talking about the District\nThreads 100% ring-spun cotton t-shirt. Now, over the past few years this has\nbecome one of the most popular and most demanded T-shirts we've seen, for a few reasons. One is the price point, two is the color options, and three is just the fit and fabric. It feels great, fits great and again, that price point is amazing. So, so many bands look at this shirt as their standard at merch tables. Instead of just telling you\nabout it though, we do have our model coming over and we're gonna show it off.\nNow, first thing you're gonna notice is it is a great fit but there's no side seam here, which that's, that kind of\nbegs the question, what does that mean? Well, without a side seam we can\nactually do more of a wrap logo, which is very popular. If we had a side seam\ngoing down the side, it could be an uneven print right there, which makes the ink\nkind of bunch up and not be as good. So this is perfect if you want to have a wrap logo. The next thing we're gonna talk about though is just this neckline. It's bound on the\ninside, super clean neckline here. 100 percent cotton has a good stretch to it without being too\nstretchy. The sleeve length is pretty generous here. It's a little longer than, maybe the comparable Next Level or American Apparel, but still hits at a great point here, not baggy at all. It comes in great colors, and like I said before a great price point for this shirt. 100 percent ring-spun cotton, now you might be wondering, does that mean it's gonna shrink? How should I wash it? What size should I order? It fits very true to size, on top of that, it is a hundred percent ring-spun, so you're not gonna have to really worry about shrinking it. A year or two years down the line if this becomes\nyour favorite t-shirt, I'd just say, don't nuke it in the laundry. You know, kinda keep it to that mid to low heat, because cotton, over the course of its life, could shrink. Cotton also can pill, so, if you're looking for\nlongevity of a shirt, I'd recommend maybe looking at the District Threads 60/40 blend or\nmaybe a Canvas, Next Level, American, one of their 50/50's if it has to wear and re-wear every week for volunteers or maybe, if you're ordering for employees that have to wear it. But this is a great price point, 100% ring-spun cotton, same line of thought as the Next Level or Canvas in terms of pricing. Cheaper than American Apparel though and the Alternative Apparel. So, if you're looking for a great price point go with this, which is why we get it demanded so much. Thanks so much, you look awesome in it! On the Coed Monkey Soft Scale we rate this t-shirt a two.

space here to explain what CVC is in short CBC's stands for chief value cotton and long it is cotton and polyester wear cotton makes up 50% or more of the fabric in the shirt this was a way for the manufacturers to reduce both our import and export costs but in doing so they realized that they've made a great alternative to a tribal NT as CVC teas are breathable soft durable and lower in cost by creating a great tea CBC's have begun to dominate the market while a triflin is a great option definitely keep CVC teas on your radar thank you guys so much for stopping by today to learn more about CVC if you'd like to see more helpful videos like this click that subscribe button and have a great rest of your day here's an interesting fact for you according to the internet cotton is actually stronger when it gets wet here's another interesting fact for you shirt space comm is your best option for all your blank apparel needs just sayin", "gs5tMYU9j8k": "[Music] hey what's up everyone my name is garrett and today i'm going to go ahead and just review and give my thoughts really quick on the different t-shirts that uniqlo offers for their men's line these are gonna be just their either basic t-shirts or some of their undershirt t-shirts all with a crew neck so uh yeah let's go ahead and just jump right into it so i'm going to go ahead and go through three of the t-shirts that uniqlo offers i guess you could kind of say it's like a low price mid price high point price all these t-shirts i wouldn't say are like super expensive it's anywhere to like a very affordable brand something like competing with like a walmart five dollar t-shirt and then you have something all the way up to about fifteen dollars [Music] the first shirt on the list is the uniqlo packaged t-shirt uh this is the only shirt on our list with a polyester and cotton blend so 66 cotton and 34 polyester uh the shirt fits a little bit tighter than all the other shirts and the materials also much lighter makes me kind of get the impression this is an undershirt i'm a little bit on the thinner side but this shirt fits my arms chest and my waist pretty snug some notes if you're a little bit taller than six feet or a little bit larger you might want to go up a size as you can see the shirt material is pretty thin so you'd want to probably wear an undershirt if you're just wearing this on its own the thing to note is the shirt is kind of a lint magnet so probably just keep that in mind if you're getting the black color way this next shirt is the supima cotton crew neck it's 100 cotton and retails at 14.90 as you could say this is the shirt that got uniqlo on the map for the t-shirt game and this is personally my favorite of the three t-shirts to wear kind of just all around at the time of this video i got the shirt for 9.90 on sale and i'm very very happy with the fit overall t-shirt similar to the package t-shirt is slightly fitted around the arms chest and the waist things i like better with this shirt over the packaged t-shirt is a slightly thicker neckliner and a little bit more material on the body of the t-shirt to help retain its shape as you can see it's a little bit fitted still around the arms chest and the waist but i feel too tight like a muscle t-shirt that has a little bit maybe of like a spandex blend to it this right here is just the white version of the supima cotton t-shirt my opinion i would just skip over the package t-shirt and just get this one the great thing about the supima cotton tee and i guess what i look for in just any t-shirt is its ability to retain its shape and specifically the neckliner once i put it through a few washes and so the last t-shirt on the list is the u-crew this is a 100 cotton and retails for 14.90 the two main differences when compared to the two previous t-shirts is that the fit of this shirt is significantly larger than the previous two it's kind of more of a boxy slightly oversized fit and then the material is also much more dense and heavy honestly here the neckliner for this shirt is significantly thicker than the previous two shirts and though this is 100 cotton as well uh they seem to use a significantly larger amount of cotton in this shirt than the previous supima cotton shirt you can see here there's a lot more room in the sleeves and it's just roomier at the chest and at the waist overall if you compare this to the supima cotton crew you can kind of see how that material is a little bit lighter and softer and the u-crew is a very thick and heavy material it's either if you want something lighter go with the supima if you want something denser and it has sleeves that has these sleeves that are longer maybe going right above your elbow then go ahead and grab yourself this uniqlo u-shirt so if you

"V9mXnHViDUY": "welcome back to maddie bugs creations channel and i'm megan and i'm grateful to everybody that watched my first video on how to make the poly tea a spray and i am back with another episode on how to actually use this poly tea spray that we made in the very first video that i made if you've missed it you can go back and watch it still have just a little bit left i'm going to show you guys how to put this on first after before not after but before we do that i'm going to show you this shirt that i made for my son and i went ahead and i washed it three times in the washer to show you how well this poly tea spray that i make holds up there as you can see there's no fading or anything on this shirt it looks just how it looks just like how i had um printed it or he pressed it or whatever you want to say so this poly tea spray i believe is like the magic to sublimating on cotton besides having to go out and buy um all polyester and a lot of people like the cotton fill better than they do the polyester fill all right so i'm going to show you guys how to put this on this shirt if i don't break my tripod because all right so here's the shirt which is a little kids shirt that i'm gonna do tripod keeps breaking okay so the trick is not to put too much on this shirt because if you put too much on this shirt it will turn yellow all right so what you want to do is you want to lay the shirt flat and you want to spray just a little bit over where you're going to put it you want to spray until it is completely wet you don't want to over saturate it so if you over saturate it it will turn yellow on you so like three or four sprays with this mister now if you have something that's not a mister you might have to do it like seven times but as long as the whole part is wet the image will stay on there now i have already went ahead and did another shirt that i've already sprayed down that i have underneath my heat press over here that i'm going to show you what it looks like after it is heat pressed on let's see my cute little design it says no more chicken nuggets or chicken nuggies i'm just going to lay that down there on my shirt that already has the poly tea spray on it because it has to dry you have to let it fully dry before you put your sublimation on it because if you do not then it will smear and it will it just look really bad the image will look real bad so i'm gonna go ahead and heat press this and show you what image looks like after it and when i put my heat press on is 350 and i put it down for 40 seconds on this particular shirt well actually i do it on all my shirts and i believe that that is the best setting for my heat press because everything seems to come out more vibrant and better if i put it on too much then i usually end up having yellowing of my shirt and the shirt just doesn't it's hard to get that yellowing out even if you use peroxide for me it is so let's see all right lift it up move that and we move our image and voila no more cheeky nuggets yeah let's get some stuff on it anyway move this back just a little bit all right i think you just got included all right so this is what the shirt looks like after it's been pressed still as vibrant as the one that i showed you after it had already been washed three times and this shirt was already brown like that i was practicing with my bleaching um so if you all if you all like videos like this or if you need any more visual effects on t-shirts because i love doing t-shirts um please like and subscribe my video and leave a comment down below and i for for ideas that she would like to see done or anything that you all would like to see done and i will do it and i'll show you how it's done thank you for watching and please like and subscribe my video or if you don't like the video then put the thumbs down helps either way thank you bye", "ixY1Af77Bjs": "[Music] okay guys so today i'm bringing you how to do sublimation on cotton this is very easy as you can see i'm printing my design this is the design we're gonna do today don't forget to mirror it as you can see this is the paper that i'm using for sublimation it's pretty good so the ink is gonna be a little wet because we're gonna put some polyamide polyamide is a powder that we're gonna put on top of our design uh don't forget to follow us on etsy uh so as you can see i'm gonna start like putting all the polyamide on top uh on top of the design it has to cover the whole design but like i said it's gotta be the designs had to be a little a little wet so you know sometimes you had to like print it less slowly so you had to cover uh the whole design so in that way you know it's gonna be working perfectly so the polyamide what it does it it's like a like a sort of glue this the way it has to look you can you can see like over here it's everything cover the letters the blue color the red and once you have it [Music] covered with the polyamide powder what we're gonna do we're gonna cook it so i have a heat gun that i used to use for soldering so now i'm using it to cook my design so you're gonna start like like putting some heat on on top you gotta move it because otherwise you're gonna burn the the sheet so you have to melt a little bit the powder with the ink as you can see it's turning a little different instead of getting a little brighter over here let me do this right here okay so you have to do this for your design otherwise it's not gonna work uh so like i said the polyamide is what it's doing it's acting as a glue uh some people were telling me that the polyamide for some people could be people could be allergic to polyamide i don't think that would be a problem you know uh and i have used this for like so many times even for my kids and none of them they have a problem with it so just try to cover the whole design like i said i don't think polymer it's something that is going to burn you you know like cause you some irritation and over here we have the design and in my case i always like to do it double so in that way it's gonna look perfect i i mean how much polyamide you're gonna use just like a little bit you can reuse it you can reuse this polymer like so many times um i have a bag that is i have been using like so many times okay so you just like shake it a little bit so in that way there's not gonna be like an extra polyamide on on the design over here i can show you that it's like the first time when we put the polymer on top so once again once you powder the the polyamide on on the design we're gonna cook it again i always try to like you know put it flat so because with the heat the design is going to curve a little bit so again we had to shake it and you know like cook it a little bit i found another way to if you don't have a heat gone you can press it for like five seconds but you have to put um you have to put like a um a sheet on top of the design like facing up and i just like press it for like five seconds but it's gonna be like the paper is gonna be like a special paper like some sort of uh like um i don't know how you could how you call it i'll find out and i'll put a comment on the on the bottom like to show you like what type of paper you have to use okay so over here you have your design you have to cook it like i said got to make sure that all the design is covered and the letters too you know because we wanted to make it look pretty nice we're gonna make it look professional and once you're done what we're gonna do we're gonna just cut around so because you can see the the square we are gonna use that okay so all right so we have it ready to press on our garment this is a shirt for my kit and this is the design as you can see i cut around so to get rid of the square now you have to place it wherever you wanna press it and you know like you're gonna press like like some other uh sublimation design that you do in my case i do it for 400 degrees uh i used 35 seconds and because 400 degrees is a lot you know and then after that just you have to let it cool off you have to let it cool off for a few or a couple minutes once it's cooled off we're gonna use some water cold water once it's cooled off we're gonna start like pressing a little bit on the design on the paper especially make sure that it's cold it's not hot and we're gonna start like putting some water like this okay we're gonna get the paper wet because in that way it's gonna be like more easy for us to remove it you're not gonna you know like peel the the paper and the letters are gonna come off so that's why it's very important that you uh take your time get it wet get it done right so put a little bit wider it doesn't matter if you get like some water on the shirt i mean it's gonna dry so don't worry about that so put a little water like on every single corner um this paper has a little as you can see look kind of blue so one time i was just like scrubbing it and the blue it was like coming off touch it make sure that it's feeling wet you know it's not hard this one is still hard so we're gonna put more water and like i said the blue i don't know as part of the paper it was like getting on the on the shirt so that's why i tried to be careful you just like put a little pressure um once it's all wet try to peel from one corner and if you feel like it's not coming off try to put a little bit more water don't rush the design because otherwise you're going to ruin and we don't want to do that so just like take your time put a little bit more water just like go easy with the design once it's all wet it's gonna be like so easy to peel it off and you're gonna see the paper there's not um ink on the paper all the ink is gonna be transferred to the to the shirt okay so it feels much better it's coming off uh little by little don't try to rush it okay coming up perfectly in this corner right here okay um okay okay this right here and don't try to rush it like i said just go easy one corner and another okay the letters you gotta be careful and there you go as you can see i got a little water on the shirt but that's nothing to worry about take a look at the design it looks good and the all the ink was transferred i'll show you that this is a 100 cotton let me show you right here i'll make sure that okay here we go 100 cotton oh let me get the light okay there you go 100 cotton sublimation with polyamide i mean it looks good pretty good it feels good it's not gonna wash away like some people were saying that if you do sublimation on cotton it's gonna wash away the only thing you have to find you can find the polyamide on etsy or ebay take a look at the design it looks pretty good pretty legit letters are perfect design is perfect and like i said i mean the poi i made you can find it on etsy or you can find it on ebay either way and it comes from powder all right guys thank you for watching hope you like this video subscribe if you have any comments

blends poly t plus is a one step formula that allows you to prep and sub a shirt in only five minutes paula t plus does two things at once it removes the chemical sizing and it also lays down a polyester resin on the cotton threads let's talk briefly about chemical sizing thread is coated in chemical sizing during the manufacturing process to prevent the thread from breaking while they weave the fabric together sizing can cause two problems one is it will burn and scorch when heated and it will also cause your image to fade after the first second wash poly t plus is sold as a concentrate there are three reasons why we sell it as a concentrate number one we sell it as a concentrate to prevent freezing when we ship it to colder regions we also sell it as a concentrate to extend the shelf life of the product and lastly we sell it as a concentrate to save you money because we don't want you to have to pay for us to ship water across the country since i'm pretty sure you have water where you live here are the four smaller sizes that we sell of poly t plus the four ounce bottle poly t plus will make 16 ounces of spray when you add water and it will coat about 30 shirts the 8 ounce bottle of poly t plus concentrate will make 32 ounces of spray and we'll coat about 60 shirts 16 ounce bottle we'll make a half a gallon or 64 ounces of spray and we'll coat about 120 shirts and lastly the 32 ounce bottle of poly t plus will make a gallon of spray and coat about 240 t-shirts all right so before we spray the shirt we do want to get our heat press heated up because this formula needs to be pressed while wet so i need to make sure my heat press is ready so as soon as i'm done spraying i can press it wet in order to remove the sizing and cure the poly t-plus at the same time so i've set the heat press at 330 degrees and that is currently warming up so while that's warming up we're going to go ahead and spray the shirt the first thing i want to do is i already made up my spray i took the four ounces of concentrate poured it into this 16 ounce bottle and then i added 12 ounces of purified water and shake it up and you're ready to go okay so you want to spray the poly t plus about the size of your image this cardboard is just slightly larger than my image so i'm going to use this as a template to mark to have an idea of where to spray and then you're just going to spray you get it good and wet you need to have it wet in order to see steam and to remove the sizing so this step is actually going to be wetter than the second coat that we will apply after all right i think that's looking pretty good next thing you need to do is cover it with parchment paper any other type of paper will stick so it must be parchment paper uh this is parchment paper from costco the thicker it is the better because if it's really thin and flimsy it will tend to get wrinkles which will press into your shirt so we lay that across there and you should see some steam coming out here okay that's 30 seconds open it up that first coat is dry now we're going to apply a second coat this is the second and final coat this one can be a little bit lighter than the first coat and i'm just i kind of remember where my image is going so i'll just spray that area right and roll it in again all right oh and by the way this shirt is actually a 60 cotton 40 polyester and we recommend starting with a minimum of 40 polyester because you're gonna get more vibrant images uh the shirt that i'm wearing is actually 100 cotton um i did this whole technique on this shirt and it's already been washed but in my opinion it's not as vibrant if there's at least a little bit of polyester in there all right now this time this is the second time we're pressing it wet this time we're only going to press it for 20 seconds and this is to cure and dry the poly t plus so we're ready to subtle mate okay all right now the shirt is ready to sublimate so we're going to set it aside before we sublimate we need to pre-press at 385 for five seconds to make sure there's no more moisture left in the shirt okay i'm ready to subtle mate i got this really cute design from debbie does design and i'm going to put this on the shirt center there and what i like to do is i like to cover my sublimation paper in this case it's just multi-purpose paper cover that with regular copy paper so this absorbs any extra ink that might pass through that way when i do my butcher paper i can keep using this butcher paper over and over again and not have to worry not throw it away and not be so wasteful okay so we have the temperature of 385 we're going to press medium pressure for 70 seconds and actually i just did want to show you here we don't i don't have anything on the press except for the thick rubber mat that came with my heat press and that is because all the seams are off this press if you were doing a smaller shirt like a onesie or kid shirt or even a raglan shirt you would need to lift up the image area higher using a silicone mat so you would lift cut it about the size of your image put it underneath the shirt so that your image area is higher than the thick seams on your shirt like i said medium firm pressure 70 seconds all right 70 seconds is up all right looks good nice and vibrant still feels really soft if you happen to get too much coating on there and it feels a little stiff the softness will come back after the first wash thanks for joining me today be sure to subscribe to our youtube channel also join us on facebook look for the group titled dye sublimation

it was about time to start getting some basic tees in place for the warmer weather you probably all know by now that uniqlo is my go-to when it comes to affordable basics what you get for the price is unbeatable in my opinion so for this week's video i decided to pick up the most popular and most talked about t-shirts i'm gonna try them on and talk about what i like about each one and what i don't like about each one i'm six foot and about 73 kilograms and i picked all of the t-shirts up in a size medium which is my true size i'll let you know which one's my favorite and which ones i don't like so much at the end of the video i've also measured each of the t-shirts just to give you more accurate information on how they differ in size but anyway without wasting any more time let's get straight into the first t-shirt so the first t-shirt that i've got is the crewneck supima cotton tee in white the first thing that i noticed is the color seems to be a bit more of an off-white than a pure white which i happen to like but it may not be what you want when ordering a white tee the quality feels lovely and the tea is so soft just what you'd expect from cp mccotton this tea comes in at 27.5 inches long a width of 20 inches from pit to pit and a sleeve length of 9 inches so let's have a look at how the tee fits the first thing that i noticed is the neck opening is a lot wider than i was expecting apparently they've updated this tee to have a slightly more relaxed fit so that's probably why i usually like a tight-fitting neck with my tees but i actually don't mind the wider neck here and i think it will look decent underneath an open shirt or a jacket this tee in the white is also slightly see-through not enough to the point where i wouldn't wear it but it may be for you if you don't like this then maybe opt for a darker color in this tee all in all it feels beautiful the quality is there but for me the fit is a little off i think i could have probably sized up with this tee for a more relaxed look but i'd still wear it as it is the next t-shirt we've got is the airism oversized u-range tee in black this is a very soft feeling tee and actually a bit thicker than i was expecting the quality feels really nice and i already know this is going to be comfortable this tee is made from 53 cotton 30 polyester and 17 elasto multiester this t-shirt comes in at 12 pound 90 and i think that's a very decent price for this tee this team measures 28 inches long a width of 22 inches and a sleeve length of 10.5 inches the tee is so soft and it has a decent weight to it this one may be even more comfortable than the supima cotton t2 the quality feels great and this tee fits me really well for an oversized tee the sleeve length and the body length ratio is perfect for me sometimes tees can have massive sleeves and then too much of a crop in the body which some people do prefer but for me this is the perfect balance for an oversized tee the neckline is really soft just like the rest of the tee and it fits snug to my neck this tea also has a drop shoulder for an even more relaxed look and i really like this feature on this tee all in all i'm really impressed with this t-shirt and for the price you may not find anything better for an oversized tee however we do have another oversized tee coming up next so maybe that'll beat this one next up we have another oversized tee from the u range that i picked up in this petrol blue color it features a pocket on the front and a split at the hem which are nice additional details this one is made from 100 cotton but it feels a lot stiffer than the other teas on the list i don't actually mind a stiff tee when it's in a heavy weight material and i actually prefer that so it's not a problem for me this tea also comes in at 12p90 which is an absolute bargain for a tea like this due to the split hem there's different lengths at the back of the front of this t-shirt the t mesh is 27 inches long at the front and 27.5 inches at the back it's got a width of 23 inches and a sleeve length of 10 inches so now moving on to the fit the tee has a generous boxy fit oversized sleeves and a slightly shorter length in the body i'm aware this tea is designed to be a bit shorter at the front in the body but for me i'd like an extra inch of length so maybe sizing up a size would work better for me it's nowhere near as comfortable as the airism tea but that's not really surprising the neck is softer than the rest of the t-shirt though so that's a nice touch and you don't have to worry about it rubbing i'm in love with the colour and the details of this tea but for me the tea doesn't sit as well on me as the airism tea does the final tea we've got here is the ut this is a classic tea and one of the first styles i ever picked up from uniqlo the ut is made from 100 cotton and it has a bit of a heavyweight feel to it like the previous t it's got a bit of a rough feel to it too and although that doesn't bother me it's definitely worth mentioning this one also comes in at 12 pound 90 which seems about average for a u-range t from uniqlo the team meshes in at 28 inches long a width of 22 inches and a sleeve length of nine inches like most of the u-range products this tee has a slightly relaxed fit which i really like i feel this tee fits me perfectly and sits well on my body i've had a few of these tees in the past and i feel the material is slightly thinner on this newer model for some of you in the warmer countries this may be a good thing but i always prefer a thicker tee the neckline is ribbed and it has a nice tight fit to my neck which i really like the thicker neck also means you don't have to worry about the neckline getting misshapen in the wash the length and the sleeve length is spot on for me although the sleeves are a little floppy all in all this tee fits me really well and i'm really happy with the way it looks so for me each t-shirt serves a different purpose if i wanted to wear any of these t-shirts as an undershirt then the one that wins it for me would be the supima cotton t-shirt for an oversized tee i would go for the airism tee the fit on this t-shirt is lovely and it's so comfortable too i love the color and the details on the oversized pocket t-shirt but the fit on me is just not quite right and i do prefer the airism oversized tee over this t-shirt and last but not least the best all-rounder in my opinion is the uniqlo ut the fit is spot on with this tee and although it's not perfect there are a couple of things that i would change i don't think you can beat this t-shirt for the price and it's probably the one that i'll be wearing the most in the spring and the summer months but whichever t-shirt that you go for you can't really go wrong they're all great for the price so choose the one that suits you best but i hope this video has helped you out and help you decide which one you want to get maybe just pick up all of them if you can't decide like i did and let me know your favorite down in the comments but anyway as always thanks so much for watching please do give the video a like if you enjoyed it hit subscribe if you're new and i will see you next week see ya", "Ytg16bt2460": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys kelly walters here with stahls tv and today we are doing video two of our bleaching series and today our focus is going to be with sublimation transfers now as you can see i do have a roll of cad cut here and we will be using it and specifically we are going to be using our cad-cut glitter flake in our hologram gold but incorporating into the transfers this round it's going to be two versions of sublimation so our first is our cad prince sublimation transfer and then our next is our patterns specifically using a sublimation pattern so what we are doing is i am showing you how to play with bleach now i mean that very loosely of course we're going to be bleaching some t-shirts i'll be using our gildan softs or using gildan's soft style tees i'm staying in the heathered colors now i will tell you we will be using the sun outside so when we go outside to bleach bear with me on the outdoor elements and of course hopefully the sun will stay strong and we'll be able to knock it out of the park now the first thing that we need to do is go ahead and cut our art for our glitter flake we don't have anything else to do with sublimation so that is done and ready to go next we will weed and then we will take our t-shirts to the heat press we will apply our sublimation transfer and then we will apply our cad-cut glitter flake transfer and then we will go outside and bleach now before we get started before you get started make sure you do testing of your own with bleach it can be very tricky there's elements that can have an effect on it if you struggle use some heat i know that helps and then of course make sure you wash test whatever you are um trying that way before you sell it to the customer you know it's successful and it can be washed so let's get started hey guys before you get to bleaching there's a couple of things to keep in mind there are a variety of squirt bottles out there i just am using an empty glass cleaner bottle it does have a little bit more of a mist versus a stream so if you are wanting a certain style of bleaching i do encourage you to try a couple of different bottles a little bleach can go a long way and that's something that i've learned throughout this project so make sure you try just a little before you add way too much and then you can't take it back all right so the first thing we're going to do is go ahead and protect our lower platen now i have just folded a cover sheet about three quarters that way if i wanted to use the other side i could cut it off use it for smaller things and because we are using a size small i'm not too concerned you know with the logo getting outside of where our protection is um just because of the size of the logo that we're using so now that we've threaded our shirt we're going to just lightly pull it off we want to try to have as many seams as possible off of our platen and then next up we're going to pre-press for six seconds this allows any moisture wrinkles to go ahead and release from the shirt okay now that that is finished we're going to go ahead and lay our transfer right back down where we wanted it now because i'm going to be adding bleach to this i'm not too concerned about the logo being about two fingers down right now we are about a hand so four fingers down again when i spray the bleach it's going to kind of come up here so instead of the logo shifting upward it's going to be now in the middle more of in the middle of the chest okay we are applying for 395 for 60 seconds now the other thing to consider is because we are on an automatic release press i am actually going to hold on to the press before it lifts up that way i can control it okay now we have about 10 seconds left so i'm going to go ahead and just hold on to the press i'm pushing it down that way when it pops i can control it coming up now of course it's a hot peel all right now next up we're going to go ahead and load our green shirt now same thing we will need to pre-press now i am using a new cover sheet for this shirt but i'm going to go ahead and use that same cover sheet underneath the shirt for the transfer so pre-press now like i said i folded it and as you can see we have a little bit of ghosting here now i'm just going to fold it that way i can use this side and i'm getting multiple uses out of this cover sheet versus just one and done and throwing it away now for ease i'm just sticking it underneath the neck and i really want to make sure this one is in the center now for this transfer our goal is to create a pattern underneath our vinyl so what i recommend doing so you don't have the straight edges is i've just gone and i have torn it's not going to be perfect but when you are bleaching a shirt it's never going to be perfect now if you want you can go back in and of course make it a little bit straighter you can add a little bit more character to it you have really good control over the size that you would like to use and that is exactly what i am going to go with i can feel where my my cover sheet is so i'm just going to adjust this just a little bit now this one is definitely more a center of a center chest and because there's no way to get a good square center on this i'm just eyeballing from my perspective okay again we have 60 seconds and i will stop it once if we are at about 10 seconds and again hot peel okay now that our sublimation is done we are going to go ahead and apply our glitter flake because the glitter flake will not be affected by the bleach it's okay to go ahead and apply that and then spray the bleach on top so i'm just going to go ahead and find my center very quick and i'm just going to place it in the midst of the middle on top of our sublimation we're not quite even in our square but hopefully this will just give us a good idea on what it would look like i am pretty much in the middle if i'm aligning up with the tag i just see that i have a little bit more sublimation on this side versus that side now this is a hot peel just my pressure and especially with the sublimation make sure you use a cover sheet since we're not back at the 395 we didn't activate the sublimation we just have a little bit of ghosting right here so just always take precaution and protect your upper heating element all right let's go bleach this all right you guys we are outside and the best place to bleach is actually in the sun the sun activates the bleach just a little bit quicker and you get to see results faster versus waiting overnight you can do this inside it's just much easier to kind of see where the bleach is um bleaching when you are outside so these are just two um cover sheets that i have used in the past i've just folded them in half um as you can see i am using an adult small in this gildan so i don't really want the full 16 by 20 size i'm just gonna put it in there for protection because it's not going to be the exact size that i need it there might be a little bit of bleaching spilled over but that's okay also ignore my boots i'm just trying to make sure i don't get bleach everywhere okay so i have my my bleach in my windex bottle and then i am just going to lightly spray you don't want to go too much too quick because there's no way of taking the bleach back so as you can see we are starting to get a little bit of change so in the middle of the logo that's where i'm really trying to spray the bleach you can see that we are starting to turn colors it doesn't have to be perfect and of course you don't want that soak through on the other side but if you do it's only going to add some characteristic to the shirt but you can see the characteristics of the shirt starting to come to life i am going to just set it to the side and then up next we have the full sublimation okay i went ahead and threaded our cover sheet like i did previously on that now the same effect that i had with the other one i am just going to spray [Music] all over right around where the logo is okay we're gonna let that one sit for just a bit and then we are going to review what they look like once they are finished hey guys we are done and i cannot wait to show you and review both of these shirts now if you remember i said to use a little bleach because it goes a long way the reason why i said that is because i used a little too much bleach bleach specifically on the go cats logo and i will explain to you why here in just a minute but make sure you just test a little and if it's not turning like i should just be patient be a little more patient than me and you will see some results i promise so the first we're gonna first one we're gonna review is our peace love and rock and roll as you guys know i did have um some cover sheet um inside of this we did have just a little bit sneak through on the back but that's okay i like character so i think it just adds a little bit more to the shirt itself just because you know it's already got a lot of character there's not a lot of rhyme and rhythm in this now the reason i always say just be a little patient is because as you can see down here i got a little bit higher up i was kind of going more for that type of effect but i did creep up to the side and then this actually turned out um pretty decent in size comparison to the logo if you remember we dropped the logo down when we were applying and it's because that bleach just creeps a little bit further up to the neckline i added a little bit of character here on the sleeves and overall i cannot wait to wash this it has not been washed yet literally put the blow dryer on it to help speed it up and now it's a little crunchy it just needs to be drawn uh washed and dried that way we can rid um any of the bleach remaining on it so anyway i think this one turned out great i'm really happy with the overall kind of grunge look that it brings now this one i definitely went really crazy on the bleach as you you guys saw it was just taking a little bit longer to turn well they were both taking too long to turn but the whole point with this was to have the leopard effect so i went about two inches too far past where i really want it to go so the idea was that we would have this bleaching this you know kind of crazy pattern like right along the edge of the leopard so you do see the rip transfer i kind of like it i'm not against it but what we were going for was more of the fade away with the pattern and then the go cats on top of that as you can see we also are now picking up the pink in the leopard which originally was not there when we were spraying outside so once the shirt went white or cream we definitely pick up more color from our sublimation transfers now as far as the rest of the bleaching goes i love the splattered look across the bottom i just wish i wouldn't have gotten too crazy with the bleach and um you know didn't go too far down but a little goes a long way it is um a knit you know it's it's a material that soaks up water or liquids so just keep that in mind when it comes to bleach that it is going to spread just a little bit but overall this concludes the end of our two-part series with bleaching if you haven't seen video one we use just heat transfer vinyl and i hope you enjoyed learning how to sublimate and then bleach on the guild and soft style t-shirt i'm kelly walters thanks so much for watching this video i really hope you have enjoyed this content if you haven't give us a thumbs up otherwise we will see you next time and get creative bye guys you", "1fpD4WUiy14": "[Music] so I'm really excited because I got a stand for my iPad so so I won't have put it right at the edge of my table it's a little shaky when the table moves but it's it's like amazing but so what I did was I printed off this image and on my sublimation printer right there and I don't have a heat press I just use a pretty easy press for now till I make enough sales to make or to buy a heat press but this works perfectly for me so I don't have any problems with it and I'm gonna press this and show you guys the steps I do - sorry I didn't I don't want to have to keep like fixing the stand to go up and down so I'm just gonna come down here but I'm gonna show you the steps I do to get the results of a bleached t-shirt and our link where I got my shirts where I get my images from I buy my images I buy a drive and there's this lady on Facebook she has a drive I think when I got it it was $28 now it's up to $60 because she has more images but it's a lifetime drive and she constantly adds images on it so it's super nice but I got this online somewhere so to not get when people press these down there sometime as a square for your image so to not get that ok this so what I start off by doing is pressing my shirt and I set my Cricut the highest temperature it goes up to is 360 so I put it on 360 and then for the time where I put 60 seconds and in between the shirts here I have a piece of cardboard just a little piece of that little but enough to cover this shirt where you're going to put your image at so I don't go to the back and I just position my my image where I think it will look best and then my Cricut press is ready to go so you can put a piece of printer paper on top to protect your Cricut press or your heat press or whatever butcher paper whatever you want to do okay lately I've been having problems with my pretty easy pressed it's been the temperatures been going crazy and then the other day I sub his shirt I he did a supple I did a sublimation image with this shirt and it was a kid shirt so I didn't have a piece of cardboard small enough and I used a cutting board which was the dumbest thing of me and I think the the water from the cutting board just went in my Cricut like absorbed it because after that I would press a shirt and like there would be like water on it but it would go away so that's why I don't understand what happened but yeah my Cricut press it's going crazy so I do suggest you guys to get a nice heating a nice heat press I'm just gonna let it cool down because it's going up to 400 degrees and it's not even supposed to go to 400 degrees okay okay so this is what my easy press looks like and you're just going to put it on an image and press Start and you're just going to hold down a little bit you don't want to put a lot of pressure do not mind my hair I gotta press it again cuz I only set it for 30 seconds you want to do it for 60 seconds but I'm saying do not make my hair I just started a new job and I've been busy but I will get to that on another video and update you guys on everything and yet before you saw this you want to make sure you're sure is and I'm going to do them here for just 30 seconds just to make sure because this isn't that big it's only I think 9 by 9 and then I think the next one's like 12 by 12 so I'm just going to do it for 30 seconds just to make sure see that last part did not go so what I'm going to do is go like this because I don't want it to get scorched I'm gonna do 30 second three here because this was I think ten but this was a ten by ten image see on cricket you can print it you can't do a print to cut image I think bigger than nine buy something or it's like six point nine five by nine so I upload my images on the word and that's how I print ten seconds just to make sure okay and that is the image that we printed it's a little salt girl that says don't be salty the bottom could have been put then then press it down more but I don't want it to like mess up but this should be good because once you bleach it everything lightens up and it looks like a completely different shirt next time you see me we will be outside okay you guys before we have outside I just wanted to show you what I use I just use and I filled it with bleach you don't even need this much bleach but and I just use this bleach it's like $1 something at Walmart it's just a great value bleach yeah so this will work perfectly and I know some people dilute the bleach they do like 50% I think water 50% bleach but I just do 100% bleach so this is what you'll need and you'll need some trash bags I use trash bags and I put it underneath the shirt and I'm going to do that and then okay you guys so I was going to go outside and show you guys how to bleach this shirt but I walked outside and my neighbors are building a fence so I don't want to go out there and take my iPad out there on the stand and them to look at me like I'm a crazy person so cuz I'm still getting used to all of this like earlier my fiancee came home and I'm like standing in the kitchen like talking to myself and I'm like okay can you stop but I'm going to show you guys how to I'll do it inside I don't recommend doing it inside because the fumes but I'm gonna do it inside and then I'm gonna get outside to let it bleach fully so what you do is and don't do not drench it in Bleach that was my mistake my first bleach t-shirt I just was spring and spring like crazy because I thought I all had to look like saturated you know but what you're gonna do is just spray around your image and do a couple sprays in the middle and that is all you need so I'm gonna start off doing that and that is just gonna spread to the middle so you know about that and you can see it already turning a different color so when I take this outside which I'm not gonna do this part in here it's already smells yeah it's ready I'm really strong so I get a paintbrush like this you can get any brush I am using a one and a half inch brush I don't think the size matters but you're gonna dip it which I put bleach in like a little container and you're gonna dip the bleach or dip the brush in the bleach and you're just gonna fling it like that and certain motions and really like all I did in my lap my first two shirts I just did like one two three and that was all I needed and it came out so pretty so right here I'm just showing the flicking motion that I do with the brush with the bowl of bleach and after I do this I let it set for like 10 to 15 minutes and then I throw it in the washer with a little bit of detergent and then I dry it and after that your shirt will be done [Music]", "LLCb4hjFWPs": "you guys I'm going to be extra truthful today my biggest pet peeve is when my t-shirt shrinks after washing it it really can turn my day upside down but why does this happen let's get into it [Music] hey guys it's Melissa a shirt space so the shrinkage in the tee can be caused by a couple of things first it could be the way you wash it but the second can be if a shirt is preshrunk or not so let's get into that what does preshrunk actually mean the term preshrunk mostly speaks for itself but there are a few factors to be aware of so I took notes to make sure I get this right preshrunk doesn't necessarily mean that the t-shirt manufacturer washes every single garment instead it refers to the garment being put through a machine that pushes or compacts the fibers tightly together this process condenses the fabric by removing the spaces in between the stitches as a way of replicating the shrinking process in doing this the garment has been pre shrunk and will shrink less when being put through the traditional washing and drying process now let's be real I couldn't have memorized all of that point number two having a pre shrunk shirt doesn't always mean the shirt won't shrink further most fabric will shrink on average three to seven percent so you won't typically notice but there will always be some additional minimal shrinkage to be where bottom line is preshrunk implies that the shirt will no longer string but what is actually the case is it will just reduce the amount of shrinkage thank you guys so much for stopping by to learn more about preshrunk if you want more industry knowledge or helpful tips click that subscribe button turn on

creation on facebook if you want to and instagram and all that stuff if you want to um follow me on all my t-shirts and stuff like that i will link everything down below um i've had a lot of requests on facebook about how i make my poly tea spray and how it actually works because a lot of people say that you have to have 65 cot or polyester or more and that you cannot sublimate on 100 cotton well i'm going to prove him wrong today that she can actually sublimate on 100 cotton and the shirt i have on is actually 50 polyester 50 cotton and my poly t spray was on this shirt and it made the image pop out more than what it really would on a 50 polyester 65 is also very great to have because your colors you don't need to use the poly t spray and your colors come out more vibrant and this is without poly t spray on a 65 cotton or polyester and the colors came out perfectly cool on those that's what the colors look like on 65 polyester now i have already used my spray on one of my shirts that is 100 cotton and i've already pressed it and i'll show you what that looks like before i make the spray and that came out looking like this so the colors are still just as vibrant as a 65 cotton or polyester i'm sorry 65 polyester all right so i'm going to take you over here to my table and i'm going to show you how i make my spray okay in this spray you are going to need sorry i gotta get this situated right in this spray you're going to need not this a spray bottle that is eight eight fluid ounces or you can do 16 fluid ounces just like my dawn spray bottle is here which i like using these because it's got that power mister and you don't have to spray as much and work as hard and then you're going to need this poly acrylic i've got the poly acrylic clear matte i got this at walmart for 18 i got the big jar and it should make quite a bit another thing you're going to need is a tablespoon because you're gonna need for every eight fluid ounces you need two tablespoons so for this particular bottle i put four tablespoons of this poly acrylic in it and then i fill it up with water and it works perfectly fine it made that shirt that i just showed you all so i'm going to go ahead and let's pour this out i don't have very much in there i'm going to go ahead and make it for you guys so what i do first is i open up my polycrylic and i dip my spoon in here make sure that it is level with a teaspoon and then i put it in here try not to make a mess like i do i'm one of the messiest people in the world yep just put four in here one that's two just make sure your teaspoons or your tablespoons i mean tablespoons are level when putting them in your jug or your bottle and you can use any spray bottle you can go buy one for a dollar at the dollar store or you can get your if you use this kind of a dish liquid you could just wait till it's empty and use it or you can use it you can just use any kind of spray bottle laying around i think that's four one more perfect all right and then after i get my tablespoons in there i will just fill it up with water i use cold water for this you want to use cold water for this and shake it up and that is how you make polyt spray it will be white looking should be white looking when you're done and that is my magic poly tea spray", "g5QQLQG4lQI": "hi folks Martin here again we're to give you an update on this transfer paper we used in my last video of the dieter cotton sub lis power the emember net powder and the special transfer paper we've watched it a few times so let's have a little look to see how it's turned out right okay well here's the garment here and it's probably been through to watch four to five times so it's been worn quite a bit now and I'll just show you closely so that you can actually see the the finish on it and it degraded at all I'll show you I've got a new camera by the way so I should be adding some really close images of this so let's have a look at it now well though whether you can actually see that the the color seems to be okay it seems to have held up there and the feel of it as you can probably see is nice and soft and if I stretch it as you can see look we're stretching it there and as you can see it doesn't actually crack or split when you stretch it so I personally think that it's actually it's down a pretty good job so yeah let me try get near the actual ink looks like it's gone into the actual fibers itself look at that look that's pretty close detailed at any now I want to try and let me out because I'm very zoomed in oh not bare with me let's zoom back out there there we go and that's what we were actually looking at so that in my eyes is pretty impressive but I want you to take it one step further now don't forget we use sublimation ink with this so what I'm going to try now just thought about this and I'm going to give it a go I don't know if it's going to work or not because I believe that it might be the polymer powder which is holding the image into a takes it off if it takes the sublimation off of this special paper they give you the sublimation paper and it allows it to bind into there now when we use transfer papers the transfer paper is basically very similar I supposed to this polymer powder and I use dye based inks as you know so what I'm going to actually do is I'm going to print an image out on this transfer paper in dye based ink and then I'm going to put the powder over the top and see if we can transfer a dye based ink image as opposed to a sublimation ink image which is a lot dear a sublimation ink so we'll see how that goes so I'm just going to print an image out now and then we'll put the powder on so bear with me for a second right okay din well I've had to use some standard sublimation paper because this thicker stuff didn't want to go through my printer for some reason so I'm just going to put this now in there this is still a little bit wet there we go and I'm just going to get this sublimation powder just pour it over the top there like that and then just sprinkle it down the ink all over the ink as you can probably see and don't forget this is just standard ink this isn't sublimation ink in here so I don't know whether this is going to work or not couldn't tell you doesn't like it's really stuck to me to be honest with you okay din so we'll just lift out the standard paper which I don't think is going to work but we'll give it a go anyway and just place that facedown there put a little cover sheet on it I don't think this is going to work and give a 30-second blast we're on a kite night not transferred at all here we go so you must use sublimation ink with this as you can see standard ink doesn't work whatsoever so that is definitely an owner that is sublimation paper but that is normal dye based inks so you need to have the sublimation ink with this product to be able to do a peel away on a standard t-shirt so what I'll do I'll quickly just transfer this image now onto the sublimation printer and we'll actually do this image on a standard sublimation paper this time and see what it does with that no I don't think it's stuck to that paper either this is standard transfer paper and it's not actually stuck to that so we're now going to have to try the standard sub b2 cotton transfer paper and give that a go so again we'll put in our reco printer face down like that and print it again alright well I've actually run out of ink I've got a changing table motioning but you can see they're mostly this half of the picture is still looking look mottled and wet so let's put this in there sit this on there that okay here we go I get the image here alright so this is the image now to go onto our t-shirt right okay so place it face down all right here we go and we'll remove the transfer paper don't forget this is out of cotton t-shirt nice and then you go there's another one freshly printed there as you can probably see let's let down on the workshop so yeah there you go there's another one we print it out on the back of this so it appears that you have to have the right paper this with standard sublimation paper now this transfer officers right although I've printed out on this transfer paper which is sublimation paper this will actually transfer onto a polyester garment they're all mouse mat or anything even though it's dry to the touch because this is transfer paper and it's sublimation ink so there you go that appears to be holding up pretty well after about five washes and again we just printed a new one there we've tried it with a few different variations we try doing it with diabase things for that special powder that didn't work and then we went over to the sublimation ink and obviously that worked as well so it needs to be done on the paper that comes with this kit which is the sub litre cotton paper and this time why did I actually raise the temperature to 190 degrees C for 30 seconds that one I did 180 degrees C and it really hasn't really made any difference to be honest with you so hundred and ninety is probably a better one to go because you're going to get more penetration with the the material into the actual garment so anyway I hope that was of some used here that was me follow-up of our subleader cotton product which we tried in our last video ok then thanks very much hope you enjoyed this video and we'll see you again in the next video bye for now you", "IvxaCYaYnD4": "hi everyone this is rene romeo of rene romeo calm today you're going to learn eight different ways to repair a hole in a t-shirt so my t-shirt has three holes in it because the kiddies have been climbing on me and if you have an old t-shirt that's been relegated to the back of the closet well go ahead and grab it and use one of these eight methods to repair your t-shirt so you could start wearing it all over again so I'm starting with an old t-shirt here and I have a very sharp pair of scissors so I'm just going to go ahead and poke eight holes into this t-shirt now what this is going to do it's going to allow me to put each one side-by-side and then I'll go ahead and I'll actually launder this when it's done just to see how well that repair held up now I'm using a 100% cotton t-shirt today and six of the repairs that I'm going to make are going to involve some type of polyester or polyamide along with some type of adhesive to make that repair but if you want to keep this 100 percent cotton then you're going to grab 100 percent cotton thread and you're going to make those repairs with a needle and thread now I've taken the t-shirt I've turned it inside out so I'm now working on the backside of the t-shirt I've taken a piece of craft paper and I've slid it underneath the hole and this is going to actually make the hole a little bit more visible for me to work on and it'll protect the ironing board cover from any adhesive that I might get on it so I have three different versions of 100% polyester fusible interfacing my versions come in a lightweight medium weight and heavy weight and that also means that there's a lightweight version with lightweight adhesive medium weight adhesive and heavy weight adhesive so we're going to see which one works best on our 100% cotton t-shirt so here's hole number one now I'm taking a toothpick and I'm just going to kind of coax this together a little bit before I get going here and try to get this hole to look as small as possible once I do that I could take my iron set on the wool setting and with steam at this point so we're going to try to get this hole to come together as much as possible and iron it nice and flat flat I have a square piece of interfacing cut out this one happens to be the lightweight version so the one side that has the adhesive on it I'm going to stick this straight down on top of the backside of that fabric and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a press cloth now my press cloth happens to be flannel it's just a white piece of flannel and it's dampened with water and wrung out I'm gonna take this damp cloth place it over the top of this and try not to move that little piece that I cut out then the iron comes straight down wool setting with steam and it's going to sit there for 10 seconds and I'm going to look at this and see how well this stuck to the fabric now that seems really good now I'm going to press it from the right side and see how well I did in comparison you can kind of see that it's still there so let's see if we could do one better on the next one and this time I'm going to take a little more time with the toothpick making sure that this fabric gets close together before I iron it this time I'm going to go back in and I'm going to make sure that these little pieces of thread are almost touching before I press it one more time now this is my medium weight interfacing I have the adhesive on this side and I decided to trim this in a circle this time just to see if there was a difference so it gets placed straight down on that fabric I have my press cloth again that's nice and damp that gets placed right on top of it and then the iron goes straight down for 10 seconds looking pretty good I'll flip it over and iron it from the front side now this one looks a little better than the first one so let's see if we can get even better with the third [Music] so the next two t-shirt repairs I'll make are with a fabric called poly amide and this poly amide is really a wonderful aquella and the reason why is because it's adhesive on both sides so the first thing you're going to do is you're going to make a patch out of some type of fabric so mine happens to be flannel I don't have a corresponding knit fabric that'll match this so I'm going to use flannel for this then I'm going to take the poly amide and I'm going to put it directly over the top of this patch and I'm going to cut it exactly the same size now here's the patch so I have the flannel underneath and I have the poly imide on top and I'm going to place this directly on top of that hole just like that then I'll take the pressed cloth and I'm just going to lay this down again this is damp and the wool setting is chosen on my iron for ten seconds now hopefully you can see here that this isn't the greatest way to make this patch because it doesn't exactly adhere to all the edges unless you have that cut out perfectly so let me show you a better method to make a patch for the next hole so this next product is also a poly amide but this one happens to be nice and evenly transparent all the way through and it comes with some parchment paper so this parchment paper is going to help us get the best patch possible so this next version of poly imide is really transparent all the way through and you know what you can't stretch it as much as the other versions so it may be --have a little bit differently and I'm also going to be using a smaller patch this time just to see in comparison how all these work out in the wash so I've trimmed it out a little larger than the patch I'm going to set it right on top of that so I've got my craft paper my patch the poly amide and then here's a little piece of the parchment paper that came with the product so this is going straight face down on this I'm taking my wool setting on my iron and setting that in place for ten seconds and I can lift that off and now this has become the perfect patch so what I can do now is I can trim this all the way up to the edges and now I can very carefully peel off that parchment expose the adhesive underneath now I'm ready to go ahead and patch it on to this hole well that looks really nice you know what the entire surface is stuck all the way around let's see what it looks like from the front so the next product I'll demonstrate for you is called mending tape now this is the product that people would probably point you toward if you told them you had a hole in your shirt you needed to mend and the thing about this though is that it's for woven fabric so that means like a dress shirt type of fabric it comes in all different colors depending on whatever type of shirt you have but the thing about this is that the reason why it might work for this is because the adhesive is a heavy adhesive on the back of it so what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and cut this out and I'm going to do a small circle again because I think that was the most successful of all the patches so far well this one might be the best yet it's the thinnest but you know what it took about 30 seconds of dry heat to get here along with a little bit of pressure so the last two holes are going to be repaired with some cotton thread you see I have some cotton thread I have a very very thin needle I have a magnifying lamp you don't need this but you know what it makes the job so much easier you can look through the magnifying glass and you can actually see every single thread as you go through so now that the thread is through the head of the needle I'm going to the long end of the thread and I'm just going to make a knot so I have thread between my index finger and my thumb I'm going to wrap it around just like so and then I'm going to take it up and twist it and you can kind of see I'm kind of twisting it there take my third finger pull it nice and tight and now I've got a nice knot right there so your engineers the same exact way so the real trick here is to grab one thread from one side and then one thread from the other and pull it through just like that now don't do it so that it's you know so super tight you just need to grab one little end here and we're not wanting to pucker the fabric so much so you're just going to go ahead and kind of go back and forth until you can't see the hole any longer so just back and forth here grabbing a little loop on either side running that needle through the loop till you get to the end of the hole all to finish it off I'm going to go through this kind of mending area not into the t-shirt fabric itself do one loop and then try to pull that a little bit tight and then come back through go through the loop and pull that nice and tight now I can trim it off the repair is complete but let's see what it looks like from the front side well there you have it let's iron it and see if we can get that to flatten out now I'm on the last hole I'm working on the back side again I'm getting this all set with my toothpick and I'm going to press it in place this last one I'm going to do with fabric glue so your typical fabric glue that you can get at the fabric store I'm just going to dab it on there and let it dry so here's the t-shirt fresh out of the dryer now I have this on a normal wash cycle along with a high heat dry cycle so let's do a side-by-side comparison on the backside of the shirt and see how these repairs held up so here's the 100% polyester lightweight patch here's the 100% polyester medium weight patch here's the 100% polyester heavyweight patch here's the poly amide patch that we made from the loose weave fabric here's the poly amide patch that we made from the transparent fabric and here's the mending tape and here's the hand stitched version and then there's the glued version so you can make your own mind up about what looks best from the back and what you think is going to hold up over time but then let's look at the front and they all look pretty similar these patches are going to actually prevent this t-shirt from unraveling a little further but you can see as you get a little heavier weight in your patches from underneath you're going to notice the outlines so in looking at this t-shirt not only from the front but from the back I really think that there are three successful repairs here the first one being the 100% lightweight polyester patch this one actually blends in seamlessly with the t-shirt fabric you can't even tell it's there the second one I would say would be the glue now the glue there's only one problem with it it dries shiny so if you have a little opening in the front of your shirt you might have a little glisten of glue that you can kind of detect there but otherwise it looks really great and the third one is the hand stitch version now this one is going to definitely be the most secure over time they look identical all of them from the front so you can choose whichever one you want and here your old t-shirt and wear it again and again and even during laundering this will hold us and if none of those options appeal to you well then you can go ahead and you can get a bunch of beads and you can bedazzle your shirt wherever you have a hole well there you have it eight ways to repair a hole in a

"all right guys um i'm excited today i'm in my lab i've had these sheets now since january or february i had forgotten why i had ordered them with the madness of coronavirus but then i decided to start looking through and seeing where my cost went and i remembered i had these guys what i have in my hand right now okay these are called reveal s sheets okay reveal s sheets these are sheets used with sublimation ink to sublimate on light garments like sublimation but on cotton guys let me repeat that these are a no weed one step process from printer to press with sublimation ink on to cotton light colored of course and so today we're gonna put this to the test i'm gonna sublimate on a hundred percent cotton no weeding so let's see how this goes guys we'll be right back i got the press getting heat up um i'm just going to print my standard uh logo i'm not sure what i'm going to print on here i don't want to waste a lot so when i try to bring you guys these videos you know i use a small scale because i'm always testing different things and obviously to keep it affordable for me because i'm not giving these things for free except for once all right how these work you're going to print on the dull side so it has a shiny side and like a off-white opaque looking doll side you're going to print on that side and mirror your image like you would sublimation all right so what i'm going to do is um i've created my image i'm doing an 11 by or eight and a half by 11 image on a white cotton t-shirt i'm going to print and send to my sublimation printer i don't i don't know if you guys can see that but i'm sending it one second sending it to my sublimation printer okay but before i hit print i do have to come put the sheet in again i'm printing on the dole white-ish looking side so i'm going to place it with the shiny side up in my case because my printers go you know draws it in so i'm putting the shiny side up as you see sublimation paper is face down so i'm putting the print sheet i need in here all right and i'm going to print you okay it's coming here it is so i don't know kind of looks like uh over uh like uh you know those little projector things in school that's what it looks like all right i'm gonna grab my cotton shirt and i'll be right back all right guys every single rule with sublimation applies so you guys can see i am using i don't know if y'all can see that there 100 cotton okay heavy cotton or ultra colon i have pre-pressed my garment already the press is at 380 385 to 400 i'm just going to try it at 380. the instructions say 400. now with sublimation is usually 60 seconds with this is 18 seconds guys 18 seconds 385 to 400 degrees i'm gonna place it on here you guys can see i'm not worried about where it's all right i'm going to put parchment paper i'm not sure if it's going to bleed through the back or not um so we're just putting parchment and hoping for the best okay again 380 not 60 seconds 18 seconds heavy pressure we'll be right back guys all right i left it for 20 seconds and you can peel it while it's hot wait a minute there's some error maybe not too too hot okay we're gonna just press it one quick time here and wait a little bit to cool it's hot peel but i'm gonna wait all right i'm gonna wait a little bit before i peel it though it's hot peel so i'm not sure bring it over here all right let's peel all right guys i messed it up by letting it cool down i should have hot peeled it not sure what's up with this little guy up here definitely not the right way i'm gonna research a little more and be right back it went good all right guys the first time was an error my press was set to um 375 so we're gonna see if it really if it really matters the time or these sheets suck we'll see but every video i watched it came out smooth i think 10 degrees matters probably guys here goes 15. meant to put it to 18 seconds i didn't put no cover sheets so wish me luck and it says to pull off hot one continuous pool negative oh my god guys okay it freaking worked i just sublimated can you guys see that on a hundred percent cotton guys okay so the problem with this image was i was doing 18 seconds it's 25 seconds as well as very light color does not appear so it has to be dark vibrant colors guys i am stoked holy heck so i pretty much take the printer sheet these clear sheets they're called reveal s put it with the shiny side up on your printer or you have to print on the dull side like the white side mirrored of course then you put it on your shirt this way down press it for 25 seconds 385 380 sorry for 25 seconds and peel hot in one fast you know one continuous motion i didn't weed it anywhere that the ink wasn't there's no texture i need to wash this and then i'll be right back all right a few things i want to add blend roll if you don't let rule obviously just like regular sublimation it's not gonna happen as well as you must pull with the fabric instead of against it i pulled against it but i am in awe this was done with a converted workforce 7720 with sublimation ink", "VnJhfy7R2wE": "today we're talking about the next level lady is 100% ring-spun cotton t-shirt now this is our go to lady style t-shirt one because of the price - because of the fabric the fit everything about this shirt is great for large groups instead of just telling you though I do have Maia coming over she's gonna show this off first thing you'll notice is great fit first because this side seam here now that means it's going to naturally hug your curves any lady shirt shouldn't be baggy like a unisex style it should naturally hug and this sure does that the next thing you'll notice is the neckline here it's a little lower than the American Apparel 100% ladies neckline the American Apparel is a little tighter this does offer a little more breathability so if you're looking for a hundred percent ring-spun cotton ladies t-shirt this is our go to it also it's a better price point than the American Apparel ladies hundred percent the other thing you're gonna see is just the sleeve length flattering it hits you right at the right part of the arm not too high not too low fits great feels great hundred percent ring-spun means that basically if you're thinking about sizing we do suggest maybe getting one size up so normally Maia would wear maybe like a small but in this we have her in a medium today just because with that cotton and just doesn't stretch as much so that's one thing to note with this if you order familiar drew sometimes err on the side of bigger because it's never fun to get a shirt good with this though we recommend any type of our eggs vintage or standard vintage being the lighter ink coat standard being a normal print a little thicker ink to make it pop but with this also comes in two 100% ring-spun this is a heathered garment and athletic gray meaning at any time we have a heathered means this could be 90 10 90 cotton poly which just means it's gonna have a little more stretch but still offers kind of that more snug fit great shirt overall one of our best selling ladies shirts and you can see why great price point great fit the neckline is awesome everything about it might look awesome in it I'm a co-ed monkey soft scale we rate this t-shirt a - thanks for watching this video please let us know if you have any questions because here at co-ed monkey soft matters and so do our customers", "37iSVSnu1KI": "Aloha friends good morning I wanted to share a pinterest finds for you guys today you guys know how much I love my Pinterest I am on Pinterest every day I have about 35,000 pins in my my account and many boards and one that caught my eye a few months ago and I've been wanting to do it and show you guys is how to turn a stiff shirt this one is very stiff into one of those soft vintage feel like this one this is so soft it's like a baby's blanket this is my son Jonathon shirt now my boys my boys love to wear t-shirts and they tend to go to like the character t-shirts like these are Batman Marvel Comics and all that stuff because of the way it's made a lot of these shirts are very soft and vintage looking and so when they wear it specially here where we live during the summertime it goes up to like 90 95 degrees it's very hot it's very humid they don't want to wear something like this that's so heavy for them and so thick this is one of my husband's favorite shirts because of course it says Hawaii it's a Hawaiian shirt actually says Hawaiian strength but he had gotten this in Hawaii during one of his visits there and he has a love and hate relationship with this shirt he loves it but then he hates to wear it so I figured I'd wanted to since I saw this on Pinterest I wanted to go ahead and surprise him turn this hard feeling t-shirt into a soft vintage one alright the recipe to turn your hard shirts into a soft vintage feel only requires two ingredients four cups of water and half a cup of salt place everything into your container I'm just using one of my kitchen Pyrex because it's the right size for me and mix it well make sure the salt is well dissolved into that water okay the salt is fully dissolved I have my shirt here my husband's shirt and I'm going to go ahead and fold it nice and flat so that it soaks into that water and just make sure that your um your shirt is fully covered in that water okay and we're supposed to brine it we're supposed to brine it for three days and brining is just a process of just letting it sit I'm going to go ahead and let it sit outside it's a nice weather outside it's not hot it's not cold and then every evening I'm just going to put it put it inside or else I can also place it in my laundry room so either way where you guys decide to place it just make sure that um once in a while every day or two just Pat it in and make sure all the the fabric is covered and I will see you guys in three days Aloha friends it has been three days this thing has really soaked in well it's been brining and now I'm going to go ahead and give it a regular wash and it's supposed to have a vintage feel to it let's go see how it works out alright friends here is the final result went ahead and washed it twice and the result I'm pretty happy with them okay with it I think it actually did work it's not vintage soft soft but it is it is a lot softer than what it originally was and I have to take into consideration that I did start off with a very heavy cotton shirt this was very thick it wasn't just the regular cotton t-shirt this one was super thick but hubby have already tried it and he can't feel the difference specially along along the sleeves this DIY of turning your your regular t-shirt into vintage vintage t-shirt does work at some point it won't turn it super vintage like you know like this super thin but it does you know line it up a bit maybe I'll even try one day of just doing another batch of the the salt and and the water brine and see how it does work but um for now I'm pretty happy with it so I give it thumbs up thank you guys for watching this quick video of how to turn your regular t-shirt into vintage shirts and like I said I think it works and I hope you guys try to Maha", "cpbUjORGrC0": "what's good youtube what y'all up to what y'all been doing when i'm back with another video that i slide through another time i hope y'all ain't sick of me i hope y'all ain't trying to feed me up here cause i need your help with something i need y'all to run me up to a thousand subscribers let's do that you know tomorrow yeah it

rapidly um we just gonna go from the 600 to 1000 the subscriber giveaway that way we can get everything keep coming we keep the motivation to get to this thousand year day but road to a thousand i appreciate y'all again like comment subscribe to that channel let somebody know i need a little bit of help you know what i mean if they can start a gofundme for subscribers i would sign up you know i'm at that point no i'm just playing i just appreciate y'all rocking with me i really do yeti but um first things first shout out to the squad mike tease uh see paris uh 12 going to pearl j styles all things styles you did say how you feel tv say how you feel baby but yeah so in this video let me get right to it because i know i'll be holding y'all but i've been having so much fun this is so much fun if you want to start a youtube channel you haven't did it yet started it's fun my god yeah but check them out today we are going to be of course supplement y'all know i'm in love with sublimation right now um but i've been back and forth with vinyl don't get me wrong i still bang with vinyl that's my my first you know what i started with but i do love sublimation but anyway uh today we're gonna try another method of supplementing on a hundred percent carb cotton uh dark garment we're gonna try something called b flex sublimation flop i want to make sure i said it right because it's not b flex flop it's b flex sublimation flop it's made to sublimate on now full disclosure um i got it over there at the vinyl stand hit that link in the description if you want some boom but um full disclosure it came with no instructions my guy um i really can't find much on b flex flock sublimation but i'm just gonna use my judgment and we're going to get it done but i literally have no instruction um i would find it similar to easy subleave where you can print on it and print cutting all that or the way i like to do it is just lay the easy subway and this up on top of it because for some reason my easy sublease gets jammed in my printer i don't know it don't happen to everybody happy to me i ain't banging with it so if you see my previous video uh sublimating 100 cotton dark colors with easy sublease if you have it first pause it go watch that come back here and we're going to do the exact same process but with the flock yeah so go watch that run them numbers up and then come back over here because i need y'all i need you i need these subscribers anyway um let's get it rocking and rolling so that's what we're gonna do y'all we're actually gonna be sublimating on a black hoodie today so you bang with that you want to see that stay after the intro you know we'll make that happen meet me at the heat press i hope you brought some change i heard you know the toes went up to get to the heat press pay your toes me over there yeti [Music] all right y'all before we go to the heat press i jump the gun i want to show you what we're working with um so this is the b flex sublimation flop i mean don't look like none of y'all look like white piece of paper but y'all i feel like flop very smooth suede like material right so obviously that's the side you sub it on and then it's got this backing on it that hopefully i'll be able to just peel off and apply to my hoodie then once i attack that down i'm gonna go ahead and just the image is upside down this is what we putting on the hoodie wu-tang y'all know wu tang bruce lee kung fu i thought it was dope i want to put this on sean would do it yeah it is so cut it down the size now my um the one i bought it came in a 20 inch roll so you do have to cut this down i use uh my guillotine got a nice little cut on that thing and uh yeah cut it down i think this is a 13 by 13 i did this i want to make it a decent size for the hoodie but not going over the pocket you know so 13 by 13 was good it is so this will sub on top of this coming up all right y'all so i got the press set at 3 20 right now we got it at six seconds because i don't want to burn this i don't know how i don't know the exact settings for this so i'm gonna lay it down first you know i mean six seconds you won't do that grab your hoodie just a black hoodie i picked up from one of the stoves around here one of the stores it felt pretty comfortable and i wanted a black hoodie like i already don't have a thousand of them you didn't roll that thing real quick never used this before y'all and i don't know if i missed it or what it was no instructions in the package and none online for it so if you can find some let me know

welcome back to my channel so this is going to be the design that we're gonna be using today I've already printed it out using my Sawgrass SG 400 that's the sublimation printer I use now I've had people ask me if you could use a regular printer and you cannot I'll insert a picture of it somewhere in here so you guys can see which one I'm using I've got tons of videos on it so I've already printed out my design is ready to go the paper I use as Tex print are I'm going to be using my Cricut ten by twelve quick and easy press today for the design so we're gonna be using that and I'm gonna be using my 14 by 14 polka dot mat as well and then the shirts that I'm using these are the Gildan so when you first get them they look like this I'm gonna be doing the bleach method today and this is how they look when you first purchase them they are Gildan soft style ring-spun so they look just like this okay I'll have a link down below where i order my shirts I'm not affiliated anyway but they are super fast and that's just where I order them these are 65% polyester and 35% cotton as well as they are color you want to stick with like a light color a high polyester count so this is the ones that I'm using today they look like this when you first start out so you can put it on here and it will look super cute if you want to do what's popular right now and do the bleach method this is how they're going to look now I've done a video already showing you how to do this but I've actually changed the way that I'm bleaching these now so I actually don't even do it that way now so what I do and I'll just tell you really quickly and then I'll actually do an updated video very very soon so the way that I do this is I just put a hanger on it like normal I go and hang it outside on a tree like a small tree like a little branch you could be doing this um you can use like those those clothes racks that you get at Walmart that you know those little metal racks you could use those you could get them as cheap as like eight dollars I think 810 dollars so you get one of those clothes racks hang it on there so what I do is I have it on the hanger I hang it on a tree branch where I can reach it obviously and then I take a a bleach bottle like I did before and then I just lightly spray in this area and then I kind of spritz here and there just to get like these little spritz marks here I'll change the dial on my spritzer so it'll have a straight stream and then that's how I kind of get some of these spots like this so this is what the bottom of the t-shirt looks like just like this and then the top part where the design goes that's what a lot of people are doing just like this and then on the backside since it's hanging from the tree I'm not a lot of the bleach comes through there so it's just ro bite and then I took my spritzer and just kind of went like this with the sprays and that's how I came out with this really cool effect so it's super cute on the back love it but it's set out there I let it set out there and kind of dry just a little bit then I brought it inside now if you're doing a ton of these you don't have to do this stuff but this is what I did I brought it inside hung it up and then use my blow dryer to dry them really quick I like the ones with the attachments like this so where you have them on here so it gives it a nice string that's straight in my spot I always talk about that and then I just go you could use like a heat gun and stuff just don't get too too close so you're just gonna use your hairdryer I go over the whole shirt drying it really quickly and what that does is it intensifies the bleach and really helps bleach this out so I found it the best way and then when I'm done I take it over to my sink and I rinse it with cold cold water rinse rinse rinse rinse rinse until I know all the bleach is out I add just a little dot of the Dawn dishwashing detergent just a dot and then I just kind of wash it at my sink it's wet like this really well rinsing and washing and kind of carefully gently going like this until it's completely rinsed out there's no more soap bubbles and then I ring it and ring it ring it gently because I'm not want to get crazy just spots like this and I'm kind of pushing any water out like this as much as I can and then I just throw it the dryer just like that because it's clean I did the Dawn dish soap and everything so then I just throw it in the dryer with some towels or something and it's good to go that's how I'm doing mine like I said I will do an updated video very soon but I wanted to throw that out there just so you guys had that okay so let's get going so I've got my Cricut easy press on 350 for 60 seconds any taking my 14 by 14 mats I'm gonna get that down here you're gonna want to protect that surface with some butcher paper and then I'm gonna go ahead and get down my t-shirt get that up here like so take your lint roller and go over the entire shirt to make sure there's no lint especially if you put it in there with some towels probably bad but that's what I do so definitely go over it with a lint roller make sure you get off any lint and that's gonna avoid those little blue dots that you'll get okay so our t-shirts ready to go I'm gonna go ahead and pre-press it really fast to get out any moisture just like that so just pull down any moisture that was remaining and now we're ready to go so what I like to do is take my design here and I'm gonna fold it in half obviously it's not from the paper to paper it's right here so I'm gonna just I get it like this fold it in half where I can see my design I'm gonna line those up make sure my papers up here at the top make sure those are lined up and I'm gonna get a crease so that way I know where my Center is up go ahead and take my Cricut ruler that I've talked about before today I'm do it using these six by 26 looks good I've got it even up there at the top then I'm gonna go ahead and take my design we're gonna put it upside down I'm gonna line up that crease mark just getting that right up there at the top like so all right I'm gonna go ahead and take some heat transfer tape you can either get it from Amazon and rolls like this you can also get it from Cricut or you can pick it up at Michael's or Cricut calm I'll have it both of these linked down below so just gonna go ahead and give me some heat transfer tape like this and cut that down and I'm gonna get one on each side so I'm just gonna go ahead and get one here and one here all right so we're ready to go now that I've got this down all I'm gonna do is take a piece of butcher paper on top I will have this link below as well I buy the big rolls of this from heat press nation so now we're ready so we're gonna do is 350 for 60 seconds and you want to keep it as still as possible all right so very carefully we don't lift this up we're gonna go ahead and pull off our butcher paper all right so I'm going to go ahead and peel up our design just like that super cute don't worry about this right here so it looks like it burned the shirt so this will actually wash out whenever you go to do it I don't know what it is between this and the bleach I actually have it do this to me earlier and all I did was take it over to the sink just to double-check it would come out and it did so I took it over to the sink washed this out thing between the bleach and the press but like I said once I wash this it did come right out so don't worry about it at all so I'm gonna go ahead and go wash this really fast I'm gonna come back as soon as it's dry and show you guys that this is just gonna come right back out we wouldn't do that really quick and I will be right I am back so it felt seconds for you but it was about an hour or so for me so I washed the t-shirt and it completely came out I don't know why it does that I think it's some sort of chemical reaction with that bleach that it does it but it's not stained it will come out so if you guys do this where you bleach it first and then you put this on make sure you wash the t-shirt bleach it wash the t-shirt and then do it but even when you do that if it does that like I said it's some sort of chemical reaction but when you go wash this it's gonna completely come out what I do is I take it over to the sink again add a little bit of that Dawn dish soap and I brought the t-shirt together very carefully rubbing like this all the way around and then I wash wash wash in the sink wring it out and then I threw it back in the dryer now I probably could have just thrown this into the wash and it would have just done it on its own that way but since I was kind of quick for the video I did it that way so if you need to do it that way as well you can I just put a little bit darkness up like I said just one dog and then I moved it around the shirt and kind of wash while I was already wet and then just rinsed all the way around and like I said I don't know why it does that but it has to be some sort of chemical reaction now it's only gonna do that obviously if you bleach the shirt and then do it so if you do like we did before we use sublimate and then bleach the shirt you're not gonna have these issues at all you don't want to fuss with that I would definitely recommend that you go ahead and sublimate your t-shirt for first and then do the and then do the bleach because it's going to come out the same either way but you're not going to have to fuss with the extra steps of washing it again cute like I said I absolutely love the bleach effect this is what the back side of the t-shirt looks like it's super adorable I love it so I hope you guys enjoy this I hope you guys found it helpful if you did please hit the like

level apparel i am five two and roughly 141 um so take that into consideration and i wear an extra small this one i'm gonna be trying on is an extra small so the next level t-shirt fits very well i really really like it i like how it's hugging my neck um and it's also hugging my arms it feels really good like it feels really really really good it almost feels like bella canvas but it's not bella canvas type material like i said it's hundred percent cotton i can't remember what the other material it was made out of the uh the bella canvas one but if you go back to that video or you just do a quick just quick google search you can find out what type of material it is it's very soft i can really appreciate this shirt it might be my go-to shirt my go-to second shirt if i don't want to you

it's like on me so the next i have on is the elo um 50 combed cotton and 50 polyester again this is an extra small it feels good the fabric makes a difference i like the i like the polyester cotton blend um right now it's hot in my garage i don't know if it's making me sweat but it seems like it's kind of holding heat but at the same time it's not um it feels good around my arms it's not hugging like the uh like the other one was then the next level apparel um this one is a little bit looser which is fine but it's not like crazy loose my only concern would be is it going to loosen over time right here because i like it to be tight like the other shirts um the other shirt i would be i like my shirts to be tight like the other shirt um i don't know but all around if it's it's a good it feels good like i have no complaints it's it doesn't feel lashy it's it's loving my body okay it's loving me it's loving me so this next one is going to be by mno gold it is a extra small again and this is going to be 100 pre-shrunk cotton pre-shrunk cotton i'm feeling it kind of in my hands right now and it feels a little rough it feels yeah this this one is really hot this this one's hot it's hot in my garage but this is this is hot um the cut is fine the cut is fine but it just seems like once i dry it one time it's gonna it's gonna start fading it kind of it's kind of it's kind of lighter than the other two i would have to say that this this one is a lighter black of the two is an ashy black that's the only way i can describe it the other two are pretty deep and they feel good like the touch of them of these two shirts are amazing this one's like it's kind of rough and i don't like it if i had to rack them stack the way that i would stack it my number one would be next level apparel my next one would be the elo my number two and then this one is just number three my number one out of all six that i've done so far is the bella canvas okay bella canvas i love it

snug after i've dried it i have no complaints for next level and elo try them out y'all again thank y'all for watching", "OGDhx9fpP88": "hey guys it's becky with design bundles and today i'm going to talk to you about bleached t-shirts now this is not necessarily a new craze but these always flare up around the fall and you know why that is because they make nice distressed designs okay distressed fall they really go hand in hand so now is the time if you have not done so already grab your bleach grab your t-shirt and let's go ahead and get started okay so here i am on designbundles.net and i scored myself this really awesome leopard or cheetah print uh pumpkin okay and of course i i'm really loving let me show you guys this up close i'm really loving this um cheetah leopard print and the hearts so of course i had to grab it too so i have my pattern and i have my pumpkin and i'm going to go ahead and purchase these so that we can get started okay now once i'm in silhouette studio now you can do this in any designing software it's completely up to you but i'm going to set these up to be sublimation prints so i'm going to go to file and merge because i already have a window open so i can merge instead of i'm going to open like normal and i've already unzipped these you guys saw me do that so i'm going to i like to use the png formats and i want to use is that the pink one i'm going to use this orange one here now they usually import pretty large so if it takes a minute don't be alarmed all right so this one is not bad at all i am going to shrink it down just a little bit and i also want to merge in my pumpkin let's see jpeg and png i do like to use the png those usually have a transparent background it doesn't matter for this in particular but it could matter in the future now i know probably what you're thinking the pattern and the pumpkin don't match up very well that's okay because it's not going to be that big of a deal once we get to the actual project so what i like to do is this is going on an adult large shirt so i'm going to size it and i also need to change my page setup because i will be printing on a large format as a matter of fact let me set the custom okay can i go 13 inches wide i'm going to change my machine to none there we go 13 by 19. okay this is the size that i'm going to print and i want my pumpkin to be let's say let's do 9 inches now i do want to say this is going to be a little bit smaller than 9 inches because it's measuring the outside borders here so what i can do if that concerns me is i can draw a box that is nine inches line that up with my pumpkin and then i can size my pumpkin manually so that it's closer to the nine inch mark so my clipboard is actually nine point eight four seven that's okay that's not a big deal just something to know when you're using clip art and i am going to go ahead and flip it horizontally okay so with that in place what i'm going to do is i am going to make this pattern a little bit larger and i'm also going to duplicate it now the only reason i'm doing that is because i do want to have longer pieces and i want to use up the rest of my space down here now silhouette studio will only print what is on the page so just something to keep in mind make sure everything is on there and i'm literally going to fill up the rest of the area with this awesome cheetah pattern i keep saying cheetah is it cheetah or is it leopard all right so i'm going to print now i do have to select my sublimation printer see there we go i'm going to go to preferences and every time that i print after restarting my software i need to re-choose my super b 13 by 9 and 13 by 19 i mean and then premium presentation paper matte i'm going to choose okay hit apply and then i can hit print that's going to send over to my printer and of course we will reconvene and i'm going to show you not only pressing this on the shirt but then applying the bleaching process okay so what i have here is my sublimation print now this is the shirt that i'm going to use this is a style that i really like especially this orange it is a gildan soft style and it is 65 polyester and that leaves 35 cotton now there are reasons why you want to use a blended shirt like this first of all you need the cotton or to be able to bleach it second of all you need the polyester in order to be able to sublimate it but do remember that because you're not subbing on 100 polyester your print is not going to be as bright now for a bleach shirt that's fine and that's why we're doing the bleach so that you can see the design a little bit better but just be prepared for that now i'm going to trim all the way around all right now that is because sometimes and i find this a lot with sublimation printers you can get a little bit of ink around the outside of your paper and i would rather not have that happen so i just trimmed around each side and we will sublimate this part first and of course i have some butcher paper over here so what you're seeing down here on the bottom is just a heat safe mat that i have i'm going to grab my cricut easy press it is already heated up to 400 degrees for 60 seconds i'm going to fold my shirt in half it's kind of my thing i mean not my thing it's a thing okay that way i can get a crease before i sublimate my design on there so here we go i'm just going to pre-press that section and it doesn't have to be for the full time you just want to press it get some of the moisture out of there and give yourself that nice pressing line and just works out really good it's a good habit to have okay with that taken care of i will smooth this out and i'm going to go ahead and sublimate first yes you heard that correctly i'm going to sublimate my design first now i'm going to take my design now this is a design that i printed sometimes you can get them pre-printed from certain areas okay if you want you can use an adhesive to keep it here i'm not moving this shirt so this will be fine for me i'm going to cover it with butcher paper and then heat press my design now sublimation does not take a lot of pressure but you do need consistent pressure another good thing about these bleach shirts is that if this is one of your first time sublimating then it doesn't have to come out perfect because bleach shirts are supposed to look distressed so it just works out really good as a beginner project okay now be careful when opening your heat press or removing your ez press because since we did not use any type of adhesive or heat safe tape we do not want this design to shift okay so on this part we are a done deal now you cannot reuse this butcher paper you see you have the ink on there that transferred and that's okay just know that that's a thing all right there is our beautiful pumpkin now what we want to do and i'm going to start small just to show you guys i'm actually going to tear around this design okay because i do not want it to look like um just a rectangle obviously i actually prefer these to look like stripes all right so there's one we can use this one for another one and it just gives it a rough edge instead of just a bland okay and of course i have this entire sheet over here that i can do the same thing to i can make these a little larger and i probably don't even need all of these i tear them into little triangles and i'm not going to use the ones with the blunt edges like that okay so i can use as many of these or as few of these as i want to i'm just going to go around the shirt and press these on now let me also say if i was using a different shirt especially a white shirt or a light gray shirt you do want to use butcher paper or a different type of blowout paper in between your shirt layers i don't have to do that with this one i've worked with this one before and it is not going to bleed through to the back but just something to keep in mind and i like to do that kind of test anytime [Music] i'm working with a new shirt you do want to make sure you get some along the bottom now my shirt just my shirts seem to bunch so i'm just going to put some off to the side over here now our sublimating is done all right this is our our final effect we got a couple stripes up here and a couple stripes down here all right now don't worry if they look a little staged after the bleaching process they will blend in a little bit more and i promise this shirt is going to turn out great so i'm going to go ahead and prep the bleaching area and then i'll show you guys the setup that i use okay so the basics are you need it to be sunny outside obviously you don't want to be raining you need good weather conditions you also need a bleach safe environment now on top of just this piece of hardboard that i have you'll notice that i'm inserting a piece of cardboard into my shirt that's just going to act as a barrier so that whenever i spray especially the main middle pumpkin there it's not going to saturate through my shirt all the way to the back in addition to that make sure you're wearing bleach safe clothes in my video there was a little bit of wind blowing and i didn't have any blow back but that is a real possibility that you could blow the bleach that you spray back on the clothes you're wearing i also try to give my shirt a little bit of character so you'll notice i have done the pinch and twist on three of the areas and that's just going to give some areas where the bleach cannot reach and it just gives it a little bit of texture now i'm using straight bleach this is also cheap bleach i have heard that the high-powered bleach is more potent so definitely keep that in mind and i'm spraying all the areas that i have sublimated on including i'm trying to carefully go around my pumpkin and make sure i get that area really really well but you're going to notice that i give it a pretty good overall spray down i don't really well it's not that i don't like them i personally am not a fan of creating the shirts that just have the block of bleach right there in the middle and nothing else so i just really think that adding more bleach gives it some character you see i do a little bit of misting here now if you want some true misting you'll want to make sure to choose a spray bottle that has a really fine mist i'm going to come back and do that in just a minute i like to do my bleaching in stages so i'm doing one overall bleach right now and then i will actually come back and add a little bit more bleach in just a minute wow did you notice the change there so i had set it up on a time lapse but the gradual change wasn't quite as impactful so um it did occur now that probably took about five minutes what i'm doing is i'm going back and i'm re-saturating the areas where i've sublimated and this is with a a smaller bottle so i have more control over where i'm spraying and i'm going to let this sit for just a minute but another important thing to remember is when you take this inside you do want to at a minimum rinse it with cold water and then some people talk about also adding peroxide to neutralize the bleach i haven't had to do that but it's just something to keep in mind if you are in the mood to experiment but also as you're carrying it inside make sure that you do not dislodge the cardboard piece inside because your shirt will still be wet and also make sure that you don't brush the shirt up against your clothing because obviously it's covered in bleach so overall just try to keep an eye on your shirt and after you see a little bit of the transformation you can also straighten it out flatten it out and you know take a look i like to do that because it gives me a better idea of how the bleach process is going because i can compare my bleached area against the unexposed areas and see how much change there really was now here we are on the inside i have already rinsed this with cold water i feel like i got pretty good results on my bleach shirt you can see i got a pretty good bleach around the design okay and i don't like it when it's just a plain circle right in the middle of your t-shirt i do like these lighter colors i think they bleach really well and it's not a stark contrast so i'm very happy with how this turned out and i'm going to throw it through the washer and dryer and then we will take another look so uh do you like it i mean i i'm not gonna lie not everybody is with the bleach shirt craze all right that's okay there's no judgment in this zone this is the safe zone okay now if you like it you kind of get addicted to it pretty fast and if you live in florida like me then you know having all the sunshiny days to sweat your ear off bleaching shirts i mean it just depends on how you feel about that so all right well i really appreciate you watching today if you have any questions or comments make sure you leave them below and i will come back in and check with you guys but also make sure you subscribe to the channel because we have a lot of really fun tutorials for you right around the corner thanks again we'll see you next time you", "jx6u8fXNl94": "what's up guys Rob's you graph here with three storm fitness with anybody t-shirt that I've been wearing a lot for the last few days I just got a six pack of these from my dad went up and a half my wardrobe comes from my dad he's like God if there's like a shirt or a brand he's total brand and if there's something he loves like I'll get a car full of them like when I see him don't wait here here's a stack of t-shirts ER like I haven't had this LL Bean Katahdin hoodie which I've reviewed before yeah I told him I needed a new hoodie exactly when I went for Christmas you got two of those they're great by the way I did another review review all those while back anyways these are Kirkland Signature white t-shirts my dad is a obsessed with Kirkland Costco you know it Silva Costco he loves Kirkland so he loves these shirts he's a chameleon of them and now I have six of them they are they are fantastic he does know his stuff is good taste and value work value fashion first of all thing I love about these is they're long I'm a tall guy this one has not been washed have not washed this one yet so right now you're looking at an extra-large I'm six for about 255 and so extra large you could see I'm for those of you who are you know big big boys and girls out there who know that like I don't necessarily need an X double X L for most of my shirts because of you know my overall volume it's usually because the two other Street I get a double XL because you know a lot of shirts don't come at all I got to get them I gotta get em tall because I'm tall and especially after they wash them a few times so most of my shirts will just you know be wore like halter tops and I guess that's pretty cool but it's not what I've bought these are amazing it really they are I think the six-pack I think he he got him like some sort of special sale they're like 1850 or something I think they're normally a little bit more but they amount to average about 4 bucks a shirt which is a steal really for the quality of because they're also in addition to being tall and they do shrink a little bit they're 100% cotton hun percent Honduran cotton I mean under us so you know they're good beautiful country other than I'd imagined um but they're very thick very very thick like I said I like back to my original point about shrinking like I said my dad has about two of these wore them for a long time they do shrink a little bit but that's it's it's not it's not anything it's a you know I'm sure you have cotton shirts before you know you know what will happen when you wash and drive over over that durability is it's phenomenal in these like they're you know they are very very thick like I would I don't know if that does anything for you there but um trust trust me they're very thick very very soft and they're so thick that I would almost I play I wear them in the summer the reason we've been doing this is because I go through t-shirts like crazy personal trainers home in the gym all the time I'm trying to like wear anything really nice usually grab a shirt off the top of my clean shirts and go so I'll definitely get plenty of use on these but they are so thick that like they've really be great for like cooler weather because they're they're just they're heavy real heavy duty really a whole lot more to say about it I mean it's a t-shirt you know I think they come in other colors I think I think they come at least I know they come in black but for the price they sell them on Amazon we'll put a link I think they're a little more expensive on Amazon there or Costco but if you don't have a Costco around you we don't have a Costco or anywhere near us and even if we did you got to be a member so you know you pay a little bit more if they're on Amazon but they're still super cheap you may be paying like five bucks of shirt so definitely have my endorsement I would say I'm as excited about these as I get to get a Bella white t-shirt you know they're long so again another good benefit of it is if you got a dress up for like some you know formal event you have plenty of of tuckable material and talking to your pants so I'm just a win all around guys Kirkland Signature Honduran white t-shirts check them out let me know what you think if you got something oh yes you like that put a little Spanish in there for Honduras gunas sorry I'm butchering that see you

"pPCYhGCQ418": "hey y'all it's Betsy from cuttin corners vinyl in Natal in Texas and today is craft Smith season 2 episode 4 and we are going to go over how to DIY bleach dye a shirt and then put a one color graphic on it now I'm going to give you all the instructions pretty much from start to finish but remember with crafts maasai don't show you all the cutting procedures if you need to know that look back at my Cricut or silhouette tutorials or brother scan and cut I give you all the instructions over there now give me a moment and I'll show you how I bleach my shirts [Music] [Applause] so as you can see I have a piece of coroplast and a mustard Bella in canvas shirt now the first thing I'm going to do to do this bleach shirt is I'm going to take and place my shirt over my coroplast you can use cardboard if you've got it I just like to use plastic for it because it seems to make it a little bit where the bleach doesn't absorb into the paper and kind of keeps the bleach a little bit more where I want it so I'm just taking and putting this on and if you can hear the air conditioner I'm sorry but it's hot so I run my AC there we go okay so as you can see I have it loaded on to the cardboard now the first thing that we want to do is now that we have it all smoothed out it's going to decide on how we're wanting our design are we wanting to just bleach the bottom half of this chart which you can easily do are we wanting to bleach a center circle which is what I'm wanting to do but then we want splatters other places I am using the Clorox cleanup spray with bleach this makes it a little bit simpler instead of worrying about a actual bleach bottle so what I'm going to do is start making my circular pattern now this is not an exact science so each one is unique when you do it like this which is part of the fun of doing it so as you can see I have a pretty equal circular design with a little bit of overspray where we're going to get a few extra bleach spots now I'm going to take and stand a little bit further away with my bleach bottle about two feet from it and just kind of spritz all the other places to kind of give it that unique bleached love [Music] okey-dokey so now that my shirt has all the bleach on it I'm going to let it sit till I reach the desired whiteness that I want so and once that happens then I'll wash the shirt but as of right now we're going to leave it alone just like it is and let it set for a little bit and then we'll come back to it so as you can see this is what the shirt looks like at this point you can see that it is bleached out this color to more of a pale yellow and then on the spots that are completely dry they are white now this is still damp so I'll probably let it set till it's completely dry and then throw it through the washing machine but I wanted you to see at this progress because I won't get to film this again till it's washed and dry now to remember this that if you are applying vinyl over this shirt you are going to want to wash it with regular washing detergent with no fabric softener so if you're using the pods don't use the pots because fabric softener will mess with the adhesion of your vinyl so this is what it looks like at this point and this belt in canvas that I am using is a hundred percent cotton so it may take longer to achieve this shade of lightness if you are using a 50-50 shirt it may take less time I've only worked with 100% cotton doing this bleaching method but as you can see we have a nice spot to be able to put a design on and it has this really unique look to it this is what the t-shirt looks like after it's been washed and dried with the bleach spray used on it now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and line it up just like I would any other shirt on my steady Betty with the collar off and the tag let's make that down just a little bit there we go and the shoulder seams even now one thing I am gonna do that I normally don't because it to me it's not really necessary but because this has been washed and dried I want to iron out the wrinkles so I'm just taking my easy press which is preheated to 332 Gries for 15 seconds but this is such an easy thing to do and we'll take and make you a lot of money now I'm using my 15 inch t-shirt guide lined up with the edges of my study buddy which my study buddy is a 15 by 24 inch and that's why I use the 15 inch now I'm taking my design folding it with the sticky side out and giving myself a crease now I'm going to load that Center crease mark up on my t-shirt guide and use about three fingers to measure down now this file is available on my patron for $10 or more patreon patreon supporters or you can purchase it from my website same thing with the vinyl I am using the brown glitter flecks ultra so we're just going to hold this on this section for 15 seconds and then on the other section for 15 seconds at 330 degrees now this process is mainly to show you the glitter process not the glitter process with the bleaching process but I wanted to show you how cute you could make these and this is something that is so popular right now you could make a whole lot of money selling these okay there we go now I'm going to take and remove my clear backing off of here perfect cover it again with my Teflon sheet 15 seconds on each side because again my ez press is 9 inches by 9 inches if you have a 12 inch you wouldn't need to do this you could do your whole design because this design is cut at 10 and a half inches wide there we go okay turn that off look how good that looks with just one simple color and you can see that that bleach process really did work out well for this shirt now give me a moment we'll go over everything that we've done there are a couple of things to remember about when you are bleaching this shirt I always wash and dry mine you don't have to but remember if you put too much bleach it can't eat holes into your shirt that's why I recommend washing and drying and whenever you wash them you can use soap but do not use anything that has fabric softener in it it will mess with the adhesion of your vinyl but I love how this turned out and I know this week's been a lot of shirts and there will be another one tomorrow because we're doing our crafting for Disney we're throwing those in with our craftsmen to kind of keep things moving along but just remember it's not all about shirts but this is such a cool process and it's so popular right now I wanted to make sure to show it to you now remember if you like this video don't forget to give it a

follow the instructions on the cricut website for the infusible ink markers and I actually made this in Adobe Illustrator and then exported it as a PNG uploaded that PNG into my Cricut design space and then had the black marker draw it out and so this is what the original image looked like you can see it's very sharp it was a one-point tip so it's gonna be bolder I colored in these areas because I wanted those filled a little bit but the rest of the outline is from the marker and so I followed instructions and put the card stock underneath the shirt and it actually bled through onto the cardstock so it's important to have that card stock there I would maybe even double up if you have card stock to spare and so that that was the first one I did and it actually bled through some onto the butcher paper too so I'll tell you what I did after that in just a minute but this is how it came out and with this light it looks pretty bold pretty solid but it's actually more of a more of like a faded black at this point although it looks really good on the camera so I also made spots to put on and the reason that this one did not come out so well is because it was on the crease and I did not apply pressure to the heat press that I was using the Cricut ez press I just laid it on there and had a applied the pressure it would be darker right here but um like I said this isn't 100% cotton shirt it's a 3t which I have a toddler and none of cricket's shirts are toddler sizes and so that's why I just went ahead and went with this to see what would happen so ii whenever i was working on the back as you can see it also bled through onto my cloth that i have right here which that's fine but by the time I got to the back I put cardstock on the inside the image down cardstock on top and then I use another piece of clean butcher paper and you can still see where the butcher paper the in fusible ink still faded onto the butcher paper where there was no cardstock and so I did this to kind of preserve the cardstock a little bit longer and you can see that it still gives you that slightly faded look I'm not sure what this will look like after I wash it but I'll definitely wash it by itself inside out but that's when this image got put on here so I would also in the future put cardstock right here if you're using a cricket mat it would definitely come off of this shirt and onto the mat and so I would put cardstock over the mat also maybe a couple of pieces if you have any to spare and that is my review of using crickets and fusible ink markers on 100% cotton so it's definitely a different result than on the polyester shirts but if that's all you've got", "xLOAK8c15IM": "hello everyone in this video I will be talking about our wholesale t-shirts our t-shirts are

of our videos or choose one of YouTube's AI options I think you all know which one you should choose [Music]", "zhj-rK1Mjxw": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to walt and sarah's channel today we are going to be bleaching sublimation designs on our right here we have 65 polyester on the left we have 60 percent this one is a woman's cut and the one on the left is a man's cut not that that matters we have a pumpkin and we also have our cool little design of the truck and it says farm fresh pumpkins so if my audio doesn't match up my movements it is because i actually lost the audio to the first half of this video so i am doing a voiceover now the way we started was we filled up a spray bottle with leech and this was just a cheap spray bottle from amazon nothing fancy it's actually a four pack the one i used last night actually did not work however this one as you will see produced pretty darn good results um the spray nozzle worked perfectly all right so we got our shirts laid out i haven't washed them because they're already you know pre shrunk pre-shrunken however you want to say it so they're laying down flat i have nothing in between the shirts just lay down flat on the concrete those are my toes and i'm trying not to spray my toes so i am spraying the shirts and we're going to get around that sublimation there we're going to spray that so that way that area turns white and that's really going to make our image pop now once you adjust the nozzle you'll see i'm going to do what i call the zaro streaks zoom zoom you can actually see it showing up on camera and that's going to give us like a really crisp design and we're going to let that one go first because i've always heard that 65 polyester works the best but you're gonna see whether or not you know that is true in my opinion you'll just wait you'll just have to see it okay so you're gonna see these darker colors produce this orange but if you wait long enough that orange will turn almost into like a light pink and then keep waiting it will turn into a white this does take time look how fast the 60 polyester is working this is crazy i've done a few of these t-shirts now this is the fastest one i've ever seen turn and it is so stinking cool i mean right there i think like that is perfect and i would just rinse it out let's see what are we doing next this is so weird having to do a voiceover all right so i'm just going to spray it a little bit more we really want to get that bleach design and as you see around the pumpkin with the sunflowers there you can just see how it's starting to soak in and that's that bleach around it is really gonna make that image pop so we're just gonna wait and then we will check back on these designs after i rinse them out throw them in the washer throw them in the dryer then i'm going to show you the final project instead of making you wait through all of that okay look at the one on the left that is so pretty and one on the right just wait just wait all right guys as promised here is the final project so we have our 60 polyester here excuse my shadow all right so unfortunately i didn't rinse this out good enough before i threw it in the washer so while it was sitting there and i was working on other shirts it was still bleaching away so i'm going to show you like this as you can see this is kind of like our original color and it bleached pretty strong so you got that but i mean it doesn't look terrible i would rock it i'm sure walt's gonna love it so we got that and then over here was our 65 polyester and this one turned out so stinking cool like with the streaks and then the spritz super super cool oh this one's also a haines i don't usually work with hanes when i'm doing my custom shirts and this one is that one all right so they turned out pretty freaking cool if i do say so myself very simple and that's it if you are interested in me doing a video from start to finish with making the t-shirts actually putting the shirts together with the sublimation let me know and i will be totally down for that catch all next time bye [Music] you", "0ZKkALOJTm4": "hey guys it's jake in this video i'll be showing you six of my favorite t-shirts and i'll be ranking them on quality fit and price each of these shirts have their own pros and cons which i'll clarify as i talk about them first up is the los angeles apparel one eight zero one g d this is a pretty standard t-shirt it's not incredibly thin like a gildan shirt but also not overly cumbersome like a root porter shirt this shirt is 185 gsm or 6.5 ounces so it has a bit of weight to it but not thick enough to overheat you or feel stiff the makeup is 100 cotton so you need to be careful washing it on hot or you'll risk shrinkage the best washing method for any 100 cotton garment is to wash on cold and hang dry here i'm wearing a size large the sleeves flare out a tiny bit but really not as much as other shirts i'm very picky about my sleeve flaring but i'm comfortable with this amount of flarage the color is a bit on the thicker side hugs my neck but not suffocating me and the length of the shirt is great even though it's a white shirt it's not really see-through like some other cheap white shirts the 1801 gd is fairly true to size from what i can tell this shirt is 24 dollars retail and 7.85 cents wholesale compared to other shirt blanks that range around 6 to 6.5 ounces the wholesale price is sort of in the medium upper price range but you can definitely feel the difference in quality comparison like if you were to compare the laa1801gd at 7.85 cents with the bella canvas 3001 at four dollars the weight difference is night and day the 1801 gd offers a decent selection of colors people tend to prefer neutral colors anyway like black white gray and cream so this blank checks those boxes next is the root porter ultra luxury hoodie this t-shirt is the heaviest blank i'm aware of at the moment if you want a typical street wear look and feel this is your shirt this shirt is 235 gsm or 10.5 ounces which is one of the heaviest sharp links you can buy from any supplier at the moment the makeup is 100 cotton and is already pre-washed so the shrinkage rate is about zero to three percent as dictated on the website i still recommend to wash on cold and hang dry here i'm wearing a size large the sleeves are pretty flarey and it has a baggy oversized fit the collar is thin and hugs my neck not my preferred type of collar i like my collars a little wider to show the collarbones it's more of a boxy cut which some people like it's not my absolute preference but i can't deny the superior quality this shirt is 29 retail and 13.95 wholesale 14 is pretty pricey for just a sharp blink but this is the absolute best shirt you can get as a blank at the moment if you're referring to the quality you can get comparable quality for a little cheaper if you bought bulk wholesale from alibaba but that's not the purpose of this video i'd recommend this shirt if your brand positioning is in the more exclusive luxury market and you price your shirt around 40 to 60 dollars the colors offered are limited to basic neutral colors like white black and cream but they introduce new colors every now and then which are only available on the wholesale store i don't know if these are limited edition colors or if they're permanently added next is the los angeles apparel mt01 yukon army tee this is an interesting shirt it's thick warm and the fit is pretty good this shirt is 230 gsm or 8 ounces the makeup is 90 cotton and 10 polyester this shirt is the softest shirt in this list it's hard to explain it almost feels like a really thin blanket if you plan to try any of these blanks i highly recommend you get this army tee just to see how unique it feels if it's cold outside and you want to wear a shirt underneath your outerwear i definitely pick this shirt first out of all the other choices on this list here i'm wearing a size xl the fit is like a standard shirt sleeves don't flare out as much and the length isn't too long i also like the size of the collar it's a bit on the thicker side and i'm a big fan of how open it is it shows a little bit of the collarbones which i like and chest hair you know if you got any this shirt is 28 retail and 9.70 wholesale i say this price is fair for the quality you get the weight and ounce values are important and can give a general idea of how high the quality of the garment but considering how i know what this feels like it's one of the nicest feeling blanks i've ever felt unfortunately this tea only comes in heather gray which is a huge drawback if this came in other basic colors this would be my absolute go-to shirt for all of my projects next is the gildan 5000 this is going to be your budget shirt if you're just starting out and have close to no capital this is an acceptable starting blank this shirt is 150 gsm or 5.3 ounces and the makeup is 100 cotton there's nothing particularly special about this quality it's not as thin as the bella canvas 3001 shirt which i'll talk about later but it's also not so thick that you'd be complimenting this shirt and referring it to your friends it's just a standard shirt that any club youth group club soccer team or bakery team fundraiser would use here i'm wearing a size xl the sleeves flare out a bit and the collar isn't too thick or too thin and it's not super tight around my neck the white color is a tad bit see-through as with most jeep shirt models the fit is nothing special however you expect the normal shirt to fit that's exactly how it fits this shirt is about a dollar fifty to three dollars retail and that's pretty damn cheap you can find this shirt on most mass clothing distribution websites there's really no need for a wholesale price because it's so damn cheap even though it's so cheap i actually think it's a really good deal i would expect a 5.3 ounce shirt to be maybe four to five dollars but you can get the white color shirt for like a dollar 67 on some vendor size there are plenty of colors to choose from whatever theme or mood you need they definitely have it next is the a.s color classic tee this is a good quality standard tee that you can use in pretty much all of your projects virtually no complaints with this one shirt the shirt is 185 gsm or 6.5 ounces and the makeup is 100 cotton this shirt is super soft like very flowy if that makes sense it moves with your body well and doesn't feel cumbersome at all here i'm wearing a size large the fit on this shirt is great still a standard fit like most shirts in the list the collar is thick but doesn't hug my neck super tightly sleeves have an okay amount of flaring and the length of the shirt is good nothing super special about this shirt it's cheap and feels soft this shirt is 20 retail and 8.85 wholesale which is a great price for a standard yet great quality shirt i tend to use the classic tee and the los angeles apparel 1801gd for lots of my projects and collections i'd say if your shirts are priced 25 dollars to 35 dollars you should definitely use this shirt as your standard go-to blank the shirt has a fair amount of color choices mostly the popular colors some neutral colors and a few brighter tones on an extra related note the as color staple tee seen here in size xl is the exact same as the classic tee except its weight is 6.3 ounces as opposed to the classic 6.5 ounces and it cost 16 retail and 4.95 wholesale as opposed to the classics 20 retail and 8.85 wholesale so if you want a tad bit cheaper version while not sacrificing the quality too much go for the staple tea i actually prefer the staple tea over the classic tea because the collar is a little thinner and more open and since it's only a little bit lighter i prefer the more flowiness of the staple tee this shirt is my usual go-to blank when making collections the final shirt is the bella canvas 3001 this is a lightweight and flowy shirt i feel like this shirt would be best for hot seasons or for people who overheat easily this shirt is 120 gsm or 4.2 ounces with a makeup of 100 cotton watch the shrinking specifically on this blank wash on cold and hang dry here i'm wearing a size xl i like this shirt because it's pretty cheap very light and soft to the touch and i like the way the sleeves lay on my shoulders it's very flowy and stretchy the collar is thin and pretty open very relaxed fit other than that it's another standard shirt fit this shirt is three to four dollars retail and you can find this blank on many clothing distribution websites it's pretty damn cheap so there's no need to get wholesale pricing i think the price to quality trade-off is appropriate this shirt is lighter than the gildan 5000 which is cheaper but this bella canvas 3001 is just more appealing to wear i just love the lightness of it there are a bunch of colors to choose from whatever you want they most likely have it my recommendations if you're just starting out and just want to get product out on a budget get the gildan 5000 as color staple tee or the bella canvas 3001 it just depends on what characteristics you look for in a shirt the gildan 5000 is the cheapest while the as color staplet is the highest quality out of these three i just recommended if you want to stand out a little bit from everyone else then spend a little bit more money and get the la apparel 1801 gd or the as color classic t if you want to get the absolute best blank you can get and money isn't an issue get the rp18x extra note if you're releasing a special t-shirt or a specific graphic that works well on a grey blank then i highly recommend you use that los angeles apparel mt-01 yukon army tee like i said it's unfortunate it only comes in gray heather but if they've released it in extra colors it would be the only shirt i would use you", "qpYGhGNPm7A": "two things that I like I like t-shirts and I like style hacks I'm always looking online to find different little tips and tricks that can help getting dressed easier just help your life in regards to fashion a little bit more simple so one of the tips that I always see online is to make your shirt softer using salt so I was like huh this interests me BASC your t-shirt in salt and then it suddenly comes out softer I'm always buying t-shirts and frankly I like to buy semi expensive t-shirts there are certain lower end brands that work for me but you know I'm a t-shirt junkie I want them soft I want them nice so I thought to myself well if these hacks actually work could I take like a five pack of Target Hanes t-shirts and turn them into an expensive shirt so I could essentially take a $2.00 shirt and turn it into a $100 shirt so I got really excited about it and went to Target about my shirt it's about my salt took a little Bowl and I went to town so this is the new version of the t-shirt from Target PS immense medium a little tiny I would get immense large our boys large excuse me so this is a new one out of the package it feels pretty soft but what I discovered is I think what they're doing is they're putting like some sort of coating on top of the shirt so it feels soft in the package but then once you wash it like the softness washes off so feeling it I'm like well this isn't too bad but don't be fooled so this is the new the star control item okay pretty soft you know looks pretty good so then I found a instructions online on how to make your shirt softer with salt and what they said was to take big pot of water put your t-shirt inside cover it with water add one cup of salt and bring it to a boil okay so bring it to a boil once it hits a boil you put it down to a simmer pop a lid on it and let that baby marinate in that salt water for 45 minutes so I did that watch a little scandal while it was boiling away and then you take it out you put it in the wash and wash it like you would your normal clothes so I had a couple of other things in the laundry use my soap did the whole thing dried it was thinking out crunchy okay this did not work the boiling trick it didn't work this thing feels horrible like it is so far from soft that it's like it's ridiculous and on the site they were saying that they tried it and it worked you know maybe they had a more expensive shirt to start with maybe that's what happened but I do not recommend the boiling technique big ole thumbs down moving right along so then you know this is a five pack I could experiment then I found another recipe that said take bowl of water just regular cold water no boiling required half a cup of salt and soak your t-shirt in it for three days and then wash it as normal so for this one I was like let's just add a little more salt 1/2 a cup didn't seem like enough so I think I added a cup of salt you know I wanted to a speed of the process so I put the shirt in the bowl of salt on a Friday and then Sunday night I took it out instead of washing it in the machine because I thought maybe that would be too harsh I hand washed it with some soap from the laundress and I let it air dry for a bit I tumbled it in the dryer just to soften it up and these are the results now this one feels a heck of a lot better than the boiled shirt like way softer does it feel softer than the the new one not really so the salt trick you know sorry if you got all excited you were like oh cool I'm going to like check out how to do this I just don't know that it works that well I think you should just buy a soft shirt to begin with like I said I hate to burst your bubble but I'm in three days and I wasted like a couple cups of salt I could have cooked with that salt I don't think it's worth it but I will tell you if you do want to try it definitely the three day soaking method Trump's the old boiling method so scrap the boiling so I would love to hear your thoughts if you've tried this and maybe it worked for you maybe I just have no clue how to dip a shirt and salt maybe I just suck at it but if you've done it and it worked please let me know if you've done it and it was horrible - I'd like to hear about that as well so that is how you fail at making sure softer with salt", "uOaAoMvAtSs": "hi I'm Lindsey spore and I'm modeling this next level ombre t-shirt they come in a ton of different colors get yours from loyola calm

i guarantee each of you already own i'm talking more basic than bathroom selfies vineyard vines and yes even more basic than all of them becky's out there in the world and of course we're talking about plain tees now everyone knows how essential plain tees are to every man's wardrobe because of their simplicity and versatility with that being said everyone knows that it's nearly impossible to find the perfect tee but your boy is like mj and i took that statement personally that's why in this video i'll be going over six t-shirts all at different price points in the hopes of finding the best tee now keep in mind that my rankings especially when it comes to fit is based off of my preferences and my body type so make sure to make your own judgments as well i will provide the sizes that i bought as well as my upper body measurements throughout the video so that you can easily compare and make those judgments in terms of my ranking system i will give each tea a score of 1 to 10 that will take into account fit quality and overall value but before i begin if at any point throughout the video you like it or find it to be informative i would really appreciate it if you gave the video a thumbs up so without further ado the first tee that i have here is the everlane air crew tea and i got this one in a size small this tea comes in at a price of 24 which is right in the middle of the pack compared to all the other teas now by just holding this tea i can tell that it's extremely lightweight and a bit on the thinner side now when looking at the fit this shirt actually fits pretty well which honestly is not what i expected the shirt has a nice slim fit through the chest and waist without being overly tight and the arm sleeves are nice and tapered with an overall solid sleeve length it could maybe be a half inch shorter if i wanted the perfect fit but this length is more than satisfactory the only thing i will say is that the collar is a tad wide for me but i also just have a smaller neck at 14.5 inches so that may just be a me problem now judging the quality this tee is made of 100 cotton and is purposely woven loosely in an uneven sub texture for extra breathability while the breathability and lightweight features are a plus i can definitely feel like this can shrink up on you if you don't hang dry the tee so you may just want to be extra careful when washing now maybe i'm just not used to extremely lightweight tees but i feel like i have to be extra gentle when taking this shirt off because when i try to take it off the first time normally i felt like i was almost going to rip the shirt again i'm just not the biggest fan of lightweight tees as one of my basic essentials so i have to mark it down a few points for quality with that being said i'll probably rate this t a 7.5 out of 10 because even though the shirt is lightweight and can tear a little bit easier i feel like the fit is actually really great besides just a slightly loose collar now the second tee that i have is the madewell tri-blend all-day crewneck tee and this shirt comes in at 29.50 this tea has a little bit of a rougher texture on the exterior but we'll see if the interior has a different feel but first when it comes to fit this tee fits extremely well the chest width is basically perfect for my body type and the length is great as well i would say that it runs just slightly on the longer end but definitely isn't major the arm sleeve link sticks right around mid bicep which i do like but the only thing i'll say is that i wish the arm width was just a quarter or half inch smaller to fit nice and snug on my arm now when it comes to the quality this tee is made from a cotton polyester blend so it definitely does have a little bit of stretch to it now while i said earlier that the outer layer texture is a bit rough i didn't find any discomfort when actually wearing the shirt i wouldn't consider the shirt to be extremely soft but it definitely is comfortable enough to wear regularly and then lastly i would consider the shirt to be a medium weight and so it definitely will keep its shape and isn't flimsy and with all that being said i'd give this tea for madewell a solid 8 out of 10. the main reason why i had to mark it down a few points is because i feel like this would be better priced at 20 rather than 30 and so the overall value is a little bit lower and now the next tea that i have for you guys is the men's premium tea from talentless and this tea comes in at 39 right off the bat i can tell that this tea has a premium feel to it because it's much softer than the other two teas now when it comes to the fit though this shirt is not what i expected at all the shirt description stated that it has a relaxed fit and so i'm either extremely chunky or this tee is definitely more of a slim tapered fit i actually do like the width at the hips and waist but the chest area and the armholes especially are definitely a bit too tight for my liking i can definitely feel my arms losing blood circulation because of how tight the t is and so i would say to recommend sizing up but the thing is if you're short a guy like me at five feet six inches the size small i have here is a bit long and i can only imagine how much longer a size medium would be now when assessing the quality it truly does feel extremely premium and has a ridiculously soft feel for a garment dyed cotton fabric the collar is nicely ribbed and so there is a bit of stretch to it making it much easier to put on but then the collar quickly compresses again right after and wraps up tightly around your neck honestly if this shirt just fit me better i'd be going crazy over this tee because of the quality you're getting at this price point however because that isn't the case and fit is extremely important when it comes to basic tees i have to rate this tee a 7 out of 10. now the next tee that i have is the t-shirt from ask it and this is priced at 45. now the great thing about ascot is that they actually offer 15 different sizes from extra small to extra large with length options of short regular and long i chose to go with the size small and the short length because i am on the shorter side but as you will see i wish i had gotten the regular length when looking at the fit this shirt for me almost fits to perfection but the only thing that is stopping it from fitting perfectly is the shirt length i'm going to try and return this for the regular length because everything else truly fits great i love both the chest and arm sleeve widths and the sleeve length is at my preferred length as well hopefully when i return this for the regular length version this tee will fit perfectly when it comes to the quality of the shirt it definitely is more of a premium heavyweight cotton fabric which will definitely make this shirt extremely durable now i will say that the shirt isn't as soft or comfortable as the tailless tee that i just tried on but it has a similar or better feel than all the other tees in this video and then this tea similarly to the talentless tee also has a nice ribbed neckline that really conforms to your neck with now overall with this shirt i'll have to give it an 8.5 out of 10 because of the fit and the premium quality but i hope that when i return this for the size small in the regular length i'll be able to grade it up to a 9 or a 9.5 now the fifth tee that i have here is a uniqlo supima cotton tee and this tee comes in at 14.90 now at 15 bucks this tee has a pretty nice overall fit but i'll judge it objectively like i did with all the other tees the chest measurement of this shirt fits perfectly on my body and the shirt length is also perfect sitting right around mid crotch a few shortcomings of this tea though has to be the slightly looser neckline as well as slightly loose armholes when it comes to the quality the shirt is made with 100 supima cotton and has a nice smooth texture finish i would consider this tee to be a medium weight and that is not nearly as lightweight as the everlane tee but it is definitely lighter than the ascit and talentless tees in terms of comfortability i wouldn't say that it's jaw-dropping comfortable but it definitely still is comfortable enough to wear regularly as an essential piece and with this tee only coming in at 15 i would say that this tee has the best value meaning you get the best bang for your buck however with that being said the t isn't perfect and so i have to rate it a 9 out of 10. now the last that i have is a jersey t-shirt from todd snyder and this one is in a size small this tee comes in at a whopping price of 68 and so we'll see if the fit and quality warrant this higher price looking at the fit i'm a bit torn because there are a few things i love about this tee but then there are also some small deal breakers i love the chest width as it's a comfortable slim fit and i also love the width of the arms however it would be a tiny bit better if it was just a quarter inch looser the neckline is just a bit too loose for my liking and the length of the shirt is also a bit on the longer end now when it comes to the quality that's an entirely different story while i can argue that the ascit or tailless tee has the most premium feel this tee is a very close second but it's by far the softest tee out of all of them they use 100 garment dyed cotton jersey fabric which is the reason why this tee not only has an extremely premium feel but is also super soft and stretchy because of the jersey fabric if this tee had a perfect fit then i would maybe consider it as one of the top tees in this list but because the fit isn't that great and the price is astronomical the overall value of the shirt decreases and i would have to rate it a 6 out of 10. alright so now that we got through all the teas let's see how each tee ranked up against each other now remember that my rankings take into account fit quality and overall value but also keep in mind that something that may not have fit me well may actually fit you great so hopefully you can make that comparison so coming in last place with a score of 6 out of 10 or 60 we have the todd snyder t now if we were using the asian grading scale with these scores then this would be a d and if you're asian you would know that this stands for don't come home if you don't get the joke this basically means that you gotta score so low that your parents don't even think that you deserve to come home but luckily i'm not that ruthless when it comes to grading and i actually think that this can find itself in people's homes because of how soft and high quality the tea is but because the tea just didn't fit my body type well and it's also priced at 68 dollars i had to rank it last on my list now in fifth place we have the men's premium tea from talentless which got a score of 7 out of 10. now i will preface this by saying that if the t did fit me better it would definitely be in the top three but because the t was a bit long and a little too tight for me as well as being the second most expensive option at 39 i had to ring it fifth on my list moving on to fourth place with the score of 7.5 out of 10 we have the everlane air crew tee now the fit of this tee was nearly perfect but because this tee just didn't feel as durable because of the lighter weight this tea isn't one that i would keep now finishing it in the top three is the madewell tri-blend all-day crewneck tea which received a score of 8 out of 10. this tea had a very similar feel and fit to the uniqlo tee but was just double the price which is why i had to rank it third now finishing as a runner up we have the asget t-shirt which received a score of 8.5 out of 10. now while this technically finished second i would consider it more of a 1b because it really depends on whether you prefer quality or affordability the t is quite expensive at 45 but the quality is seriously amazing and the fit is great too again the only issue that i had was the length and that was my fault because i chose to go with the shorter length rather than the regular length but i'm going to exchange it for the regular size small and i'm expecting the fit to be perfect but lastly coming in first place in terms of the best bang for your buck it has to be the uniqlo pima cotton tea the tea is priced at 14.90 but it often goes on sale for 9.90 and the fit and quality are great you really can't find a better fitting tee at this price point and so if you want an affordable yet still very high quality tea then i would definitely recommend to go with the uniqlo supima cotton tea now again those are just my rankings and so i'd love to hear your thoughts and your own rankings based off what you saw in this video let me know down in the comments if you agree or just think that i'm crazy and now that's all that i have for you guys in today's video hopefully this video helped you guys

gonna try to supplement and then bleach and then bleach and then sublimate and see which one gives us the best results so let's jump right into this and get started so here you'll see i already bleached the one on the left and then the one on the right here this is the one that we are going to put our image on and then we are going to bleach it so the bleached image is already bleached washed dried ready to go when you see us press it you're going to see some steam come off of it because it is a little bit wet we are using you know certifical t-shirt making 65 polyester you do need the polyester in order to sublimate or your image is not going to stick even if you bleach cotton it's not going to stick to the fabric super important to get a polyester blend thing over 50 seems to be the best for me now here i marked shirt one and sure just in case the results are so close that i can't tell the difference because my goal is to get them pretty much the same i'm making these for my daughter and her friend and you know sorry you kind of want them to be as close as possible all right so what we're going to do is we are going to make sure that our image is centered so i fold the shirts in half and i'm just going to do like a quick press just to give me a nice straight line and not only am i going to put a straight line down the shirt but i'm also going to fold the end in half and just do a little indents just so i kind of have some sort of a guide you know you always kind of just want to eye it up the best that you can now i use a super small press here so it's very important that i you know line it up because i have such a small space i'm working with um you know i wasn't sure how i was gonna feel about doing the t-shirting so you know i didn't go crazy and buy the most expensive thing on the market um here you're gonna see that we are pressing the bleached first shirt so we're just going to kind of give it a second this is the one that i don't know if you can see in the inch but yep there's a little bit of steam popping out there because the shirt was just a little wet from me hurrying up trying to get it washed and then flamated so here we are we have our image and this image i believe i just purchased it off of etsy i do buy my edges i don't think it's okay to just keep stealing stuff off of google especially if you're gonna use that multiple times or you know commercial images so i do you know get my permissions in order especially if i'm going to put it on youtube so you can go on etsy and find you know bundles of different images sublimations all right so here we go we're going to fold our little picture in half and this is hocus pocus so cute it's a squat on it adorable especially for little girls um all right so here we go we are gonna get our mat nice and clean and solid straight we're gonna put our shirt down again working through a very small press so we have to make sure everything is lined up perfectly and everything is fitting into our little canvas area that we're working with we don't need anything hanging outside be very careful uh i know my hand gets very close to the top part there but you know you you know your limits and what you're capable of handling and the heat that you can handle on your fingers so anyway back to the shirt we're going to line this baby up we're going to make sure that it's where it needs to be now i probably overkill but i do put the tooth down just to help any blowouts and to help contain the gases that's how you sublimate the gases come out and they attach to your fibers you have a beautiful image but um i don't know so i put two top parts on it seems to be the best thing that's worked for me thus far this is just parched paper from my kitchen and then i had these sheets that came with my vinyl once um it worked very well so we're just waiting and this is fast forward so you're not sitting here for 60 seconds waiting for my shirt to press we're gonna release it and you're going to be able to see a little glimpse of the bleached first shirt bring your mark get set go oh man already you can just tell it is beautiful but we're not going to ruin it you're still going to be surprised at the very end when we compare it to our sublimated first then bleached image and tell me whether or not you like it and which one came out better so same thing here what we need to do is fit it all on the mat make sure nothing is hanging over where we need the image to go or obviously it's going to be on the shirt and now this one's going to come out and it's going to be a little scary it's going to be very dark you're not going to really be able to see it but then the bleachers work it's magic and then we will have a gorgeous image so here we are again lining it up making sure that it's even it's on our mats and then now press it [Music] we're going to cover it here with our little protective you know of course it is heat resistant and make sure you're not using wax paper i do need to tell you all that do not use wax paper make sure it is partial paper so okay that 60 seconds was the first to 60 seconds of my life and let's wait here it is ready oh my gosh you can barely see it right like you already saw the bleach one turned out pretty good this one a little bit different story but never fear it's not over yet if you've seen our other videos here you'll know they come out pretty nice when they're all said and done so here you have it here's our second squad one and oh one of them there's the other one but you have seen the side by side yet so don't go anywhere because i'm gonna shift side by side the difference so here we go we take our dark now shirt number two we take it outside and then we're gonna bring her down and i was working on the other shirts too so if you're instead we'll have that video up soon and we're just gonna squirt around our shirt right around the image try not to get the neckline if you get the neckline there is a chance that it will bleed through and it just does not look cute so i use plastic bag good you know use of recycling there use the plastic bags put them between the shirts try to get them if you can see here on the right how it's covering the neckline try to do that be very cautious of drip any little drip is going to show up on your shirt obviously so here i am here just trying to contain it keep it in the center i want to make sure that you know the entire center is covered with bleach and it's not running all over because you don't want to ruin your image and you want to keep that bleach contained so next you're going to rinse it with cold water wash it in the washer dry it in your dryer just like you would your clothes obviously don't put anything in there that you don't want a little bleach on so just wash it by itself you can and here are results the left is the bleach first and the right is seated then bleach which one did you like i'm gonna tell you my winter bleach first and then sublimate my first time do and i think their results were actually a lot better than the vice versa so yeah bleach it first then sublimate and guys don't forget that right button thank you so much for watching we appreciate you as bye y'all", "LT9ov3rzVIc": "your business is booming your bands on tour that family reunion you really don't want to go to its coming up you're gonna start a clothing line with your tax returns you need shirts you're filling out the order form on the website of some sweet merch company upstate merch they're asking what shirt brand and style you want you check the list Bella canvas Jersey all style Gildan American Apparel Hanes an Vil champion Toltecs Fruit of the Loom they're just t-shirts man what's the difference in this message from upstate merch we're talking about the most common shirts we sell and the differences between them [Music] so I've divided this into three tiers one your basic economy shirts two your mid-level premium shirts three your high-end tri blends basic economy shirts I'm 6 foot tall 185 pounds and I wear a large of the basic shirts we sell all the brands and styles are pretty much the same standard fitting true to size and about the same 5 ounce cotton weight getting one instead of the other because you're looking for better quality is like going to Burger King instead of McDonald's it's a little different you might have a preference but it's kind of the same thing how dare you don't listen to a Big Mac baby flame-broiled Maia for basic 100% cotton shirts we mostly sell the Gildan 5000 some substitutes include the Hanes 50 to 80 and the jerseys three six three four basic blends we mostly sell the Gildan 8000 for a substitute the jerseys 29 m or the Hanes 51 70 blends are usually a 50/50 mixture of polyester and cotton make my own blend a little bit of cotton a little bit of poly and so you might be asking what's the difference between a basic blend and a basic cotton tee cotton has more breathability and comfort but it's more likely to lose shape and color with repeat washings the polyester and blends makes them stronger hold shape and better for athletic activities all of these shirts have preshrunk cotton but if you don't follow your care instructions and just cram it into the dryer which is what most people do they're going to shrink I ain't wash my clothes anyhow and I ain't got a wife that does it for me either if you're worried about shrinking your best bet would be to get a blend a lot of times people are afraid to get basic shirts they call them cardboard shirts got this for cheap scratchy and starchy not wrong with a little starch they aren't that bad by any means they have a purpose they're budget-friendly shirts good for work and giveaways if they get ruined it doesn't hit your wallet as hard they're also better if you prefer a loose-fitting shirt or if you have a larger build maybe you're a big dude you even lift bro and you don't want some fancy fitted shirt with soft cotton maybe you want to roll your cigs up in that unfitted sleeve and listen to the boss Tipton worth mentioning some of the brands offer even thicker versions of their 100% cotton tees like the Gildan 2000 or the Hanes 50 180 beefy t be fair these are gonna be a bit tougher and I recommend them alongside the blends for contractors but keep in mind it's still a shirt sometimes we feel like customers are looking for a magical shirt that's flame resistant stain resistant stab resistant unfortunately the quest for the magical unicorn shirts have a field of course because they do not exist there's no shame in getting the basic shirts the best way to describe them is they're just regular shirts I recommend considering the basic shirts just think about your needs and they might be the right pick mid-level premium shirts I still wear a large you'll see the words combed ring-spun cotton which is a manufacturing process that makes them thinner softer and stronger usually these are fitted to these are the shirts people would generally rather wear because they're more comfortable than the basic shirts being fitted they also look more flattering for a lot of people and they're a little bit more trendy trendy they will last longer they will make you look good for 100% cotton we mostly sell the next level 3600 and for a substitute we usually sell the Bella 3000 and one for a blend we mostly sell the next level 6,200 and for a substitute the Bella 3650 these shirts cost more but you can generally get into this style for about 80 cents to a dollar more than a basic tee that's less than extra cheese on your pizza extra cheese is two dollars again I recommend trying them out to see if the right for you [Music] talk to your tribe lense Oh what the hell's he talking about blend I still wear a large as the name implies it's a blend of three materials generally cotton polyester and rayon making them the thinnest and the softest they're fitted like the mid-level premium shirts except the rayon gives them a unique drape does the carpet match the drapes tri blends usually don't come in solid colors I'm not gonna say they never do instead they usually come in Heather colors Heather's a girlfriend once I think her name was Heather here you can see the difference between a solid black and a tri-blend black these shirts are very fashion-forward trendy we mostly see them used for clothing lines small or personal runs of tees athletic based companies businesses that aren't contractor based but even contractors might throw in a couple of these as nicer shirts to wear when they're not working the brand we sell the most the next level 6010 for a substitute the belle of 3413 see starting at two dollars and sixty five cents more than a basic shirt you generally don't want to ruin these as work shirts or use them as a giveaway 265 more tell me how to spend my money I'll make it rain crap that was a tenner again I recommend trying them out to see if they're right for you you can always get a mix of shirt styles in one order they don't all have to be the same style or brand also you can order blank samples before you place a print order these are shirts that I wanted to bring up because I want you to know about them but they don't really fit in the other tiers I'll call them hybrids not talking about no Toyota Prius first up is the Gildan h zero zero zero hammer shirt this is a regular fitted shirt manufactured like a premium shirt it's thick combed ring spun cotton so it's a soft strong shirt that's standard cut and true to size instead of being fitted next up is the jersey 601 mr tri-blend it's standard fit true to size but it's a try blend lastly 100% polyester shirts they are often billed as dry fit ClimaCool cool dry dry power dry Sport active and performance shirts they have wicking properties which are essentially Littlejohn wicks that fight off moisture by absorbing it and drawing it away from your body of course really good for athletics in the sports ball go to the shirt I recommend most is the a four and 3142 let's do a quick review the cheapest option the 100% cotton standard cut Gildan 5000 worried about shrinking need something a little stronger try a blend the Gildan 8,000 take it up a notch with a premium fitted cotton tee like the next level 3600 need a blend try the next level 6200 if you want the feel and breathability of cotton the strength and wicking properties of polyester the special drape and comfort of rayon the thinnest and softest shirt tri next level 60 10 tri-blend so there you have it upstate merch is most sold types of t-shirts and brands there are tons of other brands and options there are also other types of apparel that exists in those same

get hot in here because we're talking about heat transfer vinyl and what shirts work best for it up next hey guys it's Melissa with shirt space and today I'm bringing up the hot talk okay enough of the cheesiness so let's jump right in to pick the best shirt for heat transfer vinyl the shirt has to meet a certain criteria it will not only need to be a great T to wear but it will also need to be a tea that works well with your heat transfers heat transfer vinyl works well with many fabrics but we think these two type of fabrics stand out above the rest the first is a hundred percent polyester polyester is less likely to shrink than any other fabrics but what does this have to do with heat transfer vinyl once your design has been added to the tea it's crucial that it does not shrink this could wrinkle pull or even ruin the vinyl with 100% polyester you know your shrinkage will be minimal and we like minimal shrinkage especially when it comes to HTV but I'm not just gonna stop there what if we could take it to another level well there's no what-ifs about it we can with three simple words cotton poly blend cotton poly blends are the best of both worlds you have the durability and minimal shrinkage from the polyester and the softness and wearability of the cotton the blending of these two fabrics will create an overall makeup that you will love since this is our number one candidate what's the top tea we recommend in this category drumroll please it's the bell of canvas 3001 CVC made up a 52% heirloom combed and ring spun cotton which is the best cotton out there and 48 percent polyester weighing in at 4.2 ounces this is a lightweight tea that you will love to wear being a retail fit and fashion-forward your customers can rock your great design it has unisex sizing

onto a t-shirt when she lifts the press up she notices that it's all gunky and gluey and sticky and the designs not smashed into the t-shirt it's pretty much sliding around and it's just a big mess from the pictures that she's shown me I asked her what kind of vinyl was she using and she replied with she was just using the vinyl that came with her vinyl cutter I think she has a cricket or cameo not exactly sure but I think she bought one of those like budget bundle deals where she buys the cutter and it comes with like a few you know twelve by twelve pieces of vinyl to practice on and test out so I think she had one of those but she thought she had heat transfer vinyl but the vinyl that was supplied was regular decal vinyl now you're asking yourself what's the difference between heat transfer vinyl and decal vinyl basically heat transfer vinyl is made to be heat transfer it onto a garment onto a t-shirt onto a hat onto whatever type of material you bought the vinyl for now let me stop right there and just say that when you're buying heat transfer vinyl you have to buy the vinyl made for the material that you're gonna be pressing on meaning if you're gonna be pressing on polyester make sure that the vinyl you buy can adhere to polyester a lot of times we'll buy some vinyl because it'll be on sale or we might not be looking at the label and it might be made for like nylon and then we go and try to press it onto a cotton t-shirt and it doesn't adhere right the settings are all backwards and messed up and we don't understand what's going on the problem is each vinyl is made for certain materials so you might get some heat transfer vinyl that's made for cotton for polyester and cotton poly blends so that's just saying that heat transfer vinyl will work on 100% cotton 100% polyester and a blend in between the two now why is this important because it's not going to adhere correctly to whatever material you're using if have a heat transfer vinyl that's made for like I said nylon and you're trying to put it onto cotton or vice versa so you have some heat transfer vinyl that's made for cotton now you're trying to put it onto some nylon bags and nylon jackets and you're melting your bags and jackets and you don't understand what's going on you have to buy the vinyl made for the materi you're gonna press on with that being said decal vinyl is the vinyl that you make stickers and car decals and like that for hydro flash car windows I mean you can stick them on anywhere but that's the regular basic decal vinyl that's not made to be heat press and it's not made for t-shirts now if you are buying vinyl by the rule on the shelf this might look normal and like oh yeah let me just get that put that on t-shirt but no this is actually decal I know it's a little bit more glossy you'll notice that there's some holes right there let's see if we get this in focus so there's holes on the side usually that tells you that this is decal vinyl you could tell by the feel it's pretty glossy most of the time heat transfer vinyls a little bit more matted and dull in color this is usually on a really big role when I go to mclogan right here in LA this is on a really big roll and I tell them let me get you know 5 yards of this 3 yards of this and they pull it out cut it and give it to me this is a 15 inch roll this is probably maybe two yards of orange this right here looks the same it's rolled up vinyl but this is actually heat transfer mine on the shelf it probably doesn't look just like this it comes in a C it'll come in like a bag similar to this there'll be some heating instructions a piece of paper in here it'll say you know what material it's made for the brand name how to apply it the instructions all of that will be on a piece of paper inside this plastic tube this is your standard 5 yard if 10 inch roll and this is heat transfer vine this right here made to put on two garments so these are made for cotton and poly blends there's no holes on the side like the other one that I just showed you color is a little bit more magic because this is the side that's gonna get stuck on to the t-shirt they look very similar like if you're buying them on Amazon you wouldn't know the difference most of the time heat transfer vinyl comes with application instructions the regular decal vinyl sometimes does sometimes doesn't but yeah that's pretty much it so hopefully if you were having that same issue and you watch my video and you see me cut some vinyl out and press it on a t-shirt you notice that the decal vinyl is not sticking on the shirt and it's kind of gumming the shirt up and you see the glue getting everywhere and like that it's a big mess that's because you're using the wrong final possibly you might be using decal vinyl when you should be using heat transfer vinyl HT v heat transfer vinyl it's usually referred to both of these on - when you see it if you wanted to buy some make sure you check the

cotton vintage wash t-shirt. Now this is one of my favorite t-shirts personally for a few reasons. One it is so soft and also it's so thin now\nyou can often have like kind of a soft shirt but the thinness of this fabric, it's about a 3.7 ounce fabric, 100% ring-spun cotton so it just feels so airy, so light. When you're wearing it, it just flows, which is awesome. It also has been garment washed so it has a kind of a more, I guess organic or\nvintage-y feel to it. It doesn't have that bright pop of a color, it has a more muted feel. Great fit, great fabric. Instead of just telling you though, we do have one of our models here coming over to show it off. Now, first thing you're gonna notice, is a great fit. You can see the side seam is just naturally gonna hug your sides. It's not gonna be big and boxy. The next thing though, is all about the neckline on this shirt. A much thinner collar. So this is a, I'd say, more trendy shirt. You're talking about a really thin fabric, a cool more vintage-y, earthy, color because of that wash applied to it, and then this collar being a little thinner makes this look like a\nlittle more expensive of a shirt. The price point is awesome on this. It's gonna be a little more expensive than the hundred percent ring-spun, but worth every penny. The sleeve right here comes to mid-bicep again, a great sleeve length, not baggy. That's the big thing about district threads, a lot of the upper echelon brands, American Apparel, Alternative, we don't want baggy and this is not baggy. If we're going to put this kind of in a category though, its gonna be between a hundred percent ring-spun cotton, and kind of a 50/50 or 60/40 in terms of softness. It is a hundred percent ring-spun cotton, so over the\ncourse of a lot of washes, it could start pilling, it might offer a little\nshrinking if you dry your clothes on super high. But if you're thinking about what size should I order? It is very true to size and we do offer size charts on our site you can look at. Now this is a great shirt all around but since it is kind of that more muted and washed color we would recommend keeping the print super simple we love vintage ink on a soft shirt like this. Vintage ink meaning a softer coat of ink. It's a thinner, thinner coat of ink that allows some of the shirt color to come through, which is just amazing because this shirt doesn't need to have a ton of ink coverage. This shirt says a lot let the ink kind of just compliment it. That vintage white on it or a thin coat of navy or black or whatever complimenting color is perfect. If you wanted a bright white, we always offer standard ink also, or a bright yellow or whatever. But the vintage is amazing on this shirt. Tyler you look awesome in it, thank you so much. On the Coed Monkey Soft Scale we rate this t-shirt a two. Thanks for watching this video please let us know if you have any questions because here at Coed Monkey, Soft Matters, and so do our customers.", "pT-l_XSqq18": "especially returning these these don't buy the Hutton these t-shirts are hot garments like don't even buy those YouTube what is going on in Detroit GZ in AEG bean Kesey and in today's video we're gonna be trying on all of these t-shirts all these white tees that are either from H&M Zara in your knee glow and we're trying to find out which one is the best white t-shirt for your essential wardrobe rotation going through different fabrics price and also the fitting so let's go ahead and talk about it before watching this video is that in my personal opinion there really is no such thing as a perfect white t-shirt that can last you for decades not really anyway or not not necessarily one brand name that I have gone to because if there was I would have found it by now and a big reason behind making this video is that a lot of people are curious as far as what the differences are between these white shirts compared to another brand just putting that out there so anyways let's go ahead and do this just a zoom out here real quick okay so the way we're gonna format this I'm just gonna go shirt by shirt try them on and we're gonna go through some categories like fit price comfort ability and also things like fabric if I leave out any of those details in a particular t-shirt we could talk about it in the comment section below okay first up we got these through neck dry color t-shirts by you to blow and I bought a large and I bought an extra-large I've never tried them on as full crew I've never even seen this actually this is kind of like in their pajama section seven dollars and ninety cents almost ten bucks per shirt maybe there's two of them in here I don't know what about to find I was going to open this up I'm hoping that these are returnable though got it fabric is not bad it's kind of soft not bad it does look a little bit see-through mind go ahead and try this one on first this is a size large by the way alright for the sake of this video I'm taking my chain off it's a little too thin for me it definitely feels way more of a kind of feels like a pajama like I just kind of mentioned if I'm looking in the mirror biggest drawback to this is that you can actually see my wife beater underneath like look how see-through that it's like I bet you if I didn't have this wife beater on could totally seen it would I absolutely hate what teachers do that like it sucks it looks really stupid I look stupid you look sooo the Libyan rebels you already know what it is let's just try on the extra large for kicks and giggles anyway but we already know that this t-shirt is just not it okay this one's looking a little more promising as I'm trying it on as far as size goes I mean extra large honestly fits like a large I'm a my true to size is a large I bet you through the camera you can see my pants can you see my pants like if you can see your pants through the t-shirt or through the t-shirt no this it's an automatic no like I just like nipples and pants you can see my nipples and you can see my boxers and pants through your t-shirt then you shouldn't even be wearing a t-shirt doesn't even make sense I would say for sure these are more of like a pajama and I don't even know for sure if they are for pajamas or not the only Plus that I would say to this t-shirt that I do like is that this collar is actually kind of tight the neck area actually stays the same size as the size large which I like because if I end up sizing up maybe to a double X which I don't even think they have double exit you know go for this t-shirt and I was looking at the top and there was just only XL ring of the next day is the same size which is good because if you end up getting two sizes up are size up the the ring of the next not gonna get like you know two inches bigger an inch bigger kind of suck sometimes good then you can see your collarbone I mean that's great but that is enough for me to keep this t-shirt where you can see nips wife-beater boxers and pants no go I'm gonna put this one to the side for now okay so this is the super thin Yuna globe t-shirt you see my hand like you can you can see my hand right okay so then now we're gonna put the thicker one on here hold on now can you see my hand it's way harder so like clearly this one is like way thicker so just the thin t-shirts like just stay away from these these suck okay next brand we got up is we're gonna talk about Zara and we bought one t-shirt out of this whole stack of t-shirts that is from Zara and this is actually a shirt that I'm very familiar with so let's go ahead and try it on first still got the tag on I'm already I'm keepin the shirt I already know I am because I own I own a couple of these and reason why I absolutely love these shirts is because they're not seeing through very different than what we just tried on this one you can't see through it and if you can't comment and let me know that you can see this I mean as far as I know you can't see my wife later you probably can't see my pants either also I like the fit too it's not like boxy not like crazy boxy words like too high here this is a size large but it does fit between like large and XL if that if that's not even like really a size but if I were to just like give you a gauge of what it kind of fits like and I love that I love that it comes down to here cuz it covers up my farmers can just keep it in one it doesn't rise that's too high doesn't rise down too low not trying to be like too trendy I love it the fabric is also very soft these do come in at a whopping $20 and also a very quick tip for this t-shirt from Zara is that they make them usually in like three colors black white I think like a beige color and I think that's it but as far as I know right now these are kind of like year-round because when I first started buying these shirts ending 2017 beginning 2018 I started buying these shirts from Zara and these are not like the cheap shirts because they make like three or four different batches of different types of white t-shirts they have ones that are super see-through they suck they have like elongated ones I pass on those samples with zippers I also pass on those but this is just like your regular mundane white t-shirt but it's like a little bit of fabric softening is actually very nice too for some people you might even eat the size down but for me I just go true to size I go with a large it works for me and also best thing about it is if you wash it and dry it it doesn't wrinkle as much especially for being you know it being a cheaper t-shirt $20 t-shirt it is what it is I love it let's go ahead and move on to the next shirt okay next shirt we got up is another unit load shirt I literally bought these without without even looking at them and I didn't know it came with a pocket tried my best not to buy t-shirts for this video with pockets but you know we're already here at this point we already have both of the t-shirts in a size large and also an XL let me try on the size large first size large it does look a little oversized already kind of even bigger than the shirt that I have on and also it looks a little bit more boxy but let's go ahead and try it on and see how this goes and wow this is very this is like pretty oversized hold on it's all it's oversized I'm very boxy actually well I'm not bad I'm kind of impressed to be honest it's not a bad shirt this is a little longer than what we just tried on but it's actually not really like technically boxy because it has this little I don't know what you call this it has like a break here and then it comes down lower in the back but which is which is kind of cool if you're looking for a boxy t-shirt and if you're at Uniqlo I would try these out in addition to that I would say the fabric is pretty nice the fabric is a little thinner than these are t-shirt that I just tried on I don't know how these will hold up in the wash way better than the like pajama type t-shirt and I don't know if you can see can you see my wife beater through it if I do this and you can see the wife beater then it's bad if I do that obviously because you know you see the crease there but if you can see right through it I'm assuming you can't because the fabric is like a little bit thicker I guess right not bad I would say the only thing pushing me away from buying this is this whole little trendy thing I've kind of stayed away from buying t-shirts that do this like little breakage here because I'm really just not into it anymore it just kind of reminds me of going to Zara and then paying for those are teas that have like zippers and weird cuts and kind of like dated back like four or five years I just try to stay away from those and just try to get like regular t-shirts also if you like cigarette holder pocket King that's also a cool thing too I also stay away from t-shirts that have these pockets I don't know why I don't I don't use the pocket much I don't smoke cigarettes I don't have anything light enough to put in my pocket if that makes sense okay we can go ahead and try on the extra-large anyway even though the large fits we can go ahead and try on the extra-large just to show you the size difference seeing that this is an extra-large I'm already we already know this is gonna be huge but anyways this is yeah it's just it's a little too boxy for me the large fit extra-large probably pass on it let's go ahead and move on to the next shirt okay next t-shirt up is from H&M not much to say about it other than the fact that I just I literally walked right eighty-thousand where's the white t-shirts found it purchased it and I just kind of held it up against my body the launch looked too small I only grabbed an extra large so I don't have large and extra-large to compare today so let's go ahead and try this on and then see the difference so as we know when it comes to like the tiers of fast fashion you talked about hmm chuckles ara you know globe whatever other fast fashion houses there are out there those are like the top three in tears it's like you know close at the top bars in the middle and sometimes they battle between top and middle and then H&M is pretty much the bottom of the barrel when it comes to that depending on the item of course all of you eyes I would say this is way thinner this fits and feels exactly like you know Glo JAMA t-shirt that is super thin it literally feels like it's from the same exact Factory my guess is that if I end up washing this and drying it it's it's like toast like literally it is probably a t-shirt that you can only wear once and then once you dry it comes out of the dryer it's like all crinkled and then on top of all of that hmm ste shirt is see-through you can totally see through it if I didn't have my wife beater on you would see nibbles and I'm telling you right now nobody on my channel would want to see that it is but if you really are I guess Ram conscious or a brand loyal to H&M and if you really want to get these shirts I would say size up this extra-large definitely feels like a large to me doesn't really feel like an XL this feels like more of like a pajama t-shirt not even for sports more pajamas a shirt that you just don't care about next shirt okay so the next and final shirt that we have up here is again from Uniqlo we're going back to Uniqlo really quick I've really wanted to talk about these because these have kind of been in conversation with a couple other channels and then also some of my friends have been wearing these as well and they've been recommending this t-shirt to me these are a little bit thicker than the previous Uniqlo t-shirts that we're talking about here today but they're a different fabric they are called crewneck short sleeve t-shirt I mean I hate when they can you give it a different name let's let's just try it on entertain myself a little bit here I'm gonna try the XL on before I try the large on even though I've never tried XL on before so the XL is actually not that bad sizing wise can't see through it right well I can't anyway it's a little too thick for you to see through this is definitely gonna be a lot warmer of a t-shirt compared to the others I would definitely not name this as a pajama t-shirt a lot thicker than actually a majority of the t-shirts that we try on here today but the only difference between this and the others are a t-shirt and you know glow like trendy fitting shirt which I will maybe give the name here is that the fabric on this is a little bit rougher on the skin it's definitely not like a soft fabric this kind of feels like like recycled fabric if like against your skin it does anyway and then also it doesn't like when you do this I know this is like a straight really strange example but when the fabric kind of rubs against your pants and also either a wife-beater underneath and stuff it just it feels like a fabric is gripping on to whatever other fabric it's touching I still prefer the Zara t-shirt over this one as far as fabric goes and also fit even though this is an extra large not really too bad of a fit I would say but let's go ahead and try all the large this is the XL let's see what the large fits like okay this is a lot smaller okay the large large works I think I think large is what do you guys think it's hard to maybe harder to tell on camera but I guess if you want the oversize fit then go for the XL or go for the size up these fit pretty true to size like this is a very true to size large I would say it definitely has a different feel since it does feel a little bit smaller than the extra-large the same specs as this this is just a large compared to an XL it kind of works out it's not bad whether or not I'll keep this one hard to say I have to I have to sleep on this one I don't know it's not it's definitely not perfect the fit is nice the collar is nice you definitely get a thicker color on these on these you do glow ones and you kind of get like this human-made looking collar the collar is a little bit tighter than the Zara one that I like so much out of this bunch but as far as like fabric goes I don't really like this fabric that much I do like the Zara one a little better because it's a lot softer than this one in particular [Music] it's my shirt here real quick yeah just have to kind of summarize this whole thing and I've been wanting to make a video like this for a long time and making a video like this just before we talk about the rest of this here is very difficult because there's too many variations when it comes to white t-shirt and also there is a lack of affordable essential t-shirts that are good geordie I would say 90% 99% besides the one percent that I want to talk about here today I actually like and I will actually keep I'm literally only going to keep one of these t-shirts and it's actually originally the t-shirt that I liked to begin with the Uniqlo one's fabric really isn't soft enough compared to the Zara t-shirt and also the Uniqlo t-shirt that had the better fabric ended up having like that really weird cut on the side of the t-shirt I'm not really a big fan of that those those type of teachers to me just feel a little bit too trendy and I'd like my t-shirts to just be regular mundane shirt instead of like some like fad fit if that's like the right words for it out of the bunch the best one is the Zara t-shirt I don't always shop as ara I know I've made a couple videos either about Zara I do talk about Zara some of my flannels suffer from Zara but you know Zara has a good like 3% of their products that I like okay the rest of them are a little bit too trendy for me and usually the quality is checked a little bit too low but as far as the Zara teacher goes compared to the rest of them I would say the thick is true to size and also the fabric is soft enough I know for a fact that these kind of last through the storm of washing them over and over and over and over and them also keeping the same shape and not wrinkling so much because of whatever particular fabric this is I think in total today I spent like how much should I spend I probably spent like over 100 it's like 120 if you're wondering yes I'm returning stuff especially returning these these don't buy these don't buy these you see these crewneck dry dry color teeth don't buy these these are these are these are pretty bad trends trash if you want to show nipples in your t-shirt and you want to show your belt while wearing the t-shirt at the same time then go ahead and buy these but if not then t-shirts are hot garbage like well don't even buy those so with all that was said today make sure you guys are girls keep the lock right here for our latest information from clothing music to culture it is your boy and I'll see you next time peace Stosh it minute yeah wait a minute we don't say whatever happened to coming into Thomas baby whatever color whatever happen to come into Dolman that's all I want to know me", "fJH4ulFOIoc": "- Hello and welcome. This is Angie with\nthecountrychiccottage.net. Today, we're gonna talk about\nsublimation on a cotton shirt. So if you can believe it or not, this is a cotton T-shirt and I actually sublimated this design. So what is the trick to\ngetting sublimation on cotton? 'Cause you've probably always heard that sublimation can only be on polyester. That's kind of true. Sublimation can be on\nany polyester surface and it just so happens that\nboth glitter heat transfer vinyl and there's even a polyester\nflocked heat transfer vinyl, your sublimation will actually\nreact with those products. I'm giving two products a try today. The first is a glitter\nheat transfer vinyl, and I'm gonna link to all the\nproducts in the description below, so you can find those easily. So this is from B-Flex, and\nmost glitter HTVs will work. You do wanna make sure like they have some polyester content. And then they also have a\nflocked heat transfer vinyl. If you don't know what a flocked is, it's kind of fuzzy, and it's actually polyester, it's intended to be used\nwith a sublimation printer. So you can actually print directly on this if you have a sublimation printer and add it to your cotton designs. But we you are going to not use a sublimation printer because I know a lot of you don't have one. We're actually gonna\nuse sublimation markers. So I'm gonna use this Artesprix brand, this same technique will work\nwith any sublimation product. If you have a sublimation\nprinter, it'll work with that, it'll work with any sublimation ink like sublimation markers, it'll also work with infusible ink and\ninfusible ink sheets. So the same method on the\nflocked heat transfer vinyl, as well as the glitter\nwill work for both these. So this is the glitter that\nI'm wearing and then this shirt is actually made with the flocked. So I'm gonna show you how\nto make this cool watercolor effect on the design, just as an example, but you can definitely use this\nsame method for any designs. You could draw with the pens\nand your Cricut machine. You could cut something out\nwith like the infusible ink sheets and then add it on top\nof the glitter or flocked HCV. So let's take a look at the\nsupplies you'll need and then make our project. The supplies we're gonna\nuse are as follows, so I'm gonna use some Artesprix\nthermal transfer markers. So these are sublimation markers. Then we're gonna need\nsome protective paper, some heat resistant tape,\nand then you'll need some regular copy paper. Now the copy paper will need to be rated for use in a laser\nprinter or copy machine. Just check the back of the package to make sure it's rated to that. And then you'll need a plastic bag. So literally plastic bag\nout of your kitchen cabinet, I recommend a disposable brush\nbecause you can't really, I don't feel like you can\nget the ink out of it. So I always use a disposable\none and then just a little plastic cup or some water, and then some T-shirts. And we are gonna give this a try with two different products. This one is the glitter HTV. So it's a white glitter HTV. And this one is a flocked HTV. It's a polyester flocked HTV. So this particular flock, you don't have to mirror\nit when you cut it. And we'll talk about that in a minute, but if you have like a\nreally intricate design, you may want in some transfer tape to transfer it to your shirt, the transfer tape will need to\nbe something that's rated for heat transfer vinyl. I may or may not use transfer\ntape depending on how my design looks once I cut it. But if you're using a different flock one that's not meant to be printed on. You will wanna make sure\nit's a polyester flock so that your sublimation\nwill actually go into and have that chemical\nreaction with the product and be permanent. So be sure it's a polyester flock. Let's get started first by\ntaking a look at the sublimation markers and how we're gonna\nuse them in this case. All right, so I have my copy paper, and what I'm gonna do\nis pick three colors, completely up to you\nhow many colors you pick and what colors. So I'm gonna go from\npurple to a dark blue, to a light blue. And what I'm gonna do is\nactually write with these on this plastic bag. So I'm gonna write with\nthe purple up at the top, and then I'm going to\nwrite with the darker blue somewhere over here to the side, and then I'm gonna put\nsome of the lighter blue over here on this side. Now what we're gonna do\nis add some water to this. So this is just a cup with\njust a little bit of water and our disposable brush. And we're just gonna\nstart with this purple and add in a few drops of water. Basically, we're making\nour own water color, but with sublimation ink. So now that I have that good and watery, I'm just gonna take some of that and I'm gonna put it on\nthis laser copy paper. So I'm gonna go all the way across this with my watercolor design, because I know that my\ndesign is long and skinny. If your design is small, you can just do a small area or you could do the whole piece of paper. Next, we're gonna do this blue. And what we're gonna do right here on the, the plastic bag is drag some\nof the blue to the center here and drag some of this purple\nand mix those together and create a completely different color and add that right under the first. Then I'll grab some of the blue, add that, and we will do this\nlightest blue and add that. Again, you can do this\nhowever you would like. There are no rules to this at all. And you can even go back\nand add some more color if you wanted to at this stage. So let's more purple to that, just completely up to you. How you want yours to look. Then we want to set this aside and allow it to dry completely. So it's really, really wet. I'm gonna allow that to dry completely. Now I have a few that\nI've already completed and allowed to dry. And here's my two designs. As you can see, like they're kind of\ndifferent, kind of the same, and we're gonna use\nthese and cut the design on our Cricut out of\nthese pieces of paper. So let's take a look at the design itself, cut our paper that now has all\nsublimation ink right on it. And we're gonna cut our glitter\nas well as our flocked HTV. So here we have our Cricut\nmat and we wanna place, this is the glitter and\nthe glitter goes face down on the mat or shiny side down. And then I've set my dial, I'm using the Cricut Explore Air two. This will cut with any Cricut machine, but I set my dial to custom and I picked glitter iron-on from the material list. And I'm also going to pick more pressure, just to\nmake sure that it cuts all the way through. And then I also mirrored my design. So anytime your material\nis face down on the mat, you want to mirror the design itself. So now we can cut the\nglitter HTV with our Cricut. (machine cutting) So once the cut's done, we can eject it from our Cricut, and then we can remove\nthis one from the mat. Now, we will want to also cut\nthe paper that we added the sublimation ink to. And we wanna cut that mirrored as well. So what I did is I took the paper and I used a pair of\nscissors to cut fairly close to where I had painted my design. And I want to put that at\nthe top of my Cricut mat. And now we can cut the same design we just cut from the glitter, we'll want to cut from\nthis piece of paper, using the Cricut. This time however, I'm gonna set my dial to the paper setting, and then we can cut our design. (machine cutting) Once that's done cutting\nI will eject it as well. Now let's take a look at the\nweeding of these designs. So now for the weeding. So for the glitter, I just cut off the excess\nlike with a pair of scissors so I can use it for another project. And then we just peel back all the excess. So we want everything around the outside as well as in this case, I\nwant this center home piece to come out and I'm just\ngonna carefully remove that. So what I would like to do\nis actually use the home for another quick test or project. And I also want to leave, in this case, the centers of these letters and just remove the word itself. So I'm gonna just gonna\nkind of carefully do that, leaving the centers of\nthose letters in place. So I'm gonna do that for the entire word. And then we'll talk about\nweeding the copy paper with that sublimation ink on it. All right, so there's that\npiece completely weeded. So now let's talk about this copy paper. So we're basically\ngonna do the same thing. In this case, I can probably just lift up the Tennessee itself maybe. If you have problems with curling, what you want to do is flip your mat over, and remove the mat from the material and not the material from the mat. And we'll also wanna get out the centers of these letters. So I'm gonna pull off\nthis large piece first. In this case, it'll be two large pieces. Then we'll grab the\ncenters of those letters. Like I said, I kind of have a plan I wanna try to use the word\nhome for another project. We'll see if that works. So I'm just kind of\nbeing gentle just in case I can get it to work. And what I like to do is kind\nof put those pieces right here, so I don't lose them. So I'm gonna be working\non some other stuff and I can just put them\nright there on my mat. And I know that they're\nnot going anywhere. All right, so I've got the centers I need, the two large pieces I\nneed, and the glitter. So let's talk about the\nflocked version of this design. So first things, first, the flocked itself I needed to cut on the green mat. The blue mat was simply not strong enough. I cut it on like a fairly new green mat, a purple mat would probably\nactually work as well. So you need a little bit of a\nstronger grip for the flocked. And then the second thing\nI'm gonna talk about is the fact that there is\nright now as of this airing, I did not see any flocked\nheat transfer vinyl setting on the Cricut. So I tried the glitter. So I did the glitter iron-on\nsetting, more pressure, and we are gonna see how well that worked. So this one we're gonna leave that, there's like a backing paper. Again, we did not mirror the flocked, and you will see why in a few minutes. And the cuts actually look pretty good. So I'm just gonna kinda\npeel everything back. And the T is separate from\nthe rest of the words. So we're gonna peel it from this side. 'Cause this one says Tennessee, while the other one said home. And again, I'm leaving the\ncenters of those letters and this is fairly\ndetailed, so I may go ahead and show how to use transfer tape. Again, if you have a simple design, you could just peel it from this paper. So there's our Tennessee, worked great with the settings that I used. And then we can just weed\nthe paper in the same manner as we did the paper for the home. Again, this one is mirrored. So you wanna mirror for the flocked, don't mirror the design itself, but mirror the sublimation drawing, and you will see why when we press, but that's gonna be\nimportant to get it right, is to not mirror the flocked. And again, it has to be a polyester flock. So don't mirror that. If you purchase the same\nbrand that I'm using and then mirror the actual\npaper that you added that sublimation ink too. So there's that. So I have everything I need on this mat and I'm gonna leave it there. These pieces are super, super small, so I don't wanna move those. So I'm gonna leave that\nand I'm gonna go ahead and get out my easy press and get set up to press these. All right, the B-Flex glitter presses at 295 for 10 seconds. And I have my largest easy press so I can cover this large\ndesign in one press. Now I'm going to first just\nkind of heat up the surface a little bit, getting your\nwrinkles and moisture out, and then what I'm gonna do, I know that I'm gonna be\nsublimating on this in a minute, so I'm actually on top of\nmy largest easy press mat, but I'm gonna stick a\nsmaller, easy press mat, the medium size one inside the shirt. And then I'm gonna use some\nprotective paper to cover that mat up. I wanna make sure that\nit's completely covered where my design is going to go. Just so I don't get anything on my mat and nothing on the back of the shirt. That's just for sublimation. If you were just using\nthe glitter by itself, you would not have to do that. All right, so now the shirt's cool, we're ready to press. We're gonna locate the\ndesign on the shirt. All right, and the carrier\nsheet's already on this, we just need to press, so we'll go ahead and put that down, press with medium pressure\nfor the 10 seconds. And then when the time's up, just remove our press. And we can actually start kind\nof peeling this right away. Just be careful that it's not so hot it's gonna burn your fingers and everything looks really good. We'll just make sure that E stays, okay. So now that design is on our shirt. Now we wanna make sure that's cool. It's already pretty cool, before we put the sublimation on. So as soon as the sublimation\nhits anything hot, it will start to transfer. We can go ahead and set the easy press. So we wanna set it at 360, and we are gonna set it for 100 seconds. Let's do 120. So it says 90 to 180. So I'm gonna do 120. So this is heating up. Our home is cold. So now we can locate our design. And to do that we're gonna\nuse heat resistant tape. So don't use any type, you wanna make sure it's heat resistant. Then we can start taking those pieces that we weeded earlier, placing them on top of this glitter and taping them into place. Now, remember, these are\nthat laser copy paper that we did the watercolor effect on. So they have that sublimation ink on them, and we've already put our easy press mat covered by butcher paper inside. So we know that everything's protected. We will just put this into place and\nyou can just tape it down really well. You don't want it to move during the pressing process. And we'll also have some centers, so I'm gonna leave that\ncenter open just a minute, and we'll tape in just a second. So now I just have the\ncenters of all those letters. And again, we want to make\nsure to put those face down on their corresponding letter, and then we'll tape every\nsingle one of those down really, really well, making sure\nnothing moves when we press. All right, so to press this design, we will need to cover\nit to protect our press. So I'm gonna use a piece of\nthat protective paper again. So you have the paper, then\nthe sublimation ink design, that glitter HTV that we\npressed underneath that, the shirt, another piece\nof protective paper, and our easy press mat. And then I have the back of the shirt and another easy press mat just under there to protect everything. And now we're gonna press\nat that 360, 120 seconds, and you don't want anything to move. So we're gonna press it down, press the C and hold it with\npressure for the full time, not allowing anything to move. All right, so after the time's complete, again, we don't want anything to move. We're gonna lift it straight up, and then we're gonna allow\nthis to cool completely before we move this. All right, this is completely cool now. And we are going to start peeling back. And see what we got. So you can see that effect\non that glitter HTV, that kind of watercolor effect, where it's going from like a\npink to a blue at the bottom. And there, you have it. So sublimation on glitter HTV. Now let's move on and see what happens when we use that flock. Alright, so for the flocks\nwe need to be at 305 for 10 seconds. So I went ahead and set\nmy easy press to that, and that's going to be\ncooling down while we work. I went ahead and pressed\nover the top of this, just to remove any wrinkles or moisture. All right. The flocked, once again, we did not mirror it and it\nhas lots of little pieces. So we need to get it from this\nbacking paper onto the shirt. There is transfer tape that's\nmade for heat transfer vinyl. This is a piece of that here. You could also use a\npiece from an old project. So this was just from\nthe glitter I just used, that we just did the home, and I can just press that right onto here. So it's rated for use\nwith something like HTV. And so I can just use it as long as it'll kind of lift up from there. And the only thing when working with this, when working with the\ntransfer tape and HTV is the transfer tape is never, or I don't find it's ever\nlike really, really sticky. So you just kinda have to play with it and kind of peel it back. Just kind of play with it, peel it back and just make\nsure that it's staying stuck to your, whatever you use, transfer tape, an old carrier sheet, whatever. And then watch when you get to\nthe centers of those letters, they actually stay down and into place. So I'm just gonna keep\nmoving across this piece, making sure everything\ngets stuck to this tape, and then we'll press it\nand add that sublimation, just like we did on the glitter. So here's our piece completely\non this transfer tape. So I can just flip that over carefully and add it to our shirt. Now the easy press has cooled down to 305 and I have it set for 10 seconds. And we're just going to\nmake sure this is about in the center and that it's straight. And then, once again I've\ngot an easy press mat inside of my shirt covered\nby some protective paper, because I know I will be\nsublimating here in a few minutes it will just save me an\nextra step here to do that. So we're gonna press this 305,\n10 seconds, light pressure. And we'll remove that easy press. And you can actually remove\nthis liner while hot, just to make sure that it's not so hot it's gonna burn you. And we just want to make\nsure everything is stuck. Now we have that flock right on our shirt. And remember, this is\nthat polyester flock. So we can put our\nsublimation ink right on top. We are gonna wait until this\ncools off so that it doesn't start sublimating while we're adjusting. And then we'll do it just like the glitter where we'll put it in\nplace and tape it down. All right, so everything\nis taped down well where it won't move. And we're gonna put our\nprotective sheet on top of it. So protective sheet, the paper with the\nsublimation ink face down, taped down well to the flocked that's already attached to\nour shirt, protective paper, easy press mat, back of the\nshirt, another easy press mat. We're gonna press this down. And it's 360, 120 seconds, firm pressure. Then once your time is up,\nyou wanna lift it straight up so nothing moves. Then we went to allow this\nto cool completely before we remove the paper with the sublimation ink. All right, I've allowed this to cool. And now we can reveal the\nmagic and see if we have that watercolor design on that flocked paper, on that flock HTV. And it looks amazing. Totally awesome. All right, so there is how\nyou add sublimation ink to both flocked and glitter HTV. So it's super simple. And I know the first question\ny'all are gonna ask is how well does it hold up in the laundry? Well, I'm gonna tell you right\nnow that I have already ran these through the laundry\ntwice, both of these shirts. So you can see that\nthere was like no fading. That is absolutely 100% fine. Yes, you can still laundry these shirts and not have any problems. So if you were to use\nsublimation ink directly on the cotton without the glitter HTV or the flocked HTV between it, when you went to throw it\nin the washing machine, it would fade. So it would give you like\na really distressed look. It would be kind of semi-permanent. So a lot of it would come\nout as you laundered it. And I don't know how long\nit would last actually, but I actually ran these through twice just to kind of see what\nwould happen the first and the second time. And both the glitter HTV from B-Flex as well as the flocked can be dried. So actually ran both these\nthrough the dryer as well, no issues at all. So if you're gonna drop down\nbelow and ask that question, there's your answer\nright before you ask it. But if you have any other questions about anything we've covered today, feel free to ask those in\nthe comment section below. Also head to the description below, grab your supplies to give this technique a try for yourself. If you've wanted to try sublimation, you hate polyester shirts. I've heard that over and over again. I hate polyester shirts, or maybe you want to put it on a hat and all you can find are cotton hats. This is a solution. So glitter, heat transfer vinyl, as well as the flocks. Now the flocks you wanna make sure it has a polyester coating. I know that multiple glitters will work, but the flocked I am not sure about. So the only flock I tried was this B-Flex that's made specifically for sublimation. So I would definitely give that one a try. And I do not know about\nany of the rest of those. So if you are looking at another brand, I do not know if those will work. And I have only tried, I've seen other people try other glitters, but I've only tried\nthe glitter from B-Flex just to let you know that as well.

We have videos like this all the time, and you don't want to miss any of those. I hope you enjoyed these\nshirts today and will try this watercolor technique for yourself. Again, the markers I use were the Artesprix sublimation markers, they also come in a\nwide variety of colors. So this is the 10 pack with\nlike the standard colors. I think you saw those in the video, but they also come in\nother colors as well. If you are interested in\nexpanding beyond the basic colors, but you can do the technique\nthat I use, where I took those and I kinda mixed them\ntogether on that plastic bag and create kind of all\nkinds of your own colors just by buying one pack. Thank you all so much for joining me and I will see you next\nweek with another fun video.

got to turn my tv down okay so as promised i'm going to show you all a new solution on how to do sublimation on cotton um textiles okay so you're gonna need a spray bottle and you're going to need eight ounces of water in here and then you're gonna need this minwax polycrylic okay i got the clear gloss finish i don't know if the finish matters this is what i happen to get so hopefully it works okay um this is my first time doing it i saw jlo's creations on youtube i'll link her video this is originally how i uh saw this idea she's the first person who i've seen to do it this way and i'm gonna try it so i'll be sure to link her videos so you guys can check her out if you want to see how she did it so at any rate eight ounces of water two tablespoons of this poly acrylic all right so the price for this was 22 this was 17 and some change and then this was three dollars and some change so 22 dollars and look how much you're getting okay two tablespoons is nothing out of this i mean i can use this probably forever and when i bought this these are four ounces so i got two four ounce bottles off of etsy and so again you know you be the judge and i think i paid around it's on sale now because i just look but i paid around 20 some odd dollars for this so price wise they were about the same but what you get and obviously how they work are going to be totally different so um yeah let's go ahead and make the solution all right so we got a really good shake and obviously if you want to make more make more you can fill this thing all the way up just for every eight ounces of water do two tablespoons of polycrylic okay and i'm gonna get our shirt over here i've been waiting wanting to do this project on these two little shirts i got from um hobby lobby they were on clearance so i've been waiting to use them for something so this will be perfect i'm going to do like um a little theme or something on them [Music] i want to spray honey but is it open oh my god wasn't over and pretty much you want to [Music] like really get this thing wet um i don't like the spray bottle i'm gonna be honest with y'all cause it doesn't have the oopsies and i broke it broke this try to get you a nozzle that actually is a sprayer not one that just has this single spray like get one that sprays like evenly because i don't like this um all righty so what i'm going to do is sit this under the um heat press not actually put the plate down but just sit it on the um heat press is our is heat oh it's not even heating up it's already at 400 degrees so i'm just gonna kind of let this i guess dry by that heat while i do the other one and um the tutorial that i saw she actually put her stuff in she let it air dry she let one air dry and she let one dry in the dryer i'm gonna heat press these to dry them but first um like i said i'm gonna sit this underneath the heat press just kind of let it chill there until i'm done with the other one okay probably should use gloves too sorry you should probably use gloves all right and out of that solution we started out with eight ounces i'm probably at like the five ounce line all right so this two will go under the heat press and see you guys over there [Music] [Applause] [Music] so this looks like it may take longer than i was expecting so i am going to throw this stuff in the dryer y'all just to speed up the process because i have a few other things to get to today so we're going to put this in a dryer all right you guys so basically here we have it okay this is our um our prints i got both of these off of etsy i don't know for some reason the quality on this one doesn't seem as nice as this one and i did not distort it a lot but um that's what i have these were in a dryer they do have a little bit of stiffness about them from going in the dryer i'm not sure why that is but they do have a little bit of stiffness to them all right so it's hot i know [Music] okay so see that right there the black hair didn't go didn't get absorbed all the way another thing is that i think i was way too high 400 degrees is way too high for this considering i put a chemical solution on here so look at that see how it's yellowing around there which i know there's ways to fix that um i don't really care to fix it oh that's hot and here's our little boss man so how do i like this they're okay there is some yellowing and y'all i honestly is getting late because this kind of was a long process does it work absolutely does work um oh that's hot but that looked a lot better this looks a lot better than the shirt i did yesterday for corey and this is pink and that was a gray shirt so there's no way that this light pink should be popping to me any more than a gray shirt um i obviously didn't put enough solution there so it's important to saturate well because the black hair didn't really take but you guys it does work and it can be done this black is a little iffy too but overall y'all it does look good i'm actually going to wash them i'm going to wash them and see if this residue comes off and so we can get a test on how they look after they've been washed so i'm gonna do that too so anyway y'all don't forget to like comment subscribe let me know um what you guys think about this do you all think that it's worth you know doing your own poly um poly tea spray or not even poly tea spray but doing your own sublimation spray and doing these shirts definitely will play around with the heat settings i most certainly will be doing this again and i think i'm going to lower my temperature to 350 and i'm going to do it in 60 second increments and then going from there i think 400 is too high especially considering we sprayed a chemical on there that's the first mistake so we'll definitely redo it so anyway all right y'all bye hey guys so i am back and here are the shirts with after they've been washed and i don't know if you all recall this one the pigment wasn't that great to begin with and it's definitely horrible now and i think that the color even bled not think it did the color bled after washing and it set for a few days and you guys can see the splotches where the color wasn't even to begin with with this one and of course it did fade um the image is still there i don't know what's so different about this then have we not treated it versus have we um versus how we did treat it like if using cotton so i don't know how helpful this is to you all but this is the after the wash i will insert a picture of the befores and do i feel that it's worth it no not really could it also be user error most certainly you guys know that that was my first time doing it i can definitely try it again and see how it turns out oh and then for corey's y'all his was even worse i used the um poly t sublimation spray for his did i look at that his face is completely gone you do see the tick tock name but look at that this is completely gone and that's using the [Music] subletty spray from etsy so yeah that's this time i can try it again i may try it again guys using something smaller see if i can get better results and i'll follow instructions by the t for the subletting because i didn't lose it but i did take a screenshot so hopefully possibly i can redo it and follow the directions to the t for the poly t and then for the acrylic for the poly acrylic and water i don't know i can try it again y'all and see what else we can come up with but this was the wash test and they do not pass in my book so yeah um if y'all have any suggestions comments leave them down below and let's talk about it bye y'all", "8n19izIis4k": "so I use the dryer earlier and the lint trap is filled with fluff ooh more fluff I just simply lick my finger that way I can scrape out more but others you can top I don't know what kind of dryer you have it also builds up a lot you don't want that going back on your clothes so clean out the lint trap before you use the dryer each time towels are nice to be dried in the dryer because they get softer but I wouldn't put the dryer on in the summertime just for soft towels that's what fabric softeners for also because I hate hate hate ironing all these cotton shirts I hang them up right away and I put them right on the hanger that way you don't have that extra step even in the spring and summer I'll put it on the hanger and then hang the whole hanger right on the line put a little clothes peg in between so that they don't slide when you move to move the line okay so I have all my shirts that I can't put in the dryer on hangers and if you have a sturdy shower rod you know that holds your curtain you can hang them on that okay so I have this handy chin up bar that I can hang clothes off of if they're only there for a few hours and yes I will admit it is inconvenient but I'd rather have a little bit of inconvenience and clothes that don't fit", "I9kgTaieozI": "[Music] you too what is going on it is your boy easy it ain't easy being Kesey and if you are new to this channel we talk anything from clothing music to culture and if you're into any of that stuff I recommend for you to subscribe so on that note today we are switching it up just a little bit and I have some comparisons that I've been wanting to do so I've waited about a week and a half to do this to make this video and what this is all about is oversized t-shirt I've recently kind of got back into oversized t-shirts which kind of just look like baggy shirts from back in the day except the cut is just a little bit different but today we're gonna be comparing minimal to all style okay and more specifically it is the 1301 style for all style and it is the drop tee or oversized tee for minimal it I'm pretty sure it's called drop tee but there's so many names for this like oversized t-shirt but I'm pretty sure to drop to you right on their website as we speak now if you're interested in the old style right off the bat all styles are always available there on Amazon their own eBay they're on all different types of blank websites as far as minimal girls I don't my guess is that this is something that they have all year round but it can also not be something that they have all year round unfortunately enough I have a size large and an extra large and a 13:01 and for the minimal I have a white enlarge and then I have a size medium in the black and the reason why I have black color is because they ran out of size medium and white so I have to compromise okay and how we're gonna format this video is that I'm just going to try them on give you my raw opinion of it and then afterwards I'm gonna give you some measurements and then kind of answer some questions at the very end and then wrap up the video the first one I'm gonna try on is the size large in the white from minimal before I even try this on I'm gonna be honest with you this thing looks huge this thing looks massive but let's give it a shot are really huge but ii thought too thick not too thin but this is wow this is huge dude Oh Dawg Dawg I'm swimming dude oh my god big man this is too big this is way too big to size large and most t-shirts but like this's I understand it's a drop tea but God can't see my elbows man without being said let's try on the medium for minimal perhaps the same material all right so this is doable and doable size medium of the minimal drop tea though I recommend I already recommend buy a size down from the minimal drop teas or an oversized t-shirt this is exactly what I'd be looking for I think that how to buy like a regular sized t-shirt that is not a drop teat it would just be too long on the bottom if it's oversized so it's nice that it kind of it kind of stops a little early compared to most just regular t-shirts I guess let's go ahead and try on the old style so this is a size large which isn't bad this kind of just fits exactly like because it's 1601 or just a regular adult team it's not bad I do wish that the sleeves came down a little bit longer since that being said let's try on the extra large with a extra large is just way too big I was saying earlier with regular size t-shirts this is kind of like a regular size t-shirt got this specific style recommended to me from another youtuber which I'll try to link up in description if I find it again he said 1301 is a good for oversized t-shirt but right now I'm gonna say that this is a no like this is huge oh mighty like this is a very big shirt alrighty and I got some pretty skinny sweats on right now I just I look like I'm stuck back in 2003 [Music] like this is not this is not it man this is really big I mean if he came up just a little bit more they'd be cut off like right here area it probably would have worked but this is just it's too big man I don't ok so just very quick on paracin that we have here so we got the minimal here obviously they do a lot more brand heavy stuff for their garments so you got your minimal tag here which is pretty cool and then they give you this tag as well the minimal one I paid about 20 bucks you also want to get about 10 dollars but this material is a lot better I think the black one that I'm wearing right now that I was just showing you guys that one I don't know why but it feels better than this white one that they made but again the material this one's a lot better now their white is a little see-through I know it's hard to tell because though my white light right now is shining directly on top of it but in real life put this on and then you have a pair of pants on or something like that or something more reviewing on the inside it's gonna show something dark it's gonna show which is a little unfortunate but as far as all foul that won't happen to you because their garments are pretty thick as it is but that's kind of arguably where all style kind of is a little disappointing sometimes is because sometimes I wear all style and it's like really cold outside and it works because it's kind of thick but then sometimes it's really hot outside and I don't want to wear an all style t-shirt because it's just too it's too much it just it doesn't feel as comfortable as something like this that's like a little bit thinner I don't know if I want to say better quality but it's it's softer and a thinner and air runs through it a little bit better air doesn't always run through an all style t-shirt as well as it should but I'm a little disappointed in this all style I thought it was going to come and gonna kind of fit like a drop tee but it didn't end up fitting like a drum - you just ended up fitting like a regular adult all style t-shirt which I don't personally like I don't and I'm not that fond of that the caller's are very very different - with the minimal you got this like collar that is a lot softer obviously from an all style all style collars tend to be a little bit rough sometimes this is a lot softer but the drawback with these type of like minimal collars is that if you wash it too many times they get a little crinkly and and it just it feels funky man just to be very honest it feels kind of weird after a while and it feels very used either right now it's good obviously cuz it's brand new now these cup of college they'll last you a long time but they're not always the most comfortable colors in the world they're very thick and like I meant it in the summertime it could be a little too thick now to my understanding I believe all style is made here in the US if I'm not mistaken it could also be made in China and then imported here and you know however they do that but my guess from the materials that I see on the minimal I haven't even looked yet but they're my guest of the materials on the minimal it's got to be from Pakistan maybe China but probably Pakistan or somewhere in the Middle East quick let me see if they have tag on the inside here as I suspected made in India now I don't know what it is about this specific material and also these type of collars I've ordered a lot of blanks myself with my own clothing brand name and like looking into different manufacturers that make it different types of collars and materials and I don't know why but this material just it just speaks either China or India or Pakistan to me and I was kind of like dead-on right on the money with that I mean you should be either determinant of which one kind of fits you best okay so you're gonna do some very quick measurement wean all style here and minimal these are both a size large got the height thirty inches and for the minimal 29 to 30 inches now if we take the width of this t-shirt about 21 inches and be minimal is coming in about 25 significant difference the minimal is almost two and a half to three inches wider than your all style if we take the measurement of caller to the sleeve you have about 16 inches here and collar to the sleeve there's about 19 inches cut on this is obviously a lot better to achieve the oversized look and the all style isn't doing so hot I remember that these are both size large and also remember that all style you know they didn't purposely make this t-shirt to be an oversized t-shirt or oversized fit but remember minimal they are meant to be an oversized fit I recommend whatever your true to size is go one size down in this and if you really want the whole style then go one size up and then maybe you can tailor it later to fit yourself you know better but this one is pretty off to the actual look that we're trying to achieve today I don't know okay closing the video out I will say that minimal had blown this one out of the water but I mean it almost came to no surprise that minimal was better than the all styles because you know all styles the purpose of the all style was is not supposed to be an oversized t-shirt I mean you could buy one size up depending on your body type or whatever if I was a little bit taller then yeah the XL would have worked for me but the the large just felt like a regular ol style t-shirt large like an adult t-shirt large which I don't like that sizing of that right now and then the extra large just felt huge you just felt massive no different than the size large in the minimal that one also felt massive but the medium that I have on is a perfect size I like how much it kind of covers the elbows a little bit but to achieve that oversized look and 20 bucks for the t-shirt it does feel like a lot of money to buy one shirt for a blank shirt for twenty dollars but minimal does a pretty decent job at there are some other brand names that do do it too but this was the only one that was kind of more accessible towards me towards online so I happen to buy the minimal and I thought I'd do the comparison today so hopefully this video was helpful don't say I want to say this now all style is not a cheaper alternative as of what I think about the 13:01 if somebody knows a another style number that is a good comparable style words fit or cut to an oversized t-shirt better than 1301 now please message me I would love to know which one that one is or another brand I would love to do another comparison so anyways closing this out make sure you guys keep it lock right here for all your latest information for music fashion to culture it is your boy and I'll see you next time peace sign up

that's not why don't get my head in here but I'm gonna show you real quick so we're gonna take a full own full willing to take up 100% cotton shirt I'm gonna take our decal pre-cut pre-cut I cut this before the before I even thought about my video but here it is oh this is easy we easy we gold in black it's not took up next two colors but that's not how it comes why should he cut this one separate and then I just put it there nope okay so what you want to do is pre-heat your garment so you can get all the moisture out from two three seconds and then apply your decals or in this case your he press material make sure it's straight I've been doing this for quite awhile so just make sure you're straight and then you're gonna apply heat or you can apply yeah you apply heat for about 15 seconds and it should be ready now when you open this when you open the clamshell if you see a lot of steam come out its kiss either you didn't get you to remove all the steam don't worry it's okay as long as you he press it for 15 to 18 seconds you're gonna see a lot of steam come out one of the reasons why you're gonna see a lot of the steam come out is because it's freezing here I'm in Waco Texas and right now it's about 27 degrees so that's why you're gonna see a steam come off not you see a lot of it which is good so then you just feel it this is a pure hot um you can either peel it how to peel it cold excuse me doesn't matter if you feel like harder for peel it cold it's okay so what you want to do this is what I like using this material you see weed by sizes on people call it Caesar size or whatever you want to call it this is this is reason why I like using this one second so clamp it down look check it out check that out ready to go so if you if you're doing multiple colors if you're gonna apply another color and talk with this one this materials perfect perfect for that this is one second the NATO beef I here to the shirt but you still got to do the the actual 14 15 to 18 seconds so it's undergarment very easy very quick we're gonna make a bunch of this the shirts with the princesses for it sex sex reveal not a baby shower sex video um I don't know party whatever they will call it it so mom and dad are having this for the sex reveal there you go [Applause] here we go now we're gonna start playing the pink ones and I see notice the other one said

videos once a week next week we're gonna be posting videos on screen printing at home and making or having a home-based business thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next video", "maoUzT6aYqc": "hey everyone I'm Brittany with heat press nation and in this video I'm going to show you how to sublimate a t-shirt [Music] if this is your first time with us on YouTube please subscribe to our Channel and click the notification bells so that you're up to date on new tutorials live episodes and more from heat pressed nation if you're looking for more details on sublimation we have our sublimation starts here playlist which can be watched right now by clicking the card above let's get started one of the top reasons for sublimating onto a t-shirt is that you get a photo quality image with super vibrant colors not only that but since you're dyeing the shirt the transfer doesn't feel like it's there at all also making it very light to wear lastly sublimation is a permanent solution and has fantastic wash ability if you're new to sublimation are doing your research on it here's a quick look at what you'll need to sublimate a t-shirt first is a sublimation printing system which is a specialized printer ink and paper made specially for sublimation if you want more details on these systems check out our category page at heat dot press / sublimation for this video shirt a print out my transfer with a sawgrass printer with sublogic HD ink you'll also need a heat press I'll be working with our 15 by 15 inch craft pro and of course we will need a t-shirt I'll be transferring onto a hundred percent polyester t-shirt because of the nature of the sublimation process you can't use organic materials like cotton the dye simply will not stick to it for the best most clear and vibrant results go with a hundred percent polyester I'm going to print up my design on the Sawgrass printer using the Sawgrass print manager this program optimizes my printers output so my colors will be true once sublimated it also mirrors the image by default and has a lot of other helpful functions as well notice how my printout looks a little dull and washed out this is totally normal since sublimation inks don't reach their full brilliance until heated up so once we sublimate this transfer onto our t-shirt the colors are really gonna pop we recommend using a pressing pillow for sublimation as I'll help prevent press marks from being left on polyester shirts for the sake of demonstration I'll go ahead and press my shirt without one for now we're first going to Center our shirt on the lower platen and pre press for about three seconds pre pressing the shirt helps eliminate any moisture in the shirt and also gives us a smooth flat surface to work with we're going to place our printed sublimation transfer ink side down on our shirt I'm going to eyeball the center for this demo but you can use an alignment tool like a t-square to get more professional results when placing your transfers before pressing be sure to cover your transfer with the piece of parchment paper to protect our heating element from any out gas dye or bleed through if you're using a thinner t-shirt you may need to slip a piece of parchment paper inside the shirt to block any bleed through to the back or onto your pressing pillow next I'll slide the lower platen back in and press my team for 50 seconds at 385 degrees Fahrenheit the sweet spot for sublimating garments is between 385 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and 45 to 60 seconds for this particular graphic on this shirt I found that 385 degrees for 50 seconds works perfectly depending on your heat press t-shirt ink system our local climate you may find the need to use more or less heat and our time we always recommend performing several test presses with different settings to see what works best for you all right so our shirt is done since I didn't fix the transfer in place with any heat tape or adhesive spray I want to avoid shifting the hot transfer on the surface of the shirt if the ink on the transfer paper is still hot it may still release onto my shirt so if it shifts it may leave us the imprint on the shirt this would result in a blurred look that's commonly referred to as ghosting so I'm going to remove the parchment paper carefully and I'll usually give the transfer a few seconds to air cool before I pill it off and again we want to avoid the transfer from shifting so I'll just pull it off quickly like a band-aid pulling up and away from the tee and there you go we have a gorgeous sublimated t-shirt I wish you could reach into your screen and touch this shirt because it's super soft you literally cannot feel a thing this transfer is soft vibrant high-resolution

downtown LA home\nof the fashion district where creative entrepreneurs brands and businesses come\nto shop and sell the latest styles now whether you guys are consumers or\nactually in the fashion industry chances are you've seen rolls of fabric like\nthese which actually go on to become the products that you wear now virtually\nevery brand and business gets their start with a simple t-shirt crew neck\nand hoody and more importantly is a very interesting fact is they don't actually\nmanufacture the products themselves in fact a lot of the times are being\nmanufactured in large facilities so as a consumer you need to know that you have\nthe option and the choice to impact the world at large\nby the businesses that you'll go on to support so in this video I want to peel\nback some layers and actually show you guys how products are created on a mass\nlevel and I thought it'd be really interesting to start with how these\nfabrics are actually made cotton the most popular fabric in the world is\ncreated from the ground up before being made into the fabrics you wear it begins\nin the field where it has grown and picked by industrial equipment and\nshipped to be processed during the processing stage the cotton is cleaned\nup removing impurities and then the soft fluffy cotton you see becomes a strong\nfiber the process here is designed to create combed and ring spun cotton that\nhas a softer feel this type of fabric goes through an innovative spinning\nprocess that's designed to thoroughly soften and straighten each fiber the\nstrands will then tightly knit and woven together to create a raw fabric that is\nnow strong enough to be worn next time you're choosing a shirt take a look at\nthe fine details to see this for yourself\nonce the fabric is completed and then gets transported to a dye house where\nthe fabric is dyed to the color specified by the manufacturer the\nprocess we're showing you here is unique to Bella canvas which is the largest\ncutter and dhyryam apparel in America we take you guys inside of the state of the\nart facility to show you what it takes to make quality apparel for millions of\npeople all over the world as you see once this fabric is dyed it gets\ntransported as these fabric rolls which are then laid out across large\ncutting tables the fabric is stacked up to a hundred and fifty layers before it\nbeing mass cut inside of this factory they cut three million units a week and\nI personally always wanted to see how these machines layout the fabric so\nlet's take it out for a spin what's the worst that can happen so right out of\nthe gate there's this machine here and it has like all of these different\nsettings and I see this little this thing so I could just move this and it\nworks I'm going to reverse though huh let's let's crank this thing up but the whole thing my privado I messed up this fall\nI dig I think I did a bad job that's that's that's bad huh - push the button\nthere that is odd this buddy right here tightens up the rope\nshameless crap okay I'm gonna try it again how much right right\nyou know at first glance these machine seemed to move themselves but what I\nfound out is that it actually requires some skill in order to tighten the\ntension of the fabric as it's being laid out the faster you go the faster that\ntrigger fingers got to be in order to keep up once the fabrics are laid out\nthe cutting machine arrives to cut the fabric in the shape of the required\ndesign this is the cutting machine that essentially takes all the digital\npatterns that are created during the design stage and they input it into the\nsoftware which allows this machine to just automatically cut the panels which\nare then shipped to the facilities where they're going to be sewing right here I\ndon't know if you guys can see the screen but it's literally showing you\nwhere it's going to be cutting next and as it's cutting it's actually vacuuming\nthe entire operation so it vacuums that in order to make sure that the seal and\nthe fabrics lay very flat so there's no differences when it's actually cut these\nrobotic cutting machines ensure every single piece is cut precisely as it\nfollows a designer's blueprint keep in mind not every factory has something\nlike this these machines make it possible to get a consistent fitting\nshirt every single time once the panels are cut they are placed on carts and\nmove to the next part of the process and so just wanted to take you guys behind\nthe scene here as we as we show you guys where this fabric is\ngoing before it's being sewn and it got my boy Brett got the man see\nright over there but guys an interesting thing that we saw here is as you can see\nright here these are actually not moving so it makes you wonder how is that\nmoving right so I wanted to show you guys something really quickly here in\nbetween these lines here there's actually lasers so there's a laser\nguided system that actually brings the fabric as soon as it crosses a path it\nactivates the new beams here so let's check this out\nmoving not moving and moving haha check this out go check this out\nbring the camera a little closer moving not moving and moving yeah this is how\nthe fabrics are transported in masses in order for them to be bundled and finally\ncut so what oh you would have thought these\ntwo crashed right now but they didn't because of the way that everything is\nbeing automated and I feel that automation in the sewing process and in\nthe manufacturing facilities such as this that's based in Los Angeles with\nAmerican workers it's it's the way well it really is the way of the future and\ncompanies like Bella canvas are able to still produce a USA strong while being\nable to sew in different countries and put out a quality product so this is the\nway that things are moving and like this fabric let's get moving over to the\nbundling stage we can show you guys how that works\nso these fabrics back here as you guys can\nis the bundling machine so it's it's making sure that the fabrics are safe as\nthey're being transported to the next facility which actually does the selling\nthem investing into these types of logistics allows them to keep a quality\nproduct from the beginning all the way until it's done the scale of this\noperation is huge guys and as you guys can see from the forklifts to the\ncutters to everybody that's that's a part of this operation it really is\nsomething that requires a huge investment in the production as well as\nthe logistics and the team behind it thousands of people are employed here in\norder to get this to actually work so you could imagine that it's it's easier\nto cut corners than it is to do things right so when a company invests in doing\nthings the right way it really makes a difference in the market and it really\nmakes a difference in the world with rap fabric ready to be transported these\ncontainers play a logistical role in transporting materials needed for\nvarious parts of the production process globally these containers travel and\ncarry mass quantities of gray's goods which come from all over the world\nwhich are then dyed in an eco-friendly way in Los Angeles a fun fact is that\nthe USA China and India produce over 50% of the world's cotton this business\nchooses to die unprocessed fabric in Los Angeles in order to reduce the\nenvironmental impact commonly associated with Daiya fabrics in other parts of the\nworld once they are cut and dyed the majority the production is transported\nto Central America where they are sewn up and shipped back to the US a\nfulfillment center since we know how fabric is being dyed and transported for\nproduction we are wondering how they ensure the sewing factors are taking\ncare of their people and environment we spoke with Xavier to get the details you\nknow Bella canvas is making sure that every factory that is part of our supply\nchain is 100% certified by ara which is a certification that is granted to\ncompanies that are fully in compliance with labor laws and regulations in the\ndifferent countries where we operate the efforts that we made to make sure that\nyou know the workers that are part of our supply chain are being treated\nfairly not only in terms of other compensation also but you know all the\nsocial benefits that they receive recently we were approve also to become\na participating company with the Fair Labor Association which is like at the\ngold standard for our industry we are in the process of certifying the entire\nsupply chain is a it's a lengthy process and it will take some time but\neventually the company will be fully activated with the VFL a North America\nis made up of multiple Latin American countries and although sewing also\noccurs outside of the USA Bella canvas promotes a USA strong initiative which\nemploys thousands of workers in the USA while also producing a line of apparel\nthat is made here in the Los Angeles facility so as you guys to see right\nhere in this sewing factory they have literally over a hundred and fifty\nemployees skilled employees actually sewing the t-shirts in right here as you\nguys can see on this stack these are the cup panels we were showing you guys\nearlier more importantly I just wanted to share with you guys some of my\nthoughts in and some of the things that happen in the factories such as this the\nskill that's required to actually do a job like this so this is my man Felix\nright here and I won't I won't disturb his work that much but as you guys can\nsee it requires very skilled thought so with that being said a lot of workers\nactually only do one part of every garment which then goes on to the next\nperson to complete it and funny enough to show you guys like how difficult it\nmight be my brother actually over here my brother actually knows how to sew and\nwe were discussing like hey are you okay so you're already making excuses do you\nthink you can do it or not alright so Felix get a mpirica ladder\ncomo la so this machine is like it's this is a Pegasus w6\nand it's very beefy so they have two needles so right out of the gate we see\nthat there's there's a reason why workers are actually focusing on one\ntask so there's a lot of little pieces to the garment and if you were to try to\nsew everything yourself you'd probably screw up the entire shirt or a won't be\nas efficient so my brother Caesar here is is skilled in this if I were to try I\nwould have probably lost my finger but look at this guy he's actually doing it what's going on here guys you're holding\nup my line we got it good thank you guys for bringing us behind the scenes here\nand our that my brother slowed down the production line now you have to get can\nyeah but but overall you guys seem to be running a really tight ship how many\nunits do you think about the canvas is producing on on any given day so about a\nweek we're showing about three million units three million t-shirts so the\naverage of about 600,000 teachers per day oh yeah that's crazy\nbut what would you say is like is one of the things that the workers here need to\nhave in order to be successful in this career how many years have they been\nsewing for so some of these people have been working with us from the beginning\nso about you know 10 15 years they've been here it's people that I come here\nevery day they're being they're been here ever since at the beginning you\nknow what type of fulfillment do you think\nthey find in the sewing do you think they need to have a passion to work in a\nfactory like this you definitely have to you definitely have to enjoy it\nbut as you can see everybody comes in here and everybody's pretty happy you\nknow not sad faces yeah yeah it's definitely something that it's part of\nour culture now you know we're a big family\nwhat's the products are sown they undergo a quality control process that\nensures every t-shirt meets their test it's pretty crazy to see that there are\nreal people working on every single t-shirt that you wear so this is one\nthat passed the test right here yeah this is one that can go out to a\ncustomer yeah definitely ready to go and I think that's the beauty of like what a\nlot of people don't get to see is the fact that even though things are being\nmass-produced there's real people are like handling\nyou're populating it and there's real love that goes into it or a real passion\nyou got to have a passion for sewing and you got to have a passion for this\nindustry in order to stay in it with what 15 years yeah so it's a lot of time\nand energy that goes into one garment and it's a lot of people that handle\nthat one garment yeah it's about from the beginning to\nthe end there's about 13 13 people that but you know the teacher goes through\ninto it's completed not counting people into distributions in there yeah\nliterally hundreds of hands are going into the making of your product that you\nget at home and I think a lot of time we do miss the fact that there is a\npersonal touch to every single garment you guys whether it's mass-produced or\nwhether it's this is could be considered handmade I mean it really is because\nsomebody's making it with their hands so with that being said I wanted to leave a\nlittle note here you think I can leave a note in this box yeah there's like made\nwith love regardless of whether the finished garments come from their\nCentral American manufacturing facilities or in LA they ultimately\narrive at the fulfillment center where they are responsible for organizing and\nshipping to distributors and brands all over the world many entrepreneurs and\nsmall businesses rely on Bella canvas and suppliers like them to stock t-shirt\nblanks that can use to sell their designs now this company doesn't stay in\nbusiness by simply selling random designs and a bigger challenge that they\nalso have is the fact that they're selling to customers of all shapes and\nsizes so design wise they have to cater to a very large market so\nwant to go ahead and actually show you guys the behind the scenes of what it\nactually takes to design for a mass markets for millions of customers all\naround the world and we're actually going to see how they choose the colors\nthat are guaranteed to sell through to a large audience let's check that out man\nright out of the gate so this is where you guys do fittings yeah this is our\nfit room we spend a few hours a week in here with models and styles and we just\nmake sure that the styles fit on our base size models the best the best we\ncan interesting what is so like as I walked\nthrough here I felt like my equilibrium was almost off because it obviously\nthere's a sound panel but we'll the purpose for a sound panel enjoy cool\nwell no this is actually the Ellsworth Kelly from 1956 it's a sound barrier\nyeah he's a California abstract painter it's actually the exactly just absorb\nsound like so we're not bouncing around the room and little easier to tolerate\neach other I thought I had like a real like I thought it was a real pain I mean\nI don't think I'd be behind a glass door if that were the case of a real pretty\ncool so this is where you guys fit your models because you guys designed for\nmillions of people different body types all right we did we tried right you try\nwe're trying our very best so so how can you walk us through how how you are able\nto do that we want to fit on multitude of body shapes and sizes we'll start\nwith a base size size medium men's for instance for a unisex t-shirt 3001 we'll\nstart with our men's medium he's our basic block and so we start\nfitting on him when we have it tuned up the way we like the way it fits the\ndrape performance will go on to the next size so we'll fit eventually a full size\nrun so if there's a small all the way to like 4 XL let's say we'll fit every\nsingle size yeah so we're trying to take those silhouettes into consideration so\nyou mentioned earlier that you like to work directly with the manufacturing\nteam so as a design director how does working with the manufacturing arm make\nsure that what you guys are creating is going to be something beneficial for the\nworld at large working on the ground level just getting to the factory we\nhave a communication line that help is build product the delicate design\nprograms that we have we try to make sure that there's no pieces in between\nour sewing and our brains or the to the design vision and the sellers are kind\nof on the same page we develop fabrics and samples we send them back and forth\nuntil we alekhya them exactly the way we see them fit in a production setting and\nthat's important to us so that's part of the reason we have that connectivity\ntissue between sewing and the design vision is that we close the gap on all\nthe pieces that would go wrong by seeing each other in person by working together\nas a team so far as that this is super detailed process they are very\nmeticulous about what they do and the whole team is here to make adjustments\nin case there's anything to be done so this isn't the first sample set that\nthey had to actually fit this is actually a rendition so what they're\ndoing is essentially making sure that it all goes to spec before it hits the mass\nproduction okay so we're just gonna run through the specs again really quick and\nlike for instance the shirt I'm wearing this is actually one of you guys is more\nlater styles so this is something that you and your team came up with yeah so\nwhat what what inspires you for new designs and how do those like how do you\nguys kind of maybe make sure that they stay in the market for a while versus it\njust being a trend yeah this might be a trend you know it's a raw edge\ntranscends like I can't say this will be in the word forever is very scary\nfashion forever don't really jive certainly so what we'll try to do is\nwhat I like to see is like make the very best styrofoam cup that you can see at\nevery single coffee station forever without it leaking it's keeping its heat\nall those other components that the Styrofoam cup would have but ours is a\nbasic t-shirt we can dress it in skin it in different ways that speak to\ndifferent trends like raw edge seam work or pockets out to the side or however we\nwant to address it the core block that you see is our crewneck sweatshirt which\nwe feel very comfortable selling to a large community people can buy them\nprint on them embellish them in that market but in this case they can buy the\nnormal crew of pullover with raw edges everywhere it's\nmay get slightly more trend forward or fashion forward it's not enough to have\na great designer fit today as consumers we need to ensure that our purchasing\ndecisions do not support things that are unethical and oppressing others\nthat's where businesses such as these are raising the standards by not only\ngiving people an amazing product but by being transparent and doing things\ndifferently from how they treat their workers to the green initiatives in\nplace that are minimizing the environmental footprint on the other\nhand there are real problems happening around the world with apparel\nmanufacturing the constant drive to compete on price in order to sell\ngarments for pennies on the dollar as a resulted in producing in unsafe\nenvironments where buildings are failing and chemicals are being spilled into the\nenvironment the way your favorite products are being made today will\ndrastically affect the way our world looks like tomorrow now as we wrap up\nthis video I hope you enjoyed the process that we shared and how to shirts\nare made in America as you guys can see this operation is huge and the brands of\nbusinesses that you support also go through a process like this now the ones\nthat are just getting started the ones in your community that friends and\nfamily are be are actually creating are able to leverage resources such as bela\ncanvases infrastructure to actually make their brands and businesses without\nhaving to spend the millions of dollars that is required to do something like\nthis but more importantly as a consumer you have the power to choose the way\nthat the products are being created you see where you spend your money is what\nultimately is gonna dictate what the market and businesses such as these\ncreate so next time you go shopping or next time you're about to consider a\nbrand keep that in mind and more

every single week\nalso make sure to give a quick thumbs up to this video if you like content just\nlike this so as i said before i'm going to break\ndown the key differences and considerations for these two types of\nprinting methods but before we get into that i want to\nfirst give a quick intro on what heat transfer printing actually\nis now when we talk about heat transfer printing\nwe're talking specifically about a two-step method so what do those two\nsteps actually involve so step number one in this two-step heat transfer\nprinting method is actually printing a design onto a\ntransparent sheet of transfer paper then in step two\nyou actually transfer that design that was printed on\nthat transfer paper onto an adhesive paper using a heat\npress finally you peel away the adhesive sheet from the transfer\nsheet and then you press the design onto the substrate such as a piece of\ngarment using a heat press after pressing the garment you then peel\naway the actual paper and you're left with a design that's\ntransferred onto the garment itself the ricoma r550 white toner transfer printer\nuses this very two-step heat transfer method\nto apply designs onto various light and dark color garments even onto\nhard surfaces such as wood aluminum or even metal if\nyou're interested to learn more about white toner transfer printing and\nspecifically about the ricoma r550 white toner transfer printer packages\ngo ahead and click the link in the description below and check them out\nthere so now that we cover what is a two-step\nheat transfer printing system let's cover what is sublimation printing\nso sublimation printing involves a similar process where you're\nprinting the design onto regular copy paper or specialty\nsublimation paper and then using heat via a heat press to\ntransfer that printed design onto a substrate such as a piece of\ngarment the key difference lies in how sublimation works and the science behind\nit during sublimation when the actual\nprinted design is heated via a heat press\nthe toner on the transfer paper itself actually turns from\na solid state into a gas state and then it embeds itself\ninto the fabric when it cools it actually goes back to being installed\nand then becomes a permanent part of the fabric that means\nunlike a two-step heat transfer printing method sublimation actually adds no\nadditional layer of paper on top of the fabric and you\ncan't feel the difference of the printed image and the rest of the\nfabric okay now that we've covered what these two methods actually are\nlet's go into some key differences and considerations between these two methods\nthe first topic that we're going to cover between these two methods is\ndurability and feel as i briefly mentioned before sublimation does not\nadd an extra layer on top of your fabric versus a two-step heat transfer printing\nmethod actually leaves a thin layer on top of your fabric\nso the feel is going to be much different so right off the bat you will\nfeel a difference between the printed design using these two\nmethods now in terms of durability with a heat transfer printed design\nit can last about 30 to 40 washes depending on how large your design is\nand how it's actually being washed now on the other hand with sublimation\nbecause the ink or the toner is actually infused inside the fabric and becomes a\npart of the fabric it is a much more permanent design onto\nthe fabric and it can withstand a lot more washes\nin fact most sublimated designs will last just as\nlong as the actual fabric itself because\nyou're not leaving an extra layer of transfer on top of the fabric\nyou're not going to see any cracking after washes and the image is much\nless likely to fade with sublimation so in this category of durability and feel\nit is pretty clear that sublimation wins out in this category because\nit can last a lot longer and you don't feel the actual transfer\nimage on top of the garment alright the second item to consider\nbetween sublimation printing and heat transfer printing\nis the variety of substrates that you can transfer images onto\nwith sublimation printing you are much more limited in\nthe variety of substrates that you can transfer images onto this is because\nsublimation can only adhere to polyester coated materials\neven if you use something that is 60 polyester\nand 40 cotton which is really about the minimum amount of polyester\nthat you need in order to make sublimation work in that 60 40\npoly cotton blend you're not going to get as much vibrancy\nin your transfer design versus 100 polyester\nwith sublimation you also have to use only\nwhite colored substrates or very light colored substrates that means you can't\nuse sublimation on a black t-shirt or a dark mug\nbecause the actual design won't show on the other hand\nwith white toner heat transfer printing you can actually print on light\nand dark colored garments and you're not limited to anything with polyester only\nin fact with heat transfer printing you can heat transfer onto\ncotton onto polyester even ceramic and other hard surfaces like wood and\nmetal and therefore in this category of variety of substrates you can\ntransfer onto heat transfer definitely wins out in\nthis one because of the variety of things that you can do finally let's\ngo into the category of the quality of the colors you can print\nusing these two methods first off sublimation allows you to print full\ncolors and this can be super helpful when\ntrying to sublimate a photo for example or doing a particular job for a customer\nthat requires a very specific color such as one for a company logo you can\nalso achieve sharp vibrant designs using heat\ntransfer paper if you're printing your design\nusing a white toner transfer system such as the ricoma r550 so it really is a\nvirtual tie in this category between sublimation and\nheat transfer printing because you can achieve\nfull color vibrant designs with either method the real difference lies\nin the durability and the feel of either method\nalso the variety of substrates that you can transfer onto but fortunately you\ncan achieve the best of both worlds using a white toner transfer printing\nsystem such as the one that we have here at ricoma the ricoma r550\ni kind of alluded to this briefly in the beginning of the episode\nin that you can achieve sublimation and heat transfer using heat transfer paper\nwith the ricoma r550 and that's because you can actually swap out\none of the toner cartridges in the r550 with a specialty sublimation\ntoner cartridge so in conclusion guys both printing methods\ninvolve a similar process but yield very different results\nhowever in sublimation printing the ink or toner actually permeates\nthroughout the fabric and becomes part of the fabric itself in\ntwo-step heat transfer printing on the other hand the image simply becomes\nanother layer on top of the substrate thankfully the\nricoma r550 white toner transfer printing system\ncan achieve either method simply by swapping out\nthe toner cartridge so make sure you keep these considerations in mind\nwhen deciding which method to use to fulfill the needs of your customers\nat the end of the day it really depends on what your customer is looking for the\ntype of material they're looking to get printed on and that will drive your\ndecision on what is best for your customers\nlike i mentioned before if you're looking to get started in the heat\ntransfer printing business or you're looking to add on

you", "lgzpQulFVOE": "t-shirts are always one of the main things I feel like we're all looking to buy because there's so many different brands out there there's so much different quality out there and finding good quality basic street wear shirts and obviously sometimes pretty different personally I love to avoid all the cheap kind of brands out there and I like to buy a little bit more premium quality when it comes to stuff like shirts so today's video I want to talk about one of the new brands I've found in terms of basic clothing and that is reporter and today we're gonna be talking about all about reporter t-shirts up without saying too much more let's get into it what's up guys if you're new here my name is Matt I make a ton of videos like this on YouTube twice a week usually if you're new here I suggest subscribing them below it is definitely a growing community and I appreciate all the support I get in every video so let's talk about reporter who is reporter well reporter is a wholesale like dirt hoodie sweatshirt sweat pant company and they really try to capitalize on people who are looking for very basic clothing but a more premium quality so today we're gonna talk to my t-shirt I picked up three of them in my left hand which would be on your right side was gonna be a black I'm currently wearing their vintage wash shirt and on my right your left will be the white t-shirt so something interesting to note about with all these shirts is that they're all made in Portugal there's different levels of cotton that they use all three of the ones I'm wearing right now are more of their like ultra luxury ones which in my opinion are just heavier t-shirts I actually did order two white ones that were supposed to be one in the regular original version and one of the luxury cotton version but they ran out of the white one in my size and the reason why I wanted two of those is really because of how I've been wearing my shirts and stuff lately is I've been wearing stuff like this under like a sweatshirt or something that's what kind of piece of the bottom and picks out a little bit at the top but honestly the guys over at reporters or customer service can reach out to me and actually texted me saying hey like we'll give you an upgrade to the ultra version because it ran out and in my opinion I need to mention that because you don't get that all the time and most people would have just canceled the order they wouldn't even let you know they would just strip just cancel if you get one shirt and be curious on why so for them to reach out honestly I thought was worth mentioning it lets me know what the customer service team cares lets me know the Britain cares about the customer more than it cares about like three dollars in profit and I'm hoping that I can help them of the three dollars of loss and profit for me can go ahead and go back into other people buying their stuff and know this isn't a sponsor post didn't get any of these products to free I just got like the ultra version of this one at a slightly discounted rate but not on purpose so getting it to the actual quality of the shirt some stuff I'm talking about everything else but the shirt quality honestly these are extremely good quality shirts they're very thick they feel way better than gilding they feel way better than American Apparel in my opinion iOS a that they feel better than some of the LA apparel they're better than pretty much any other quality shirt that's like a wholesale division that I felt personally I'd say these are closer to what you will find in an essentials t-shirt than what you will find with the minimal ones and even I'm going on record and saying I actually love the quality of this so much better than the essentials teachers and I think the main differences between these reporter shirts and essentials are kind of twofold one is that these have virtually no branding on these like literally is no branding because you're supposed to put your own branding on this is supposed to be for like a brand to buy but if you look there's literally no tag here at all it's just my size tag which I about these all and a medium i think the other difference between this and an essentials teacher would be that the neck collar is a little bit higher up it is more like kind of reaching more mock neck territory when it comes to kind of how its spinning this is the only thing that i don't really care for on this i wish it was a little bit lower because like my collarbone is down here and it is like way up here you can probably even see that i have like a tan this is where I normally have my t-shirts and it's a lot higher than that something to keep in mind for for summer because if you can have a tan you really don't want this a shirt on at that point cousin you have a tan up here and any heavy either tan down here something to keep in mind now in terms of sizing I went down the size I normally wear a large and all my shirts it's my true to size size I went down to medium just based off their size guide fact I didn't really want arm links that went down past my elbow and for me these fit perfectly how I wanted it to I didn't want super oversize but I did want it more of a drop shoulder relaxed fit and for me personally this fits the cut and with sizing on this for me personally I went down size you can go true to size and I've definitely seen it work the guy that really pushed my hand to buying this was on the Facebook group so looked at someone honey I think is like Luciano and hopefully I'll have like some type of photo up of his Instagram page but he was really the person I saw and he went true to size with his shirts I went down a size and I personally feel like that fits better for how I like my clothing and not looking super duper big and stuff but just looking just right for me I honestly think with this vintage wash I think that could have been a little bit better of a wash with it pairing it to this locusts and wild honey t-shirt that I bought from Paul funny fella when he dropped it this is a vintage watch shirt through and through a little bit softer feel to it I would say that the wash on the t-shirt is night and day you can pretty much see the difference like this is more like a wash black this is in my opinion a vintage wash but then again this could wash down where the wall I haven't put these in the washing machine yet although I do plan on putting this one in the washing machine soon sure suit I can't frickin talk today and just kind of see how that turns out be really interesting to see if I can turn it more into this vintage style look that's kind of why I bought it rather than just like kind of washed black we're just gonna looks like a dark grey in a way I think the only improvements that could be made to this shirt to make it perfect for me personally so just definitely differs from person to person I'll be lowering the neck a little bit probably like an inch down it'd be a little bit more of a normal like look to it but still being able to peek out a little bit under like a sweatshirt or things like that and for me I don't really care for super long what's called sleeves on stuff I like a little bit shorter so having it like in the middle of where your arm and meet with still drop shoulder I think would look really good but being in the minority there but just something that personal preference for all this everybody has their own preferences from me something like that I think it would be my everyday wear for t-shirts I do plan on checking out their hoodies and sweatpants once we drop more the vintage II wash stuff and I'll be giving my thoughts on them in a video once that comes along but overall from what I've seen in the Facebook group with other people talking definitely worth the money you definitely have racer prices a little bit to be very worried about that if you're looking for best quality street wear blanks that you can basically buy a better quality t-shirt for pretty low prices made in Portugal using very high quality Cotton's I would say that reporter is our best bet and I would say they are someone that you should starting to buy from and if all else fails you spend $25 that $30 on a t-shirt and if you don't like you don't like it I guarantee you you spent more on t-shirts that don't fit you well and if all spills can wear it to that there's no branding on them I don't really know it's ink go buy one for yourself I'll leave a link to them down in the description below and well if you want to start a brand with these go ahead you're probably the best feeling t-shirts on the market for like branding with your own screen print on them and that has been today's video about reporter let me know you gets to give them in the comments below if you have any thoughts or different opinions leave them below I would love to hear them and I think would help other people with their purchases and if you want to I would suggest subscribing below really helps out a small youtube channel like myself and worry I'll leave a like on the video to let me know that you guys liked it and want to see more videos like this on my channel and again with all this craziness going around and me being stuck at home for days upon days you just want to say thank you guys so much for watching this video and have a great rest of your day week month and I'll see you in the next video peace", "D7FqwkG8I10": "what's up guys Lucia Lumina here and in today's video I am going to be sublimating on three different types of shirts so today I have the Cricut and fusible ink t-shirts that they sell at Michaels and you probably can find these Michaels certain Walmart's Hobby Lobby Joanne's all those type of hobby or craft shops and these guys are 95% polyester and 5% I believe nylon or something like diet or spandex 5% spandex and cricket markets this as its infusible inc brand I'll see the camera can kind of focus on that right there but really they sell like their own patterns and be able to cut it with the Cricut and kind of you know print similar to what this guy has well lucky for us we have an actual sublimation printer that will print whatever we want on this guy so the other two type of shirts I was trying to find a 50/50 poly cotton but I couldn't find one anymore like locally so I ended up grabbing a to Walmart shirts but their one was is for women and one for men and one of them is a time and true brand you can see think that sir the woman brand that they have and this guy is and I'll show you guys here it is a 60% cotton and 40% recycled polyester and you guys can see the tag there so you see it so we're gonna be using this guy we're gonna see how a subliminal print comes out on this and then I also got a George brand I say and and this is actually shirts that I use very often with HCV and and heat transfers I actually like the George Brown how the shirts kind of feel and they're very easy to access at least during the summer and spring times and even fall a winter you kind of see this long-sleeve version of these t-shirts but for the most part they're pretty easy to find and this guy is 65% polyester and 35% cotton you can kind of see so we have three different levels of polyester in the shirt and while I kind of know you know I think the minimum should be 50/50 poly cotton this one probably would work this is just kind of my I guess assumptions or or my theory I don't think this one's gonna do too well but this one for sure should sublimate very very good and I actually found these for sale at Michaels 50% off so if you guys actually follow me on my Instagram at Lumina creative I typically post about cells like this so these guys like I said were 50% off so $10 typically at Michaels they were 5 bucks guys is this cheaper than what I can get them like on some t-shirt websites I can be trying to get a hundred percent polyester so it was a really good deal I picked up a bunch of these because I have a huge order and then like I said follow my Instagram and I always pull stuff like this so yeah guys I am gonna get my designer here real quick I'm not really gonna show that if you want to see the process of doing that you can watch my previous video up here that kind of shows you the introduction of sublimation how I set up a image of that nature but I'm gonna go ahead and set up the image and then I'm gonna go ahead and print it and I'm gonna get the heat press ready I guess for so far the settings on the heat press you're gonna do 400 degrees Fahrenheit so if your machine is in Celsius like mine that's gonna be 200 and 204 degrees I definitely recommend having a little legs are going to kind of check the temperature of your heat press at all times because mine is a little off sometimes and you're gonna set your timer at 45 to 60 seconds try to play with the timer typically black ink if your image has a lot of black ink that takes a little bit longer to sublimate as simply the last color that kind of transfers over and again guys if you guys are only a little more about sublimation of the process check out that video I did a few weeks ago but anyways let me go ahead and get to it I'm gonna print and then we'll switch over to the camera over here on the heat press alright guys so I just ran my test print I always suggest you guys to run with your sublimation printer in case you don't use it on the daily like I do like I said I'm more of a few chunks of plaster so heat transfer user and HCV and so I just kind of ran one real quick it's kinda what the delenn's gonna be similar to the one I do with the Neenah 3G opaque when I did a print and cut except I added my domain at the bottom so we're gonna sublimate this guy this is just a regular eight and a half by eleven sheet guys so I'm gonna go ahead and start running the actual one and let's see how it comes out guys I cannot stress this enough I printed these guys wrong so what sublimation always always always always remember mirror your image I just wasted a bunch of ink on three prints that were supposed to be reversed learn from my mistakes guys I got a reprint them let's go alright guys so we are back so I already kind of pre-press this one right here now you're supposed to put something in here and I don't know where 1/2 will happen to my little board I like a little plastic thing that I put underneath so I'm gonna slide our old of use quick and Matt underneath here and just because I don't have my actual thing that I use but I guess this works too right and what this is guys is with sublimation sometimes the the transfer will go a little bit too far or like the it'll go through so you can do this so that that doesn't happen to you this shirts a v-neck so I'm gonna put it up a little higher so this first shirt is the time ensure I'm so sorry the lighting sucks I'm not this is not I intended to do Hey oh cool so one of the transfers now it is a mirrored rookie mistakes guys I'm not gonna measure I'm not gonna try to get this perfect this is literally just to see if it'll sublimate on to the shirt just want to see if it'll work these are just test prints so we're gonna go ahead and press those guys let's see how this goes I guess we're gonna take this one off I'm not gonna show you how everything looks till the end so ye alrighty guys we're gonna go ahead and put the next shirt in which is the George brand and this one is 6535 so we're gonna go ahead and put this guy on [Music] that we transfer same thing guys same process and you'll put it on here slap this narek there you know we're gonna go to town I think that's pretty close to being Center so yeah sorry guys so same thing lift up don't breathe in remember you're supposed to be doing this in a regulated area alrighty guys so last shirt gonna throw on the and this is the cricket one notice every shirt gets bigger and bigger I start from small medium and now extra-large these old cricket Matt's work just fine for this but they do kind of melt so you got to wait a little bit before you take them out and it'll harden up again and take shape so anyways you're gonna impress these get the wrinkles out and the moisture I'm gonna go ahead and do the last print guys Center that like so [Music] again I'm not doing this 100% accurate I'm just kind of eyeballing to see the quality of these prints not necessarily use these shirts for anything [Music] same think I'm breathe alright guys so I know it looks like anyone from day to night I kind of started this little delayed afternoon where there's a little bit of sunlight it's kind of gone down her those prints took a little while to do especially because I could do it twice because my dumb self decided to do them not mirrored again guys learn from my mistakes and I am not ashamed to show you that I to make these type of mistakes three perfectly good sublimation sheets gone to waste including ink don't be like me just see you see these are the ones I used they are mirrored so to you look straight to me here on the camera whether they have been all used and let's see the final results guys I just don't want you guys to see that not because something shouldn't be done doesn't mean just because some people say it shouldn't be done doesn't mean you can't do it there's a bunch of different ways to do things and and you know what guys every customer is different you might get a customer that wants the least expensive route that wants to just as long as the image is somewhat visible they don't care and you know for those type of customers one of these options are going to be great for the customers I want the higher end stuff one of these options is gonna be good too and so like I tell people that comment on my videos because I do get some people are like I bet you if you watch that nina 3g up a paper is gonna fall right off or I bit because it's not pigment in ink it's gonna fall right off after water too and you know what guys I get it it's hard to believe it when you don't do it yourself but if you follow some of these instructions that I'm giving you step-by-step you're gonna get the same results I do and you know the this is stuff that people say shouldn't work on and so I'm gonna show you guys the three results from three sharps and you tell me what you think and which route would you go through would you go for would you offer all these three to your customers we're joining off for one comment in the section below and tell me what are your thoughts so anyways let me grab these shirts so you can kind of take a look already so we're gonna start with the shirt that I thought just wasn't gonna sublimate and that's the time and true brand from Walmart and the reason why I use these specifically showed you guys is because you can go purchase these at your local stores this is not something you have to order from someone these shirts are not something that you have to go find in the internet it's literally available to anybody and at ridiculous prices so this time and shoe came in and think I had four dollars for a shirt and guys honestly if you don't have an account somewhere or like a wholesale account that's a pretty good fish good price for a shirt especially something you can sublimate on so this is the type of shoe brand guys and I'll see if I can ladies all out at the end and you know comparison like I actually do like a panning of them but this is what that shirt looks like and again this was if I am correct 65% cotton about 60% pima cotton and a forty percent recycled polyester so I mean here I know the camera is a little difficult to see but it's definitely a little a little faded type of look it's not it's not a super super sharp image but it works guys some people might have customers that don't mind this you know and this is why you have a few samples laying around will show your your customers and you know for somebody's gonna get these dirty and they're just you know for advanced or for something that's like a one-off use why not why am i go with the least expensive option so anyways let's switch over to the George brand and I try to do a female and a male brand so that's like yeah yeah you know I can't find it for one the other Bailey's this is the George Brown guys right here and this is 65% polyester 35% cotton a little more vibrant you can definitely see a little more details in the print looks good like I said Walmart Walmart Walmart Walmart Walmart I like most of my shirts that I saw the people at one work I use Gildan Walmart and then I want to go to step up like a little bit better quality I go to next level or Bella canvas which Bella canvas is actually now available at michaels if you don't have a whole slit account alright so last shirt okay and this is the cricut brand and fusible ink and I got these guys on sale I got that for style Michaels and they do go I'm sorry once in a blue moon and these these are typically $10 a piece which is a little more expensive than the order from a website or something typically the polyester 100% of like seven dollars or maybe a little less I know you guys probably some of you guys probably have a better host account than I do but for me it's seven dollars for polyester shirt and I found these guys for five bucks guys so I actually bought almost a whole inventory because I had a very large order fulfill but this is how the Cricut this is 95% polyester and 5% spandex guys it is so vibrant like it is sharp it is clean check that out it is a very nice quality image very little bleeding you can specifically tell in the text very little bleeding very clean image and this might be for those customers that don't mind spending a little bit extra you go with the 95% cotton again you can probably find this stuff cheaper online guys but I'm trying to give you a solution to be able to do this stuff from home and if you get like a random customer that pops up and you need a quote quick and they need something turnaround for next day either way you're gonna charge them a premium this is the cost you gotta pay they gotta pay in store prices if not they can wait like everybody else and you can order and get your discounted rates okay so this is what it looks like after a wash and this is the more cotton one the yeah the tiny children and so she watched this one time already so I'm kind of trying to get a little close a little bit looks a little bit like that worn effect but guys like I said it looks good and I printed well the heat didn't fall off you know obviously I don't know we might give it a few more wash tests and see what they come out like the cricket one looks awesome we washed all three of them together and this is the cricket one pretty much the same nice and vibrant looks great so tell ten guys thank you so much guys for tuning in don't forget to tune in for my lives on Mondays at 7

back to my channel today i am going to show you all how i created the silk looking sublimation on the cotton and this is what you're going to need you're going to need you some satin material some heat and bond ultra hold make sure you get the ultra hold a lint roller some scissors your cotton t-shirt and your image and i'm going to be doing a kids t-shirt fortnite for my nephew his birthday is coming up he's going to be having a four night party so i'm going to make this one for him so first you want to do is take your satin material on the shiny side and go ahead and do your sublimation on top of it you're going to do it as you would do any regular sublimation you want to heat press this for 60 seconds at 400. there we go so [Music] we are waiting for that we are going to go ahead and get our length roller and remove everything from our t-shirt that static material once you cut it it does stretch straight like some strings so it's going to get all over the place all over your t-shirt but not like so bad that you can't deal with it so just remove it from your shirt and wait for that look just about almost all of the ink came out of this paper i'm trying to remove this tape here but there you go there's your image on the satin material that's how you get that shiny look then you're going to go ahead and take this material and flip it over and then you're going to take your [Applause] heat and bond and place it on the back you want to cut this down and make it a little bigger than your image but not too much bigger you can also cut down make sure you cut your static material a little bit bigger than your your image as well so you don't waste that much material and then i'm going to go ahead and heat press this onto my setting so again this is the back side and you have to actually work a little fast but not too fast with this because once this get under the heat it automatically starts to melt and stick so you want to place your material in your heating bar it has a rough side well shiny side and then it has a paper side this paper side is going to be facing upwards the rough shiny side is the adhesive so you're going to make sure that part is laying flat on your material and this paper side is facing upwards and then lay that on top of there and press that for about a few seconds not long at all so it's like make sure it fits real quick like that then once you have your image on there you're going to go ahead and cut it to size now i did not cut this out straight but [Music] so once you have your image cut to size you're going to go ahead and remove the paper from the back and that's your double-sided adhesive that's why you don't want to press it for too long just quick real quick just to stick it because if you press too long your temperature is hot like it is at 400 for 60 seconds which is too hot you will melt the adhesive it will seep through to your image and then the back adhesive will also melt and your paper will stick to it you won't be able to get it off so make sure you doesn't you don't press too long in the temp if the temperature is high like mine right now because i did the sublimation 460 you just want to close it pop it back up so here's the image remove the paper so that's the back adhesive and you're going to place that on your t-shirt now this once you press this my temperature is too hot right now so same thing just close it and open it [Music] and there you go sublimation on dark colors and cotton at that still soft smooth feels real good nice shiny dope looking nice now if you do this on a white shirt the colors are going to be a lot brighter it's going to be darker on a dark color shirt because it has a dark background but on the light color shirts it's much brighter than this but either way it's still dope no matter what kids is going to love this adult's going to love it it's just dope i'm using vvi and i will put the link in the description box so you can go ahead and support my small business and i will also be carrying vinyl soon different type of vinyl especially pattern vinyl look at this here dope glitter pattern vinyl regular glitter vinyl all colors metallic pattern vinyl and this is um actually not regular vinyl this is htv so these are all heat transfer vinyl and then your typical normal htv here so with this glitter htv that i'm going to be having on my website soon is going to be different patterns it's already pressed on top of glitter and it also comes with the transfer sheets for this one and also for the pattern htv and i'm gonna have multiple patterns multiple colors that's coming soon so stay tuned to that but like i said once i get to 1000 subscribers five of my subscribers will be winning a set of my ink sublimation ink so please make sure you subscribe like subscribe share and see you guys soon", "gVLwysH4654": "[Music] okay so these are the designs that i'm going to be doing i'm going to bleach this one first and then as you can see i've already sublimated this one and then this is the other design i'm going to be doing it's already sublimated and i'm going to do this one the bleaching first so i'll show you what they look like [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so as you can see these shirts have now been bleached these are the ones that i subbed first they've been washed and dried and this is how they've turned out so now we're gonna go ahead and press these that i bleached first so we're going to come over here to the heat dress lay it on here digestion and this is another thing that i didn't go over but when you're bleaching first you're going to want to use the butcher paper or parchment paper and you want to use a new sheet every single time because once i pull this off after this has been pressed the design is going to kind of be inky onto this and if you go to use it again it's going to mess up another shirt so okay so we're going to process it 400 degrees for 60 seconds [Applause] when this is done i'm going to spray the shirt with peroxide you're going to be able to see the scorch marks so it's gonna be it's not as bad on the blue shirts but there will be a little bit of um browning around the image so we're gonna spray that and it will take away those marks we've got our design okay and like i said this one you're not going to see the brown marks as much and then this is a spray bottle that i use this is 100 peroxide i don't add water or nothing to it and um we're going to mist this not get it soaked just mist it like this just kind of go over any spots that you think might need it a little bit more and you can either just sit it under here like this for a few minutes or you could take this shirt like this and sit it but you don't want to leave it like this too long because i've had a couple times where it's had a burn line right there so we're just going to let it sit and that's it okay so here's the two side by side as you can tell this one's a lot more faded than this one is um but i might throw this one into the washer and then show you guys how it looks afterwards just to show you that it's not going to fade and look like this it will stay really pigmented how it looks here all right so now we're going to do the red one so we can do a comparison on that we're going to put the design on here like i said new piece of paper over top every time [Music] and as you can tell i don't know if you're able to see it on the camera but this does have that previous design kind of inked on to it so that's why i'm saying don't keep keep using the same piece of paper because the shirt's white where you're placing it and it'll get ink all over that white area and you don't want to do that because you're not going to be able to get it off all right and now we're going to spray with peroxide like i said we're just lightly misting over the design we don't want to soak it and then let it sit under there until it dries [Music] you", "y7yTUzG3cII": "\u200bToday we are talking about the American\nApparel Ladies Fine Jersey, 100% Ring Spun Cotton T-Shirt. \u200bNow this is the t-shirt that started the entire soft t-shirt revolution. With it's\n100% ring spun fine jersey material, super fine thread count, this is a t-shirt that\nyou are going love. Now, we love this because 1, it also comes in a uni-sex model, so if\nyou are ordering for a large group, it means that you can get the same colors for uni-sex\nand ladies. Now instead of just talking though about how it fits and everything, we are going\nto have our model come over and I can actually show you how this looks.\n\u200bFirst thing you are going to notice is, basically it does have this tailored side\nseam here. It is going to fit great, it's going to look like it actually was made for\nyour body. The uni-sex version is going to be more straight down. Because of this side\nseam, it's going to naturally hug your curves. The other thing is, these sleeves. They are\nnot capped by any means, sometimes capped sleeves for ladies are a lot higher and kind\nof just hug the shoulder area here. These are full length, but not too long. These are\nactually flattering, we like that. \u200bThe neck line here is a very standard neck\nline. If you are looking for a looser neck line, the Bella option, or even like a Next\nLevel, they offer other necks that are a little looser. The American Apparel's a pretty standard one, pretty high up, in the 100% ring spun cotton. \u200bWe have talked a lot about 100% ring spun\ncotton, which makes some people, you kind of get this \"Question Mark\". What about shrinkage,\nor what should I be thinking about for sizing. With this, we kind of recommend ordering one\nsize up in the 100% ring spun version. The 50/50 and the 50/25/25 version by American\nApparel, no worries there, but the 100% ring spun, just because it doesn't stretch as much\nwith polyester in it or rayon. It means that, you know what, it's not going to move it the\nsame way. We recommend one size up. You can always check our sizing charts before you\norder, but that's one of our recommendations. \u200bMaia, what do you think of this?\nMaia: \"\u200bWell, you know I like it because it is that classic crew neck style. It's easy, it's just your go-to T, but it also still has a feminine enough fit, because of that side seam.\" Yeah. It does come in a crazy amount of colors.\nIf you are looking for some odd ball color, this shirt is the one that's actually going\nto offer that to you. If you have a company with some crazy color, check it out, this\nshirt probably has something that's close to your company logo.\n\u200bThanks so much, this is awesome. You look great in that.\nMaia:\u200b\"Thanks. Thank you.\" On the Coed Monkey Soft Scale, we rate this\nt-shirt a 2. \u200bThanks for watching this video. Please\nlet us know if you have any questions, because here at Coed Monkey, soft matters and so\ndo our customers.", "6zyzbekqjgE": "what's up guys it's koi from gentlemen within and in this video

back on my essential style series so I'm gonna link that up there for you guys and down in the description below so you know sometimes it's a struggle to find the perfect fit especially as a shorter guy definitely it's a hard time to find the perfect fit and of course there are other great t-shirt brands out there but these are the five t-shirt brands that have been working for me and surprisingly four out of the five brands on this list can be found in shopping malls all across the country and so without further ado my top five I buy best fitting t-shirt brands for men I'm also gonna have links down in the description below to all of the t-shirts that I talk about in this video first up on the list of best fitting t-shirt brands for men is Uniqlo this mega fashion retailer is known worldwide for their affordable quality and timeless basics it's become one of my favorite places to shop and being a shorter guy five six their clothes fit extremely well they also offer in-store hemming for their pants which is super clutch a service no other major retailers offer it's no surprise that their t-shirts are the best bang for your buck out there coming in at under $10 you can pick up a supima cotton crew or v-neck shirt that fits impeccably I once heard that Uniqlo was discontinuing these shirts but I guess customer demand didn't allow for that regardless the 100% cotton shirts are great for the price although there are better suit Pino cotton options out there in terms of fabric quality the shirt is a size extra small 100% cotton and at a price of 9 the bottom line when it comes to fit and price no other brand tops Uniqlo in my opinion number two on the list of best fitting t-shirts for men is Armani Exchange I can honestly say that I haven't shopped at Armani Exchange in about a decade since surprisingly that's when I got these two shirts that are featured in this video I think it was around high school that I was getting into men's fashion and dressing more stylish Li and so our money exchange was where all the cool kids shopped they were known for their clean graphic tees and from my experience flawless fit at least when it came to their tees Armani exchanged t-shirt quality are some of the best around especially their pima cotton variety I've learned this green graphic tee for over 10 years and has been through hundreds of wash and dry cycles although it may be nearing its end I'm holding onto it because it's been a staple in my wardrobe for so long and it's one of the few graphic tees that I still wear the fit and quality is what stands out to me the shirt has kept its shape and is still one of the softest cotton fabric shirts that I own as for the shirt size it's an extra small 100% supima cotton the bottom line when it comes to quality soft pima cotton tees ax can't be be number three on my list of best fitting t-shirt brands for men is Banana Republic and Republic is another major retailer that can be found in nearly every shopping mall across the country known for their stylish slightly more expensive business and smart casual wear Banana Republic continues to offer quality well fitting clothes for men of all Heights they're the top of the Gap Old Navy totem pole as well I've shopped regularly epinet a republic for decades now they used to have trendy items but usually you can find timeless staples for every modern day gentleman the bottom line Banana Republic tees although a bit pricier not by much have some of the best fits out there for skinnier guys at muscular alike as for the shirt size it's an extra-small 100% supima cotton number four on my list of best fitting t-shirt brands for men is Express so Express was definitely my gateway into the whole menswear game at least when it came to dressing better I remember my first time walking to Express around middle school or high school and seeing all the fancy clothes you know I thought how was a true balls player every time I when to express and made a purchase that's forward to today and I can't even remember the last time I stepped foot into an express store that's for the shirts they fit a bit snug almost as if it's an undershirt without the moisture wicking fabric they've got plenty of stretch if that's your thing and if you've got the physique and want to show off those gains then Express slim fit shirts are perfect for you they hug your body in all of the right places accentuating all of your glamour muscles back tries buys and even abs and so this shirt is the size extra small stretch it's 57 percent cotton 38% polyester and 5% spandex the bottom line these Express tees have the best stretch and look really good especially if you have a chest and guns last but not least number five on this list of best fitting t-shirt brands for men is sharp casual wear so this is the only one on the list caters specifically for shorter men and it's also a brand that you cannot find anywhere in stores and only online so if you're a short guy then this brand should be on your radar they offer American design and made casual basics for men of modest height five eight and under you can find Jersey merino Raglan and tensile knits in their collection all quality great fitting shirts as for this year it is a size medium not as small or an extra small just because as I said before they cater to shorter guys so it is a size medium trim fit made of 66 percent rayon from bamboo 28 percent cotton and 6% spandex for that extra stretch the bottom line if you're a shorter guy five eight and under sharp casual wear is worth taking a look at they're designed and made in San Francisco quality stuff alright so that concludes this video thank you as always for watching if you liked the video please give

style and I will catch you on the next one peace [Music] you [Music]", "ty0VTAZHG1E": "hey it's state will save custom t-shirts and team jerseys coming at you from Burlington Ontario Canada today we're doing a product review of the Gildan ultra cotton t-shirt what can I tell you about the Gildan ultra cotton well first of all Gildan is the world leader in the promotional t-shirt business this is their standard the industry standard for the promotional t-shirt we sell more of these t-shirts than any other t-shirt out there and you can pause the video right here if you want to take a second and look at the features of the shirt so before we get into the details of the shirt I'll tell you a little bit about the manufacturing process Gildan these ultra Cotton's are actually manufactured down in the dominican the dominican is actually one of the happiest countries in the world strangely enough it's a developing nation where your average person down there makes about 10 bucks 10 US dollars per day and about 50% of the country lives in poverty so the t-shirt is a 100% preshrunk jersey knit cotton it's actually one of the heavier t-shirts that you can buy in terms of the fabric weight why is fabric weight important because fabric weight impacts the wearability of the shirt it's really a matter of personal preference personally I like to wear shirts that are a little bit lighter in the fabric Department probably somewhere around the 6 to 7 range and if you kind of benchmark this against one of the more you know entry-level fashionable t-shirts like an American Apparel these are about 33% heavier in terms of the fabric versus the American Apparel so regarding the print ability of these t-shirts as I mentioned earlier these t-shirts really have a tendency to top up a lot of ink so what you want to try to avoid is you want to try to avoid putting massive full-color logos on these shirts because it will absorb up a lot of the ink and that image on the front of your shirt will like be having a thick coat of paint on the front of your shirt which will allow the shirt to breed or anything like that like for example the guy over on the left side of the screen right here he's got a really Inc intensive logo on a shirt where is the guy more in the middle has a better shirt because that logo is just strictly text it doesn't absorb up as much ink and it makes the shirt a little bit nicer away so the ultra cotton and its complementary shirts come in you know the manager of the unisex size plus there's lady sizes and there's youth and children's sizes as well plus it comes in a variety of style you can not only get a t-shirt breaking in a long-sleeve shirt you can get a pullover hoodie and you can get a zip up hoodie the reason why this is important to you as a consumer is because if you've got a wide variety of people or you're trying to launch a whole garment line you've got a wide variety of products to choose from with very well matching colors one other thing is that Gildan does an awesome job on making sure that their colors are consistent throughout the product line so if you get a navy blue shirt navy blue t-shirt the same pretty much the identical coloring the identical fabric dye is going to be used on their hoodies and their ladies t-shirts and their long sweeps so it makes color matching your products and coming out with a nice consistent theme across the board really easy to do overall we've given the Gildan ultra cotton a rating of 3 of 5 stars everyone's already familiar with the Gildan brand name so it's a nice easy shirt brand is recognizable folks think they're getting a great quality shirt when they get these so dollar for dollar I think if you spent a little bit more money you can get a you know much better quality shirt and have a much wider range of printing options on that shirt thanks for watching our review of the Gildan ultra cotton t-shirt if you need custom printed t-shirts or team jerseys you can reach us at WWF CA we'll talk to you soon", "TyoU3mKwd6g": "over the last three months I only wore three shirts this one from Patagonia that I bought for $50 this one from ever lane that I bought for 30 and this one that I bought from Walmart for a whopping $6 in this video we're gonna figure out whether or not they're worth the money that I bought them for hey team welcome back to another Levi's save the world Hildebrand episode the channel where we prove that you don't need to be a hero to save the planet today I'm going to be comparing a Patagonia ever lain and Jorge t-shirt to see if the price that you pay for a t-shirt actually impacts the quality of the product itself this video is a part of a series where I do challenges and experiments to test out sustainability practices in real life I boycotted Black Friday and Cyber Monday I only ate uber eats for two entire weeks and most recently I documented my experience living without a car in North America for an entire year this video like all of those other videos is brought to you by my patreon supporters on patreon I post exclusive behind-the-scenes updates on these challenge videos and everything else that I'm working on in addition to that you get to see a secret podcast that I release every single month where I talk about sustainability stories in the news and my own personal journey here on this channel trying to reduce my environmental impact so if you're interested in any of that or you just want to support this channel head down to the description to check it out for yourself but here in this video we are going to be breaking down my experience only wearing three shirts for 90 days every single day for 90 days straight so right off the top I have to acknowledge that this is not a mathematical experiment in any sort of way but I did take some measures to try and keep this as fair as possible all of the shirts that I'm comparing are made of a hundred percent cotton they were all made outside of North America and all of these shirts were worn and washed the exact same number of times see I even kept this tally my phone I wore them all in pretty similar conditions from riding my bike around town working out to working all day sitting at a computer I watched them in full loads of laundry and dried them in an open-air drying rack upstairs but one quick note about washing probably a whole bunch of you just thought to yourselves wait 30 wears and 5 washes that means Levi's Wars shirt like 9 times without washing it and I would say that you're wrong because 30 divided by 5 is 6 but the point is yeah I don't wash my clothes very often because you really don't have to in fact I bought that pair of jeans right there 4 months ago and I still haven't watched them yet [Laughter] Leah you love this stuff way too much the reality is washing your clothes is one of the fastest ways to wear them out these three t-shirts would have been in way worse condition if I was washing them with warm water and drying them in a drying machine rant summary you probably don't need to be washing your clothes as often as you are save the planet your wallet and your clothes by just washing with cold water and air drying but anyways let's go s see what happened for the final evaluation of these shirts I based it off of three very random criteria that I invented for the purpose of this video number one is fit does this shirt actually fit me the way that I wanted it to when I bought it in the first place and does it look bad generally number two is wear and tear does the fabric itself seem to have broken down at all as appealing as it stretched out etc and number three is cost does it seem to be worth the money that I spent on the shirt after 30 days of using it well let's start with the most expensive so full disclosure for the sake of this video I love Patagonia I think that they're an incredible company I made a whole video about them and what they do in a video a couple years back when I look like I actually worked for them I'm probably not going to grow my hair it again if that's a word for some people so don't unsubscribe just based on that alone the fit of this shirt has honestly been one of my favorites of the three begin with I know that this is very different and very subjective because every shirt fits every person differently but this cut just seems to really work for my body type wear and tear this shirt has held up extremely well once you get a really nice close-up on the fabric itself you can see that it has been used but the material has retained its shape and retained its fabric integrity really really well for the most part this shirt looks pretty well the same as when I got it 30 warez ago now in terms of cost for me the Patagonia was a very expensive shirt fifty dollars for a t-shirt that's just cotton in today's world seems crazy because that's often ten times the price of what you can get a similar looking gray t-shirt for but this has held up extremely well for that dollar value part of the reason why this shirt is so expensive is because Patagonia is a leader in socially an environmentally responsible fashion but we're gonna get into that later in the video let's move on to ever lane now full disclosure I made a video debunking ever lanes claims to be radically transparent but they are a higher-end brand and therefore they should in theory have a higher quality product fit and feel honestly I love the fit of this shirt as well it's been always quite nice and tight and slimming the only thing that's slightly different from the Patagonia is the fact that it feels like a lighter shirt the material seems to be I don't know how else to put it a lighter it feels like there's less shirt on me right now and that's not necessarily a bad thing but it does feel slightly cheaper wear and tear because it does feel like a slightly lighter material it does have a bit more wear and tear to it you can see some of the fabric coming away at some of the seams but really not that much considering that I've worn it thirty different times number three cost now for 30 bucks I would say that this is a good value shirt it looks good after 30 different wares and it costs less than the Patagonia it doesn't feel like quite the same quality of a shirt but overall I think it's a good value now speaking of value let's see what we get out of a six dollar shirt how is it even possible to design produce manufacture and distribute a shirt for six dollars it honestly baffles me but the outcome is pretty predictable fit and feel this shirt never fit me as well as the first two shirts did but you can obviously see that it's just a bag your shirt maybe this is to appeal to more people but it's clear that over time the shirt has just lost some of its shape now this shirt isn't ripped or destroyed in any way or dirty but I am not very excited to wear this shirt because of the condition that it's in after only 30 wears and honestly this shirt was starting to look used after about 20 wares or so wear and tear even without looking too closely you can tell that this shirt is old it's been worn and you can obviously see that all over the shirt even without looking too closely you can see that there's peeling happening throughout the shirt not just on high rubbing areas there also seems to be some weird discoloration going on around the collar number three cost now for six dollars it's hard to say whether or not it's worth it because it costs less than a burger at McDonalds I mean I guess with that in consideration the fact that it lasted even half as long as the others is impressive but like I said at the beginning how does a shirt like this even exist for $6 farmers had to grow crops materials had to be processed designs had to be created final products shipped delivered marketed and then sold to you for $6 now this is really where price starts to come into play because these shirts not only reflect the quality of the products themselves but the values that the companies that made them try to uphold except for like dolce gabbana and supreme and all that other crap you're literally just paying for the brand name in those cases so I realized while I was editing this video that you can really tell the differences between these shirts super well so I thought I would add in another test to illustrate the differences between these shirts that no one could possibly deny a blindfold taste test well no not at eight like a feel a field test you're gonna get blindfolded now okay go upstairs good there's the stairs wow you're really good at walking blindfolded holy smokes god I wish there was a cooler surprise then here's the first one okay second one okay okay yes here's the stretch test some give the bottom doesn't feel very nice though this feels kind of Pilli it doesn't have as much give still stretchy this one has more stretch than the last one but I don't know if it has as much stretch this one's the most stretchy this is the gorge one this is ever lame this is Patagonia no how did you do that they feel different this one feels kind of chilly in a bit rough okay this one feels this one almost feels a bit like creamier butter people know what I mean and this one's like an in-between I got a right though yeah that's really good those awesome I found that super interesting because without being able to see what she was touching Leah somehow managed to pick them all right I mean I'm not staging this I definitely could have but it didn't somehow she picked exactly the right ones based on yeah can I wear it yeah sure if you want alrights mine now so what's the difference between a 50 a 30 and a $6 t-shirt the companies that created them I chose these three companies very specifically for this challenge because they represent the spread of fashion options available to most consumers we have Patagonia which is a known social and environmental advocate ever Lane which has marketed themselves as an environmentally responsible company but they're not and Gorge that basically couldn't give a about the state of the earth now I've got to be really honest I was super nervous about this challenge because I was mortified that my fifty dollar Patagonia t-shirt was going to be basically the same as a six dollar equivalent unfortunately that's not the case now as you know I'm probably biased I think the Patagonia is an outstanding company because there are very few companies of its size in the fashion industry that have done as much as they have for the sake of people and the planet but right now we're going to talk about this shirt specifically it is the only one out of the three that uses fair trade sewing practices that means that the people who made this shirt likely made a fair wage for the country that they live in they're also the only one that makes all of their t-shirts out of organic cotton a material that is far better for the planet but this shirt is also a Patagonia t-shirt and I bought it three years ago and it's still in pretty awesome condition ever lain actually makes a pretty good t-shirt which I was resentfully happy to see unfortunately their claims of radical transparency greatly mislead a lot of people into thinking that they're more sustainable than they are instead of third party certification through Fairtrade sewing they simply link you to the place where your garment was made but unfortunately none of this can be confirmed because unlike Patagonia they are not a register B corporation but this is not a takedown video about ever Lane I already made that video but all in all I would say that you're paying in part for a slightly higher quality product but also for the idea that you're supporting an ethical clothing company I really wanted to like ever Lane and finally George the crown jewel of the fast fashion industry imagine all of the horror stories that you've heard about fast fashion and that's this puppy right here unfortunately this has become normal unfortunately we kind of proved that you get what you pay for a $6 shirt doesn't last very long so obviously I would love for us all to just buy those really expensive Patagonia shirts because they are the ones that are making a fashion model that works for us and the planet but I understand that not everybody can spring for a $50 t-shirt personally I own a number of Patagonia shirts but I bought them over a period of time I purchased them when I had the means to and when I could find them on sale the beauty of Patagonia and higher quality brands is that if you can find them used they're probably still going to be in very good condition for exactly the reasons that we just outlined here today but the best option is always to find secondhand clothing if you can and support the environmentally focused companies that are out there if that isn't available but I want to thank you for watching this video I don't want to hear your feedback I'm going to be making more videos where I do experiments and challenges to test different environmental practices and so if you have any suggestions please leave them

light transfer paper for white t-shirts and black transfer paper for dark t-shirts when you're first starting out you guys should buy these on Amazon and then you can buy the wholesale and Alibaba for around thirty cents a sheet for the large ones the next thing you guys will need is a Epson WUF 7710 printer and the fourth thing is a large heat press machine so the first thing we have to do is mirror the image let's click tools flip horizontal and now ready to print alright so when you put it on the white t-shirts we're gonna insert an 11 by 17 white paper into the printer an image I just want you guys to understand one thing even though I'm printing with a inkjet printer the ink will never smudge it will be impossible to make the income off the t-shirt the shirt will have to be destroyed this is gonna be a professional quality t-shirt the ink is gonna melt with a thin piece of vinyl onto the t-shirt so when the paper is printed it's not gonna look too bright but when it's on the shirt isn't look much better the next step is to cut out all the white parts the image you can do this with scissors or if you want better results you could do this with a paper cutter don't worry if you don't cut it perfectly because the white areas are barely seen my friend the image is now ready to be printed on the shirt all right guys the next step we're gonna take a blank shirt we're gonna preheat it to get the moisture out we're gonna put the part of the t-shirt which will print on onto the heat plate wait for the silicone paper and press it for about 10 seconds you guys see steam coming out that's fine don't worry and now we'll do the same thing for some bottom the next step is gonna take the image I'm gonna align it on the t-shirt Airport and then we're gonna use paper tape or you guys can use special heat transfer tape to take the image on shirt and now we're gonna transfer an image onto the t-shirt and now I'm going to press it at 300 let's say 50 degrees for around 15 seconds so right now is a very important part if you guys peel while the shirt is hot you're gonna get a matte finish if you guys have the shirt cool off and peel when it's cold the finish will be glossy for this shirt we're peeling it hot to have a matte finish make sure you take the tape off very carefully and as you guys can see we have a professional finished t-shirt if you guys look on the bottom right there's a very small white scratch this happened because the paper was scratched before printing so always make sure to inspect the paper prior to printing otherwise the prints come out perfectly every single time it's almost impossible to mess with the printer we're almost finished we just have to do one more thing and that's to stretch out the shirt and repress it one more time for about 10 seconds to make sure the shirt lasts a long time now we're gonna stretch a shirt out to make sure it lasts a long time when I press one more time put the silicone paper on and do a very quick five-second press the show zone alright guys now we're gonna do a black t-shirt it's nice on paper for this example we're gonna put the small image on the a4 paper so when you're printing on black t-shirts the image does not need to be mirrored we're gonna use our cutter to cut out all the white areas and that we're ready to eat president image so now I'm gonna press the black shirt quick ten-second press so the next step is to carefully peel the top layer [Music] and now we're going to carefully line the image onto the t-shirt now I'm gonna put it into the heat press and press the image press it for around ten seconds at 320 degrees Fahrenheit now with no move the silicone paper do a quick stretch and our shirt is done alright guys the next step is to make our shirt labels the best way to do this is by making plaster salt heat transfer labels you can get these for around 10 cents if you order in large quantities just make sure the image is mirrored before sending it to the seller we're gonna go into google and type in shirt label template right here you'll get a template for the labels you guys can Photoshop your own if you want we will download one of the sample labels and heat transfer it to the shirt I strongly recommend you guys get the classes on cue transfers if you want flawless results every time but if you guys want to do it yourself and get a special Oki laser printer and special heat transfer paper and try it out there is a learning curve to this and the results are not going to be as good as the plastisol labels let's carefully tear away the gilding tag alright guys so we're gonna place our label onto the shirt place the silicone paper over it and heat presses and now let me slowly peel the label when the shirt is finished you will package it in a plastic bag which will cost you around five to ten cents you will then take photos of the t-shirt let's talk about two very important parts of this business the first one is reinvesting money back into the business so for example if you start with $100 you can make 50 t-shirts and $2.00 each shirt if you sell those 50 t-shirts at $10 you will have $500 if you take the $500 you can make 250 t-shirts if you sell the 250 t-shirts at $10 you will have 2,500 and so on the second thing is you guys have to make t-shirts which don't have trademarks and copyrights this is very important if you want to have a long stable business get creative and make really cool t-shirts I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did please leave a like to subscribe and if you have any questions please ask in the comments below I'll see you guys in the next one", "zG48XrN9-ac": "hi there - Michelle Smith with sleet and sassy how are you guys doing today are you wondering are you curious why do we start out with bleach well look here sweet and sassy is known for their bleach teas we have scent shirts all over the United States and today we're gonna do a tutorial on how we make our bleached teas so in the beginning as we always say we like to have our temperature at 400 degrees we like to go for a full minute and here is our design that we're doing today you're thinking oh my goodness how can this blue shirt and this design work on here well with the power of bleaching you know what's gonna happen well maybe you know that well we'll figure it out together all right so we're gonna get this nice and lined up okay alright and so what I have done here is we've of course have our butcher paper on the inside here and then we have butcher paper here and of course we'd like to do our butcher paper on top also so that way that the gases don't go on to your Heat plan okay and so with the power of television okay so here we are my most favorite time let's see what how it turns out so our first time ever doing this design it's for Morehead State University look at that looks really good so here is a secret a secret that's sweet and sauce is gonna tell you take this extra butcher paper that you used for on your top and put it in between your shirt because what we don't want to happen don't want the bleach to soak through on the other side we want to make sure that we are controlling the bleach okay all right so what we're gonna do is we're gonna get ready we're gonna head outside and I'm gonna teach you how to bleach see you in just a bit okay so something that is really really really important is you have to do this on a sunny day if you don't do it on a sunny day your results aren't gonna be as fast but I will have to say that we have done it in Jam wouldn't you say that we have in the winter time we've made these on the inside we felt like our shop was a wonderful clean but alas I like to do it outside so all we did is I just took this from the Dollar General Store 100% bleach we do not dilute it we don't do anything like this and also but the reason why I like to use my tape to press first is I get to see exactly where the design is and that way we don't have excess so what you'll see you're just watching oh I will have to tell you that your squirt bottles you're gonna want to clean those out very regularly mine I go through a couple of we've gone through a couple of week before when we were doing all right so we come in you know a little goes a long way I try not to super over saturate it I should say do as I say not as I do because you probably shouldn't be in your best clothes when you're doing this but you know we're trendy here at sweet and sassy and you didn't want to see me in my yeah right so all right here it is here is the way that we get our fantastic bleach splatters take a small look at this paintbrush I mean it is sad it's time for us to get a new one but we love it it's one of our very favorite ones but watch how I just flick the wrist okay that one looks good so we're gonna let this one be out in the Sun for just a little bit and if you'll notice it didn't go through on the other side because we have both of those butcher papers and you can look here how it's already starting to turn okay so we're gonna let this do its thing and we'll be back in just a little bit all right here we are I'm living how it's turned out so far look how wide it is it looks really really good so now let's time to flip to the back as you can see where the butcher paper was not it did go through on some spots but that's totally okay it's no big deal that's why it's important to have that extra bhushan piper so here's our little one of our signature little twist that we like to have what look I like it that we get to be very creative with these and look it's not even gonna let me do it so that's like our loose starburst like that and now let's flick it again and watch on here it's just a flick you want it to you want your bleach to go multiple places you always add more yes can't take it away it was perfect just the way it was all right so what we'll do is we'll come right back after this changes and we'll tell you how to rinse them out now that we've achieved the color that we're wanting I think it looks really good and in the white what we're gonna do is we're going to rinse it out and I'm going to take it in - you have options you can throw it in the washing machine you can rinse them I like to put mine on the wash cycle and spin and then I let it dry outside guys are you needing blanks sweet and sassy would love to offer these for you what's great about sweet and sassy is we do exactly what you do you know we have a retail side and now we've also we're branching off into the

Daniel and I hope that you fellas are having a good day dressing well and of course getting stuff done alright guys so it's gonna be a nice and quick one today I'm gonna be going through my top ten favorite go-to t-shirts that I personally find myself wearing all the time a lot of you guys always comment in each video what t-shirt I'm wearing so I'm going to be going through all of these showing you guys which are my favorite where I got them from in the price that I paid for them alright guys we are standing straight into it this is a very nice fitted white t-shirt from cause and I paid 25 pounds for this there's two kind of unique features through this t-shirt one is the high neckline which is the main reason I really mess with that I do just love a nice tight high neckline the second is that it's a very light almost see-through material I don't know if you look close enough but you can probably see my mic so it's a very nice breathable one perfect for coming into spring and summer alright guys so staying on the white trend this is my most expensive teacher that I do have this is the acne studio one again similar to the COS high neckline has that printed acne studio a very nice fitting t-shirt absolutely love this this is a lot more of a heavyweight material but it is also quite stretchy so the size every time I wash it it always just comes back to its natural size and I absolutely love it coming on to the third one guys and this is kind of like my most oversized t-shirt that I do have it is very oversized but this is definitely a lot more of a summer vibe t-shirt now the material of this one the reason I like it so much is it is that towel material I got this from All Saints it was on sale when I got it absolutely love it and yet for me this is my kind of more out there t-shirt because I do really like my t-shirts to be simple and played down but with the stripes going across and their texture to this t-shirt it just adds that little bit of detail that I absolutely love so guys coming on down we are entering a round of Col bloody Buxton this dude is just breaking the bank on me because they keep putting out good pieces I have three t-shirts from them the next this one and the next two are all called Buxton but let's get into this one first I paid forty pounds for this is the Col Buxton week a t-shirt is a lot more of a softer material really just sits on the body great for kind of like every day absolutely love this season my favorite black t-shirt completely it is that oversize fit you guys would be the common theme in pretty much the rest of this is just oversized it's just what I like love tucking it in I love having a little bit of that bagginess it's kind of just my style and personality that I really mess with but yeah very simple cannot go wrong with a nice black shirt especially when you tuck this in to some black smack-heads add some Doc Martens perfect you're good to go again guys called Buxton this is their warm-up t-shirt you guys know I did a full review on this there's the first stop I bought from them 60 pounds still love it to this day I love this is the slate colorway it is a great fit is and like kind of a boxy fit the material is a lot more of that heavy weight and license duty I love how simple this one is yet but because of the way they designed their t-shirt gives it that nice kind of vintage feel so it's a great way to add a little bit of texture to a very simple outfit and yeah it's a good colorway the last of the call back someone same warm up t-shirt this isn't happening the colorway but I call it the concrete one if that's how eyes up do it exact same use the other t-shirt nice heavy weight and yeah just honestly guys the Cole bucks and stuff like I'm not just like saying it for the sake of it like I messed with their stuff and anytime they drop a new t-shirt I'm most likely gonna cop it because this is the type of stuff that's always gonna be in my wardrobe as long as my style stays this way I'll always mess with their stuff so this next one is by Val Christopher I think that was a hundred pounds that is quite pricey but it is so unique and there's a lot that goes into it obviously it's quite a bit more tout oversized bit to it man I've actually been thinking about just doing a full video based on this t-shirt because in this little snippet that I've got it's not enough time but what I do really love about this t-shirt is it's the type of one that I will wear when I want to just make a bit more of a statement when I want a little bit more of a unique standout t-shirt but the reason why this is my top ten is because it's still a very subtle t-shirt yet it has its own amazing uniqueness to it obviously there's the so much going on I kinda just want to do a whole video on this but yeah I love it so for a lot of you oh geez you will remember this t-shirt it is definitely one of my go-to yet because we've been in winter I just don't go out for brighter colors but coming into spring and summer you're gonna see this one a lot more this is my small supreme box logo t-shirt this is what I want to just you know what I want is just be a little bit of a height beast for today I want to just be a supreme head you know I just want to be in that game very subtle very still minimal definitely my style definitely great balance between minimal and you're still in that kind of like Street way scene all right guys on to the second to last one and this is my burnt orange t-shirt again oversized boxy and you may have seen some expensive t-shirts my first t-shirt was 10 pounds from Zara I absolutely love it love the fit of it look the colorway of it perfect when you come into order and perfect when you're in spring summer winter whenever I love it guy size large fits really nicely colors great it's just a really nice way to add color to your outfit but without being too bold all right guys last but certainly not least we started with a fitting t-shirt so we're gonna end with a fitting t-shirt as well it's not always about the oversize fits this is the day's march one you guys would have seen this recently again when I add color to my outfits I like it to be in a more desaturated way love the fit of it I love the cotton love the heavyweight material of this and it's just a really good vibe for about three pounds and there we have it guys those are my top 10 favorite go-to t-shirts that I just always find myself going to let me know in the comment section down below guys what is your favorite go-to t-shirt and where is it from

you're looking to branch off from the golden brand it's one of the heaviest promotional teas on the market similar in weight to the gildan 2000 but with an even thicker collar around the neck definitely appealing to those looking for a durable heavyweight shirt all style also offers the same heavy cotton in both a long sleeve style and a short sleeve pocket tee", "BL4SjXrsX8w": "hey everyone so in this video I'm doing an unboxing for Banana Republic t-shirts so I got two different models so I'll really only be trying on two of them but I want to show you the colors and why I got them so first off Banana Republic t-shirts are usually around fifteen to seventeen dollars depending on the sale and I noticed a sale that was going on for a short while for ten dollars each and it's twenty-five dollars for free shipping so I purchased three of them and got free shipping and I was like you know what I already got three I might as well get a fourth one and because what I'm getting free shipping anyways so it's really important to kind of track the prices for stuff you really want and just pay attention to them also following certain forums or communities like reddit's frugal men's fashion also really helps because you get access to a community of people who are just as knowledgeable usually I think ready as a community can get pretty snarky or rude but that's usually when you're posting stuff and others comment versus if you're just a lurker there so so far I like that community I recently found it a few weeks ago and I knew the banana republic crisis inside I followed their stuff for years now so the two different models I got were the supima cotton line and that is the most popular line of t-shirts that they have and then the next line I got was the tech cotton line there was another lineup out there I think but tech cotton is the second most popular and second most reliable after supima cotton I've heard some of their other lines aren't as consistent with their quality I heard some of them will shrink into wash after a few Weir's by a considerable amount so I just wanted something that was very reliable and solid and so I went with their tech comm lines as far as colors go I went with the solid standard colors that you want for meals fashion so white gray and black and navy blue in this case I have enough black t-shirts so I just opted for navy blue grey and white one thing that's I noticed already it was some people were saying how Oh actually one guys said that Banana Republic is just gap and Old Navy rebranded but it's the same quality and that's not true you know I've been a shopper at Banana Republic for a few years now and just if you just put your hands on the clothing and feel it it's higher quality you can feel the difference and then if you look at the tags you'll notice that there's often a little bit of difference in the type of fabric that they use so for some of their t-shirts I've bought in the past Banana Republic adds in a little bit of bamboo or other fabric to their cotton t-shirts and that gives it a much more luxurious feel and I feel like they they put a little bit more attention in detail to the stitching and the fabric and how it finally like comes out and I can sense it because I've bought Gap t-shirts and I've bought Uniqlo t-shirts and many other t-shirts and Banana Republic has a more luxury style the only thing with it is that I think the fit isn't as good as it is with Uniqlo so we'll see if that's actually true Uniqlo is usually a bit cheaper although they recently raised prices so now their shirts are $15 each which is comparable to banana now which is kind of a bummer they used to be $10 each so I got a deal of a lifetime and right off the bat as I open this up I am not so happy look how wide it is and I always get this small cuz I fit really well with small so I don't know what the heck is going on here like I just know it's already too wide like look how wide it is that's that's way wider than I'd like it to be so I'm gonna put it on though usually they're small spit very well for me except for the sleeves which flare out where-where's Uniqlo sleeves fit really well off the bat but maybe you'll fit better when I put it on okay so material wise you know it's got that nice smooth material it's not too smooth it's a little bit rough but it's it has that like comfort that I don't get from the gap t-shirts and that's saying something because a gap and Old Navy and Banana Republic are under the same conglomerate company so they're essentially I think they they all come from the same factories is except the quality and the prices differ it's basically Old Navy the gap and then Banana Republic so I definitely feel there's something about the fabric that just feels a bit more comfy because the gap t-shirts are more rough as far as the width it doesn't it's not as bad when I put it on but look here I like to have no more than an inch maybe an inch and a half and I'm seeing two and a half inches on one side and maybe two inches on the other so it is it is unfortunately too wide I mean if I could if I didn't buy this online I would go to a store and try on the extra small but I can't do that and I hate returning clothing because it's such a hassle sometimes you have to pay for shipping you have to package back pack it back up I don't even know if they offer free returns for this so unfortunately I'm gonna have to keep it is it the worst in the no is it the best no look at the arms they flare out a little bit they're a little bit too long and then terms of the fit you know the chest fits decently but it's it's a little too loose down here like look at that look how much it comes out so I'm about five ten five nine and I fluctuating weight but usually I'm around 160 pounds so I mean think about that so honestly you know the best t-shirts for an Asian man like me have actually been from Arizona tea which is a company that only sells through JCPenney and I've been able to get a shirt winter on sale for five dollars a piece from there and they fit like a glove this doesn't flare out this isn't too wide and then I'll say right under Arizona tea would would be Uniqlo's t-shirts I've tried on a bunch of different t-shirts and yeah so unfortunately I'm not the most happy about this is it the worst thing in the world for ten bucks no is it the best thing for ten bucks no in terms of the makeup of this this one's a hundred percent supima cotton so this one does not have any bamboo in so about one tech Academy three subpoenas because I thought the supima were more reliable with the tech cotton ones they use a different like technology basically for their fabric this ones are supposed to be more moisture wicking and anti-odor so if you ever a big exerciser which I am then this would be great for working out in in terms of the fabric for this one it is also 100% cotton so essentially it's the same material but they're doing something a little different with how they mowed the cotton so here it is it's the same size small and as you can see right off the bat if it's a lot closer to my body it's much tighter all over look at this I got an inch on both sides maybe and that's it maybe an inch and a half if I really stretch it so that's perfect the arms they don't flare out there they're almost a perfect fit they flare out a little bit sometimes I like to have t-shirts will especially polos where there's a elastic band here which binds you to your arms so that it can't flare out this one does not have that which is okay it's mostly for polos where you have that stuff chest is fired a little bit tight in the chest you know belly's fine here of course overall I like this a lot I did hear rumors that this this one might shrink in the wash even more I hope it does not otherwise I would have to order and you know a size up and this would no longer fit but as of right now this one is probably the best option I sure about more Tech and less of the supima cotton that said I really hope these shrink in the wash by half a size or one size because they are a bit too big I'm a little underwhelmed by these and you know Banana Republic it's decent but unless you have really massive arms like if I had massive arms or like a bigger belly I guess Banana Republic all the way I mean I there's like the feel of their fabric is probably the best I've come across but in terms of fit which is more important unfortunately except for this tech cotton one I haven't had the best luck with them I still wear them and they're do good but they're not great I want it like really good this one's all right it's it's starting to feel a little bit tight here and here as I wear it longer but overall there's my review hope you like", "3DTegwqbJ6M": "hey guys how you doing this is home with liberty graphic designs i'm gonna make a really quick video on sublimation so don't go anywhere [Music] okay so i always say i'm gonna make a quick video right and end up ends up being like 20 minutes but i'm gonna try to keep it very short and uh like you guys know on my video sometimes i put a lot of information this is not gonna be one of those videos so okay so one of the things about sublimation it has to be 100 polyester though you can use some blends like for example 65 um uh yeah 65 35 right and you'll get like a vintage kind of look but um a lot of whenever we do sublimation we always stick to why well i'm going to be sublimating this fluorescent orange and then we're going to be doing some other colors obviously this is not white right but there's colors that we can use on this one like for example black blues reds you know stuff like that colors uh um dark color colors like that can be sublimated on this type of shirts so let me show you first uh how to do your uh like regular vinyl right on 100 polyester and and then we'll go from regular vinyl hdv uh to sublimation okay so i have a sheet right here and this is sublimation paper as you can see it's pretty big i just printed this it's 24 by 24 uh using the epson f570 so i'm gonna cut my artwork okay so the first one we're gonna make is gonna be this um fluorescent orange uh a jersey or shirt and this is gonna be actually all this i'm going to make like three different shirts i think it's three different shirts a lot of these are a friend of mine not for the same friend right but they're all they're all very good friends of mine so it's gonna be a like say for example a construction construction uh company this is all we need we don't need a bag i'm sorry we don't need a pillow okay so this is all we need you don't need a pillow for this because you're not going over any seams a lot of people will put the color on this side so you don't print it that's that's a really good idea me i don't care so i'm going to press this for one minute 60 seconds and i have other settings in here everybody prints with different settings i have my settings i have everything everything dialed in the way that i want it again everybody prints like for example they'll say 400 for 60 seconds or uh you know 425 for x amount of seconds me i got my own settings and i'm gonna keep those two myself so there you go that's the front and look at that that one's done and this is what it looks like dang it it's hot that's what it looks like it's nice and dark i mean it's really really black so again those are settings that i already already been playing with um and i printed this on an epson f570 so now we're going to do the back and the back is same same thing and you guys are going to ask yourselves juan you don't use a uh t-square no i don't use a t-square there you go that's the back and you see how dark it looks i mean dang it it's hot it's like really hot but look at how dark that is i mean that's like a true black i mean that thing is it's like it's really really black it's amazing right it looks really really good well you're gonna be like well it's a bright color yeah it is look at that it looks really really good so on this t-shirts right here there's no need to make a screen to screen print it none whatsoever you can use sublimation now let's move over to something a little more challenging black it's a black t-shirt and let me show you against this black t-shirt this is 100 polyester i'm going to show you against the t-shirt so you can see how dark my black my black is you see that you see how dark i am on the uh on the sublimation yep it looks really good okay so now on this one 100 poly no i'm not gonna use sublimation so for something like this if you guys have any sublime any uh polyester shirts like this you know you cannot sublimate black so for that we are going to use regular vinyl you're probably going to be asking why are you using vinyl you can screen print it well the reason why is because this is just one shirt that's the reason why i'm using vinyl so all i got to do on this one change my settings because i don't want to i don't want to heat press it for one minute so that's it peel it hot and then i just give it about three seconds without the uh without the the uh what they call it the carrier i'm not going to touch it because it's like super hot so there you go and by doing that that you know five seconds it really pushes the the uh what they call it the vinyl back into the fabric and notice how my shirts i'm not burning my shirts you see that sometimes when we saw blue maid you can see the part where you actually burn the shirt okay so now we're gonna move into yet another shirt and the next one is gonna be this charcoal gray so charcoal gray let's see what happens with the sublimation and the reason why i'm doing this video guys is so you guys can get an idea on how dark you can get sublimation to work so we're going to take our sublimation on a dark gray shirt so a lot of you is going to say it's not going to work because sublimation is supposed to work only on white t-shirts or light colors let me change my settings okay so let's see if our dark um garment worked look at that you see that so a lot of people will say somebody mentioned dang it that's hot it's like really hot a lot of people will tell you sublimation only works on white t-shirts no it does not depending on your settings and how good your you know your printer is this is how good you can make it look so let's throw a logo on the front just to kind of finish that shirt and then after i do this logo i'm going to show you something real quick [Music] also notice when i lower my press i went real slow when you're doing sublimation you want to go real slow if you don't if you didn't apply adhesive or put a heat tape on it you want to you want to lower your press real slow because if you if you bring it down too fast the wind uh that you create by pushing it down can move the artwork and that's the front of the shirt and you can see it's nice and dark really hot too see that so this is a very dark shirt and yeah you can still make it work okay so the next shirt we're gonna make is gonna be this um gray one and the color and this one is actually silver that's the color on this one silver and this one we're going to do a number and do a number on this one um this is a jersey for like a soccer team okay so except for the number and on this numbers this is really cool because on the number i even in i even did the logo of the team um so that's what it would look like on a gray shirt and it actually looks it looks really good okay so but one thing i wanted to show you and i'm gonna show you on this red one is this one's right here they get a logo on the sleeve so a couple of things you got to do on the sleeve if you're going to do a logo on the sleeve do it where the sleeve is actually folded just like that like it is and then put it right there or whatever is going to go right in this case it has to be right in the center of the of the sleeve well if we do that so usually stick your hand inside so you can get it right in the center and then you follow the crease right see that crease okay so when you're working with uh something like that it has seams i'm actually where i'm where i'm placing the the print there's no seam but the seam is on the other side so what you want to do is you use a piece of foam any foam would do just make sure that you put a piece of teflon teflon sheet on top of it so it will be something like this so you will put your sure like that right and see right now the crease or the seam i'm sorry the seam is right here and there's the crease so that that's the center of the shirt now if you put a piece of foam in there the this right here will sink into the foam and you can you can go ahead and sublimate it and you won't have a problem but if you sublimate it directly on the planet the blonde there's not going to be any room for that for the um the song part to go anywhere and you're going to ruin the shirt it's not going to sublimate um it's not going to sublimate properly the best way to do that is if you get a pillow but if you don't have a pillow and this is one of those heat press uh pillows so if you don't have a pillow you can go to walmart um hobby lobby uh joanne's or whatever where they sell a foam and you can buy a piece of foam that would be the cheapest way however if you're gonna go this route i suggest you put a piece of a teflon sheet parchment paper any type of paper to protect the foam from getting sublimation into the foam uh it doesn't matter if you get sublimation on the foam right you can throw it away but if you get sublimation on the foam or any type of um ink on the foam it's going to transfer over to the to the next garment so this is what it's gonna look like okay so if you use a foam make sure that you adjust your pressure because now uh you added a foam this thing is not gonna close see it just won't close so adjust your pressure try it and um and then go from there i already lost my my little crease make sure you put it upside down and now we can sublimate the sleeve there you go sublimate it using a regular piece of foam and you're gonna probably ask yourself oh you're gonna probably say juan you said to use to cover the phone yeah but if you notice i'm only using that little part right there so there's no way that the ink can get over there but just to be on the safe side make sure you use something to cover that foam you see everything is sublimated then this thing this thing is hot so so look at that i mean you can actually tell where the the sewn part was or the seam you can see where this the seam was right there i can actually see it but if you notice everything sublimated correctly so by using a piece of foam you can um you can get away from you know so um from these uh seams right here just by using a little uh cheap piece of foam one thing i forgot to mention guys uh when you're doing multiple shirts this is some sublimation okay so as you can see i went and got another shirt but one thing is very important that you do is make sure you put a protective piece of paper like on the other ones you didn't see me using that but i'm gonna show you real quick because uh sometimes the when you're doing the sublimation sometimes when you're doing the sublimation this is sublimation paper right sublimation will actually bleed through depending on what kind of settings you're using on your paper and what kind of paper you're using so it'll bleed through the paper and actually stain the uh um what do you call this the teflon the teflon sheet and then when you go to apply an or when you go to supplement another shirt or garment whatever it is you're using or sublimating masks t-shirts whatever you're sublimating that image is going to be imprinted on your teflon sheet and you can actually stain the other shirt or whatever it is you're using so i'm going to show you real quick uh what i mean by that because i didn't explain that on the video i was about to edit the video and i was like let me let me fix this real quick so let me show you real quick what i'm talking about okay okay so we're going to do this shirt right let's say for example on this one we're going to do the number this one's going to be number four so i've been doing this for a while if you guys if you guys don't feel comfortable just placing the the number or whatever it is you're gonna sublimate like that uh use a ruler so you're straight i've been doing this for a while so well i i don't use that anymore but this is what i'm talking about grab a piece of butcher paper uh even regular paper will work um let me fix this right so it doesn't slide on me this is what i say i'm look i'm in the market for another heat press because i like to thread my my shirts and this one i can't thread them so if i was to thread it see you know i'll be stretching the the shirt because it's already hidden at the bottom so that's what it means by threading a shard is is where you can put it inside the machine so that's why i'm i'm in the market for another heat press so okay so going back in this right so um several ways of finding your center you know you can fold it in half just make sure that your uh that your edge to edge but in this case we're just going to put it about right there and then the position and the numbers you want to leave enough space just in case they want to come back and say can you add a name so if you put your name your numbers up too high you're not going to be able to add a name in the top you're going to have to do it at the bottom so i usually i usually place my num my numbers about six inches from the color down um that's where it's going to go so and then this is what i was saying put a piece of parchment paper a piece of butcher paper even regular paper however this paper that you're gonna put in here has to go in the trash after you use it and i'll show you what i mean okay so now this is what i'm talking about um i know you're not probably not going to be able to see it on camera maybe you can but there's a very let me get this out of here um so there's a number right number four and what i was telling you about it'll bleed through the number or through the paper um depending on your settings so i don't know if you can see it but there's a very faint uh image in there of the number well if you don't if you don't protect your your heat press that will bleed through and you you're going to put an image on your um on your heat press or your teflon sheet and then when you go to when you go to press the other one you're going to have like for example not all the shirts are gonna be number four but i say for example we'll go to number five you're gonna have the number five and you're gonna still see the number four in there um trust me uh right here you can hardly see it but when you press a shirt and watch i'm gonna show you just so you can see it let me see if i can put a print um i have this material here this is what we use for some of the mask this is white so we're going to try to see if we can get that number to sublimate because you're going to be able to see it on the white print better than you can on this piece of paper so this is just replicating let's say for example you put another shirt in there um like for example the number five or number three whatever you know okay and after you use this paper pla make sure you throw it away um this is pretty cool it actually cleaned the ink that was in this paper it actually took it i mean it completely cleaned the the ink that's pretty cool yeah because i can't even see anything anymore but if we look at our print again it's very light but it's right there again i don't know how good you can see that on the on the uh on the video but it's right there i can see the number four right there it's going right there over here again you can hardly see it but if you're doing multiple shirts that's gonna get uh brighter and brighter and brighter and then you're gonna ruin a shirt okay so again i forgot to uh to show you this i forgot to tell you about putting a piece of uh a lot of people use butcher butcher paper um perfectly fine whatever paper you want to use uh if butcher paper is too expensive you can just buy a rim that's what i call it right a rim of paper regular printer paper and then just put it on top to protect the the heat press or the teflon sheet that you're gonna put in there that way if you transfer anything onto the the um not only the shirt but to whatever you're protecting you can throw this away and measure you can only use this once so use it once and throw it away get get rid of it don't use it again because you'll see how it actually um and this one you can hardly see it see this one i couldn't even i can't even see it but even though you cannot see it trust me you want to get rid of it just in case if there is residue of uh adhesive in there i'm sorry not adhesive of sublimation ink in there again depending on what your settings are and what i mean by settings is what how much ink you actually actually deposit on the sublimation paper i like to do a little extra myself because you get better prints that way so so yeah make sure you use some sort of paper so you protect your heat press so i forgot to put that on the on the regular video that's why i came back i didn't finish editing the editing the video so i came back and redid this one so you guys uh can see what i'm talking about okay now also on the other video i didn't show you uh how i was doing the sponsor and everything so let me show you real quick so it's really it's really easy for you to mess it up once you uh line up everything say for example that's where it's gonna go when you lower this if you lower it too fast did you see that how that one moved so that's what i'm saying be careful you can add adhesive just regular adhesive you don't have to go buy that expensive pro spray that you know you can buy of i don't know i can't even remember the johnson plastics i think sell some on a lot of people sell those you know pro sprays this is regular spray adhesive that we use for screen printing you can use this just spray a little bit so just enough so it'll stick wherever you want it to be at now even if i move the shirt that's not going to move well flip it over it will right um but that has enough enough adhesive for the for the graphics to stay on and it won't mess it up trust me the adhesive will not transfer it'll it won't stay on the shirt and it's just a little bit i mean i just sprayed a little bit so yeah you so you want to apply just a little bit of adhesive so the the um what do you call it the print doesn't move and then don't forget to put your paper on it because remember the reason why we put in the paper is so it doesn't transfer onto the heat press and that's it remember we grab this piece of paper and again on this one i don't see any transfer but even though even though you don't see anything get rid of it because there could be something there that you don't see because i literally don't see any any transfer on there but we're gonna throw it away and as you can see if you add adhesive to it um the adhesive completely leads to i mean it won't you won't have any residue and you don't have to use none of that you know pro spray that they sell and that's it now remove that shirt okay now if you do happen to transfer some ink into the teflon sheet either the bottom or the top one keep one of these bottles handy uh this is just a degreaser and what i do is i take one of my whole shirts and as you can see it's all orange so spray a little bit in there just like that this is just in case if you did transfer some and clean it and just clean your plant and you'll be ready to go the um what they call it the degreaser will take any uh residue that you left in there okay so i just wanted to i just wanted to point that out because i forgot to like let you guys know or you know show you that little trick but yeah thank you for watching guys

do a how-to or instructional video so i figured i would go ahead and give it a shot um first i want to go over quickly the things that i use to sublimate i get a lot of questions about what do i use and what works best for me so i have an epson 77 or the workforce 7710 printer that i converted into a sublimation printer i got the conversion kit on etsy it works great for me i currently use printers jack ink from amazon but i am in the process of flushing out my system and switching to cosmos ink i don't really have any problems with printers jack it has worked great i just hear a lot of good feedback on this cosmos ink and how much brighter it is so i want to give it a try but i can't speak on that yet because i have not tried it yet i also have the fancier studio 15 by 15 heat press there are 200 on amazon it works great i've had no issues out of mine whatsoever this is actually my second one the first one lasted me about four years and it was a trooper because i put it through a lot and when it comes to sublimation paper i don't use sublimation paper i use hammer mill multi-purpose copy paper i get the 11 by 17 because my printer fits up to 13 by 19 and that's just the size that i prefer now this is not a sublimation paper but i have done several tests and trials and this works great for me and it's very cost effective it's like 12 dollars for an entire ream so that is what i use for my sublimation that is also what i use to cover my sublimation when doing a sublimation on a t-shirt i do not use butcher paper or wax paper or parchment paper or whatever it is they say they want you to use i've always just used copy paper and it's always worked great for me um and of course i treat all of my shirts with spray brite and whenever i use my peroxide mixture i'm just using regular hydrogen peroxide that you get from the dollar store or from walmart and i'm mixing it with water so now that you know everything that i use um i guess we're gonna jump right in i'm going to show y'all how to pour in the spray i get a lot of questions on do we need to mix it um how much water do we mix it with and the answer is no no no it comes ready mixed for you so that you don't have to worry about ratios mixing you don't have to worry about any of that all you have to do is shake shake your bottle to make sure there's no residue at the end at the bottom you shake it up real nicely i guess i shouldn't have this heating under the press because it looks like it's trying to melt okay and then we're going to take our spray bottle we're not adding any water just straight from the bottle transferring it into our spray bottle this spray bottle already had a little bit of spray right in it all right and spray bottles in order for spray brite to work you need a decent spray bottle your spray bottle needs we prefer these these are offered in our store it has an adjustable nozzle so that you can adjust how heavy or light your mist is because in a spray bottle with a spray brite you need a bottle that can do a heavy mist a heavy even mist um and as well as a spray bottle that can handle something a little thicker than water going through the spray nozzle and i always suggest after each use to take your spray bottle just take your spray nozzle off like this put it in a cup of water spray this down the sink like if you um if you put it in a cup of water like this and hold it over the sink and spray it a few times then that's going to run water through your nozzle so that the spray brite's not going to harden up in your nozzle and i know that sounds like a pain but it is 100 worth it if you've gone through a hundred bottles spray bottles um because i forget i forget and then it clogs up and it is almost impossible to get them unclogged or i guess i haven't found a way to get them unclogged so i just like to rinse them out these spray bottles are available in our shop uh with certain purchases of the larger items and this is not the one that you have to have for spray right to work this is what i have found through trial and error this is what i prefer and i like my customers to have a good spray bottle because it really does affect the quality of the shirt and the outcome if you have a spray bottle that is streaming that is not spraying evenly that is spraying too splotchy then your design is not going to come out it's your spray bright is going to spray thicker in some areas lighter in some areas and that is going to come for or call for a splotchy design so i recommend these bottles but if you can find a good bottle that has a good heavy even mist perfect also i use a rubber roller to rub the spray into the shirt these are this particular one was about nine dollars on amazon and i will show you a way to use i will show you a way to sublimate without the roller but i have found the roller just to be more time efficient and convenient okay so what we're going to do is we're going to spray this shirt we're going to treat this shirt with spray bright this is a 100 cotton gilded shirt and then i'm going to switch it out for this shirt that i sprayed last night so that we're not waiting for it to dry so the first thing you want to do my press by the way is at 400 degrees for 60 seconds the first thing you want to do is lint roll your shirt there's been times where i've looked at my shirt and it doesn't look like it needs to be lint rolled so i skip that process and once i've sprayed the shirt and everything's locked in i see fuzzy fuzzy fuzzies so i always lint roll regardless if i think it needs it or not okay after i lent roll i'm gonna make sure that my sprayer is on a good even mist and mine is actually acting funny so i will be right back okay so i've actually been using that sprayer for a couple of months and it is clogged up i just used it last night and i forgot to rinse it out it can be unclogged i just didn't want to take the time to do it so i switched out for a new sprayer so the first thing we're going to do is spray an even coat of spray bright where the design is going to go um some people like to print out a copy of the design or you know measure to find out more closely of where it's going to go i just kind of eyeball it and this sounds like a lot of phrase but i have mine set on a pretty fine mist so we just want to make sure it's good and even and if you have a roller then you would take your roller and just roll a couple of times along the spray braid now you really do have to find a good healthy medium when spraying because if you spray too much your shirt is going to be very very stiff and you're going to have a ring like right now you can see where it's wet but if you spray this will dry and you won't be able to see that if you spray too much then you're going to be able to see that ring regardless and it's not going to wash out there is nothing you can do to make that ring come out i have peroxided and kind of rub with my finger and try to work work it out sometimes that does help but it's best to just try to find that healthy medium so that it's not getting too stiff and leaving the ring so i'm going to show you oh and if you don't spray enough then it's not going to hold to your shirt very well and your design is not going to be as bright and it's going to wash out so you really have to make sure you're finding that good healthy medium and you have to make sure the entire area is covered because if you left a hole that's not covered that part of your design will wash out so i just showed you how to roll it on with a roller i am going to show you if you don't have a roller once you spray it you fold the shirt in half onto itself and then you rub your shirt your hand on the back of it and that's to rub the fibers to rub the spray right into the fibers so that it bonds very well and is holding on to the cotton fibers making them act as if they are polyester fibers i see a spot here i'm gonna reapply to it was i'm not sure if my design will go this far or not but it's better to be safe all righty and so after you spray it you can leave it under the press it takes about five minutes to dry under the press or you can let it hang dry if you're doing multiple shirts a lot of the times i'm doing 100 shirts at a time and so what i do is i will lay them all out along my work desk spray them you know treat them and then hang them up to dry and i just kind of get an assembly line going so if you're just doing a couple of shirts and you want it to dry fast you can leave it under the press you can pull the press down just a little do not or i would suggest not closing your plate down onto the wet fabric just hold it above and i think it takes about three minutes to dry that way but i'm going to set this shirt aside because i have a shirt that is also 100 cotton that i sprayed this exact same way last night and it dried overnight all right so i can feel that this is a little stiff being stiff is completely normal the stiffness will wash out after a few washes i have never had a customer complain about their shirt being stiff i'm not saying that your customers won't complain i know everybody is different everybody has different preferences um but i have sold thousands and thousands of shirts and i have never had a customer message me and say hey my shirt's really stiff so i don't think that it's that big of a deal and i understand to some people they may not like it that's just the nature of the beast i guess so this shirt is completely dry we are going to go ahead and sublimate a design on this shirt and again this is 100 cotton now whenever you're sublimating if you were to sublimate on a 100 cotton shirt some of your transfer will it will transfer i'll show you a couple of shirts that i have done with no spray at all and with spray the spray will transfer but it will be dull and it will wash out very quickly when using the spray bright what you're doing is you're bonding these fibers to the shirt you're bonding the spray brite to the fibers in the shirt and this is giving the ink a surface to hold on to a polyester like surface to really lock into and i have shirts that i have been wearing and washing for a year a little over a year because i've been using spray bright a little over a year so i have shirts that i've been wearing and washing for a little over a year some of them weren't applied correctly so they have more fading and some of them that i applied you know once i got my my pattern down the ones that were applied correctly are still going strong after me wearing them regularly and washing them regularly for over a year so the spray brite really does help this was 400 degrees for 60 seconds and we just peel this off and there we have our design on 100 cotton so before i uh lift it up i can see there is some yellowing around the surface and this is scorching this is where the fibers or the spray kind of burn a little bit on the heat press so i have here hydrogen peroxide mixed with water i fill about this is an eight ounce bottle i put about three ounces of hydrogen peroxide and then fill the rest up with water and just do a light mist where i see the yellow and then allow that to dry most of the time just spraying it the one time will work the scorching out once and sometimes i do have to spray it two and even three times but the hydrogen peroxide has always gotten the scorch out for me and i have noticed um you can go over with your roller too if you want to kind of push it into the fibers but i have noticed that on my bleach shirts the scorching is much more significant and i'm assuming that's the bleach plus the spray brite all just burning so i do have to be a little more diligent with the hydrogen peroxide on my bleach shirts i don't get a whole lot of scorching from from the 100 cotton and on the white but i don't do a lot of these shirts to be honest my my specialty is the bleach sublimation so this is our design on 100 cotton bright vibrant and i am going to grab a couple that i did yesterday to show you the difference okay so we have here a 100 cotton shirt that has been treated with spray brite these have not been washed yet and we have a 100 cotton shirt that was not treated with spray bright as you can see the design did transfer there's there's a big difference but the design did transfer but where you will see a big difference is when we wash this um i'm gonna grab one that i have already washed we have okay this shirt here i did a 50 50 coverage so i folded it in half and sprayed this side and did not spray this side and this is after uh i guess about four washes you can see that this design is still bright and vibrant on 100 cotton and this design is almost gone and it will be gone after a few more washes so that is really the difference that spray bright makes this one is i've had a lot of people asking about our glitter spray bright we do offer glitter spray bright and i don't know if you can see the sparkle in the camera but this was sprayed with on 100 cotton with our glitter spray bright and this glitter will stay in the design for as long as the design is on the shirt which will be a very long time this has been washed about four to five times and it is still very bright and vibrant on 100 cotton okay now i'm going to show you a couple of bleached tees and these are gildan soft style 65 polyester 35 cotton and i get a lot of people asking do i really need to use spray bright if it is on 65 polyester okay no you really don't need to this is a 65 polyester no spray bright just bleach and sublimated okay it's pretty it's great i would i would sell this but this shirt with the exact same shirt exact same bleaching method exact same materials used same design but this shirt was treated with spray brite and here is your design here so let's just get a comparison so no you don't have to use spray bright when it comes to the 65 polyester but it definitely makes a difference and it's definitely my preference i always use spray brite well guys i think that's all i have for you today if you have any questions feel free to reach out um thank you for being patient with me as this is my first video i've never done anything like this before and again if you have any questions please feel free to reach out i hope that i made this clear we are working on new ways to apply the spray bright more convenient ways to apply the spray brite um we haven't really released that yet so i'm going to wait and do a video on that later we are also working on a concentrate to be able to sell you a larger amount that one you will need to mix with water but we will still offer our original that you don't have to do any mixing and it's ready to go so the concentrate is just for customers who want to buy in larger amounts but it's not really cost effective to ship those larger amounts for the customer or for myself so we're gonna do a concentrate for those also definitely look into this glitter spray right it is a game changer it's been a big hit customers love it my spray brite customers love it my kids love it definitely try it out um again if you have any questions please feel free to reach out thank you so much for being patient with me and i hope you guys have a good day", "XR2jVs1iJJ4": "everyone my name is Mark wacht and we're talking about my favorite things so during this quarantine time I think people are their wardrobes have become a bit of a mess I mean you're basically wearing loungewear or some sort of like t-shirt and sweatpants maybe through the entire day if you're working from home and I know a lot of you guys are working from home and so I have this favorite brand or this favorite set of loungewear and I just want to share that with you guys today but we're talking about reigning champ I'm not sure if you can see the logo here reigning champ so out of the reigning champ stuff I'm a huge fan of what we're talking about today and that is the t-shirt I've been trying to find the perfect balance of like this high quality garment but also very comfortable and something that I can wear during the core team during any time where I'm just like lounging around at home and reigning champ has been that brand so as you can see I have a white t-shirt on right now a white t-shirt is a complete and utter essential in any wardrobe whether you're woman man old young it doesn't matter you need a white t-shirt so I bought a white t-shirt like this I would say black is the same way getting a black t-shirt like this as well is very very important for your wardrobe but I also even have a couple other colors so this is a navy I have an interesting story about this particular t-shirt in a second and I also have the gray so man this is the four t-shirt like this is gonna last me you know if you're not taking a shower every day this might last you a whole week potentially you know so what are you looking for in some loungewear so obviously you want it to be comfortable I think you want the quality of the material to be high because you're gonna be washing this quite often you might work out in them you might sweat like crazy in them it doesn't matter you need to be able to wash them over and over and over again and that's harsh on the fabrics the higher the quality of the fabric is the easier it's gonna be able to kind of withstand that and stay alive for a long period of time on to the story that I was trying to explain so this is the Navy shirt from writing channel this is a you know something that I've had actually for over a year and and I think it still looks great I mean there's not really there's no holes there's no stretching there's no it looks like a shirt you can buy off to the rack today I actually got in an accident where I was hit by a car while running so it's a long story it was crazy like I was in shock and everything at that but I did end up getting like you might be able to see here like a bunch of scars on my arm but you'll notice that the scar ends like in a line right here I don't know if you can see that right there but that's because I was wearing this t-shirt and it's so interesting to me hey that this t-shirt basically survived a car crash and this left arm is where that that kind of like where it would have like scarred me here but and I imagine the t-shirt would be completely wrecked after that but it's fine I don't see a single rip or tear or anything like that so I don't know if that's the ultimate test like you shouldn't you know don't go get hit by a car just to see how good your t-shirt is it just gives you an indication that like this these things are strong like they can actually the the fabric is good enough that you can put it through the wash of bazillion times and you're just fine now if that's the case though that means that you have to spend the extra coin generally here's the brutal truth these t-shirts MSRP retail are like 40 or 50 dollars like that's a lot for a t-shirt you actually can go to Nordstrom Rack or their sales that happen every year I would wait for one of those sales and they drop the price of these to like somewhere like $30 so my recommendation would be to wait a little bit and then get t-shirt in one of those sales again I'd point that Nordstrom Rack is one of those places to get it I would also recommend that you get the main colors now you know you've seen in my stack here I have black navy gray white I mean that's about is that's about as universal unit you can wear those with pretty much any outfit whether you're indoors and in a quarantine in front of webb-kim or you're you know when we've got back out there you're like out and about and you just have a t-shirt and a jacket or something like those colors will work with pretty much anything it is gonna be more expensive than other brands but your most of that money is going towards the quality and the design and not so much the brand yet I think they haven't quite gotten to that point yet and so for me like these have outlived the the reigning champ stuff has outlived Nike stuff for me neatest stuff for me you know gap and then or public j.crew like that's that's the sort of stuff I used to have and I think this is kind of the next step and I don't regret taking that next step during this time I hope everyone enjoys their loungewear cuz they super comfortable yet super fashionable and yeah so there it is reigning champ is one of my favorite things I'm mark Kwok I'll see you the next one [Music]", "-2uThGtI6bo": "Oh [Music] hi I'm Krista with Bella canvas today we're a detailee print to do a deep dive into sublimation printing and show you some awesome effects you can get on some of our different Polly blood sublimation works best on garments with 50% polyester or more so today we're going to do some testing on a poly viscose Club and try blend so Michael can you explain the process of sublimation for us absolutely sublimation is printed on paper first the ink from the paper actually turns into a gas with enough heat and pressure and actually sublimates onto the synthetic or colleague part of the fabric sublimation only uses cyan magenta yellow black so the white or lighter colors is often used as negative space which actually creates pretty cool effect we have some paper in between each shirt what is this used for we put this paper inside it's not mandatory create the cleaner print the sometimes on thinner fabrics to ink and actually pass through to the other side so if you're only doing a front you might get a little residue on the back we are going to start off with our poly visco this is actually a new style to our line the content for this is 65% poly 35% miss Joe Sosa so it has a high content of polyester so what print do you think we should do on this style right now all over prints are really in I think I'll be perfect for this it would work great all-over print top to bottom sleep the sleeve I'm excited let's go do it let's do we like to give it a 10 second press festive blot in the shirt get any wrinkles out of it it's like a basically a giant iron I'm going to go in give it 10 seconds now we have a flattened shirt so you're gonna get a much nicer print here I'll take the paper we want to make sure you're grabbing all the steam and you know we're going to wait 30 seconds but now that we take it off that that first pre-press a lot of times you'll see a lot of inconsistencies around the seams the armpits the next that first 10 second press really gives you a better product so this looks awesome I really love it on our white I'm excited to see it on our Heather stuff let's do one yeah the next program of your club this content is 50% polyester 37.5 per second 12.5 percent rayon so it'll definitely work for sublimation what print do you think we should do on this fabric so the slub really gives a unique effect to the prints we get a lot more highs and lows I would probably do a vintage prints and out which are not really nicely so why vintage print on the club since you're not doing 100% poly automatically you're going to get a vintage affective livings you know print to it it's only sticking a 50% of the poly higher the poly the more vibrant image is going to be of course does the lower the poly the more vintage goes I know it's going to look like it's been washed 20 30 people I personally love a vintage print so I'm excited to see what this is gonna look like so let's go do it yeah so I see that you didn't leave the club in as long as you left the poly disco so is there a reason for that each fabric you're going to want to test temperature and time we're just going to have a little bit of a different reaction to that oh that looks great this fabric really pairs well with the vintage picture so next we're going to do our tribe 1 we're really known for a tri-blend we have the most color offerings in the industry and this fabric is actually offered in about 20 Styles across our line and this is the raw neck which is new to our fast fashion collection so what print do you think we should do on this fabric I think of a more colorful print you know you have the weight you can go bright you know I think a print like this would turn out really nicely on that another reason I would use a vibrant print like this the blend of this fabric of this island is automatically gonna dull it down give it that vintage effect again you want to go with a more vibrant you're automatically going to get a vintage print if you were to start out with a vintage it might be a little bit too low you know so you just want to let the fabric to its thing my favorite design so what catch are we going to have the travelers going for this one's going to be at around 400 degrees Fahrenheit 25 seconds actually you'll actually see depending where the poly the caught in the rayon is in the fabric it's going to each pick up the color a little bit more automatically you're going to get some variances and some uniqueness to each print let's see what we got oh great you can see the blue the green and I mean the detail you'll never get that in screen printing screen printing uses up to a 360 mesh pounds which is actually 350 little meshes per inch per square inch with sublimation you had a much higher rate so it's really a digital print direct to the garment basic print looks like it's actually a part of the shirt which i think is so cool it is actually these fabrics are now dyed with those things as the sublimation turned into a gas they actually turned back in to a solid on the fabric let's turn now awesome this is our vintage looking Los Angeles print on our unisex Roenick scheme Michael thank you so much for having us in today we learn so much about sublimation on all of our different poly blends and I'm excited for us to more videos with you you guys are always welcome here love working with you guys and I love the styles are coming out with if you want to stay tuned to what Michael's up to follow them on dpla print on instagram you can always follow us on our Instagram Facebook and please subscribe to our YouTube channel we have a ton more content coming your way [Music]", "ZURo6WJUi54": "hi guys I'm looking a little raggedy today because I'm getting a lot of housework done here on Labor Day but part of what I'm doing one of my chores or tasks today is to take a shirt that doesn't fit me and somehow make it fit me target has these great new Star Wars shirts but they're in the young men's department so they're all athletic fit and they only go up to a 2x so I got a 2x and I need a 3x and a regular fit but I've got a little method that I use to kind of make a shirt work for me and I'm gonna show you that today give me a second here and I'll show you a full shot of what I look like in the shirt okay so here's a full shot of me in the shirt as you can see it's uh not doing me any favors and the sleeves really tight around the midsection getting some unflattering roll action here you can see the my shorts underneath the zipper and all that kind of stuff so not not perfect a little snug I also really don't like how tight the neck is so I'm going to see if I can stretch the fabric a little or work the fabric a little to make it work for me and I'll show you what the processes that I use okay here's a better shot of the graphic you can see it's really cute it's got sort of an 80s vibe to it the fabric is 55% cotton 45% polyester which means once I get this once I work the fabric the way I want to it'll probably pretty much stay that way we're gonna start off making the neck hole a little larger to me when you see the small crew neck neck hole like this it is a clear indicator that a woman is wearing a man's shirt woman's neck holes even for the crewneck shirts tend to be a little bit roomier not as tight so what we're gonna do is make it a little larger by very gently pulling on the fabric notice I'm not pulling on the seams down here when I pull I'm pulling above it now if worse comes to worse and you have a neck hole that will not budge and it's driving you crazy you can cut the neckline off just above the stitching here and it won't be you know the net well the neckline won't fall apart and then when you have like a seam in here too you want to pull in front of that seam and pull behind the seam so that you keep the seam intact okay let's take a look at it and see what it looks like now that we've stretched it out a little bit Wow as you can see that made a huge difference that opening is much much larger now in the shirt and will look a little bit more feminine so the next thing we're going to work on is the sleeves the sleeves on this shirt are a little short and a little tight definitely really really tight around here so what I'm going to do with this is the same thing that I did with the neckline giving it a good stretch being really careful not to overdo it with the seams remember to protect that seam they're a little widen the armhole a little bit and then to get the length that you want on the sleeve to be a little longer you're just going to stretch the fabric down notice I'm doing I'm like I'm sort of like taking it and gathering it up as I go down and pulling it across you don't want to just randomly rip out it be a little thoughtful the process so that is something I'll do I'll pull down on the sleeve more like that I'll repeat everything I did to the sleeve here I'll repeat widening the sleeve and I'll also repeat this process a couple of times to to make it a little wider here just gently pulling the fabric to stretch it so I'm gonna actually take a moment to go through and do that same process to this sleeve a couple of times and then I'll pull over the other sleeve for you and show you the difference and what a difference it makes just to stretch the fabric a little bit okay as you can see after just a moment or two of doing a little bit of light stretching on the sleeve there's a significant difference in the size maybe about three-quarters of an inch in length and width so this is fantastic we'll do this to the other sleeve and then I'll show you what to do to give you a little bit of more volume around the bottom of this of the shirt so for the bottom hem of the shirt you're gonna work it just like you did the neckline and sleeves you want to be very careful and mindful of your stitches that you don't pop them but you're gonna give it a nice steady stretch like this all the way around I like to do it two sometimes three times and you'll do it the entire hem all the way around and then move up the shirt gather the fabric towards you and start doing the same stretch for width across the front and back of the shirt I want you to stop though when you're stretching across the top of your shirt stop when you get to the graphic you do not want to stretch the graphic if you stretch your graphic it's going to crack you want to stretch the areas below it and you can work the areas above it and if you need to get more stretch in the fabric or for this area here across the abdomen or across the bustline you're going to stretch the fabric on the back of the shirt where there isn't too graphic you can work the living daylights out of this fabric back here one of the other key things I want to let you know too is after you've stretched the width of the shirt across the front you're going to grab the fabric and start stretching it lengthwise don't grab the whole shirt just like open it up put your hand inside of it like that and stretch the length if you only stretch the width of the shirt what you're gonna do is you're gonna make the shirt shrink it'll be wider but it'll be shorter so you do have to work the fabric in both directions both across and both down and just be mindful of the graphic and you should be great okay so I put the shirt back on for you so you can get a better look at it I don't know if you can see I try to shoot this so you can see it better but the neckline is not as tight up here a little bit looser a little more room it's not like choking me to death and as you can see it's no longer clinging to my midsection like it was before it's a tiny bit longer I mean actually have that blouse stuff a little bit but it's a shirts a little bit longer a couple inches longer definitely a few inches wider it definitely has more give in room in the sleeves sleeves still aren't my favorite thing I can still work on those because there's yet another step to this process the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to wash the shirt and then after I wash it I'm going to gently go through that same process of where I will pull the fabric across the width and then also the length to continue to give it length and give it a little more give in areas where I need it probably a little more through here and also the sleeves and the neckline so I'll show you that process coming up next well it looks like the shirt came out pretty good straight out of the wash so when I washed it I washed it in cold water with other bright colors and I did it on like a regular cycle light too regular cycle and now that I have a damp I'm taking a look at it and you notice that neckline that maybe looked a little stretched out before like you could see the waffling is no longer there there's no waffling because when I washed it it just maybe it tightened up a little bit I'm not sure but that's one of the things that you can expect to happen when you wash the garment naturally the fibers will tighten up a little bit so what I'm gonna do now now that it's damp is I'm gonna follow those same steps we had before where I'm going to go ahead and work on the neck a little bit be careful here because when it's wet it's going to stretch a lot it'll shrink up a little bit when it dries but it'll really really really really really stretch out a lot when it's wet so you know you don't want to go too far and stretch it out so much that it's completely out of shape so what you want to do though is when you are stretching the fabric every now and then stop take a look at it make sure it's going in the direction that you want it to go in and not like getting overly big or you know hold up the garment on the bottom and make sure your hem is straight all the way across and like your back your garment isn't longer than the front unless of course that's the way you want it so what I'm gonna do is the same thing like I said before that we did before where I'm just gonna gently pull the fabric out my issue that I had before was with the sleeves and I still think the sleeves look kind of small so I'm gonna work on the sleeves a little bit I'm gonna work on the neckline a little bit and probably the bottom hem or like the center section the midsection of the shirt and stretch it out a little bit and then I'm gonna hang it up and I'll show you how I do that I have finished stretching my garment and I think I have it just about the way I want it so now it's time to hang it up I have a little tip for you I use the joy Mangano huggable hangers I think you can get them at Target you can also get them on hsn.com they're great because they have like a little light flocking on the fabric it keeps your shirts and tops and even tank tops and things from slipping off and they're generously sized so you can if you're a plus size person these are great hangers they're not oversized but they are big enough to really accommodate your shirts so one of the things you get sometimes when you're hanging a shirt is where the end of the hanger is you get like a little point and then when you go to put the shirt on this little point of a little poof of fabric sticks out and it looks a little weird and it doesn't lay flat here's a little tip on how to avoid that so I don't know if you can see what I'm doing here but I'm taking this seam in the shoulder and I'm lining it up directly on top of the top edge of the hanger so when you do that this fabric in the shoulder seam is a little stiffer and it's not going to get that little pinch that you sometimes get with hangers but these hangers tend to be better about that anyhow because they come down on the edges on the bottom a little so you probably won't have as much of an issue with that but that's basically what I do I line it up like that and I hang it up so I'm going to hang this up and just let it dry for a day or two and see what it looks like I'll try it on for you and another day or two and we'll see what it looks like if I'm not happy with that I'll probably dampen it again and do another stretching session and then rehang it but I'll be back in a couple days to show you how it turned out well here it is the finished project as you can see a little bit looser in the neckline definitely plenty of room in the bust a lot more room through the midsection and a little bit more length the sleeves have a little more give a little more room and in general it's just a little more comfortable to wear so normally I would wear a woman's 4 or 5 X and if it has Star Wars on it or Disney on the front of the t-shirt you know it's going to be 30 to 60 bucks so eight dollars for shirt from the young men's section that's a 2 XL that I stretched into maybe the size of like a 3 or 4 X in a men's size shirt you can't beat that price eight dollars so you're not only stretching the shirt but you're stretching your budget and you know check out different places like Walmart check out Target and JC Penney's in their men's and young men sections you're gonna find great shirts anywhere from $5 to $15 so much more affordable and a lot of them are in unisex colors like this aqua there's pinks there's purples there's a little mermaid there's all different princesses check it out don't rule it out and you can save a lot of money so go ahead and try this yourself it's worth the investment of just a few dollars and a few minutes of your time you", "o7vSoC2w_A0": "hey guys we're going to switch gears a bit and we're going to talk about actually sublimation transfers i've been wanting to do a video on how to actually apply the sublimation transfers to a shirt and so i figured this is as good a time as any right okay so few things to know about sublimation okay sublimation is uh dye sublimation is basically just that you're dying fabric um with these uh sublimation transfers okay so one thing to be aware is sublimation does not print white so if you like you see this white right here that's going to be whatever color your shirt is okay so the other thing is you can't dye dark objects lighter you can only dye things darker so that's why it's important for sublimation to use a white or a very light colored shirt because if you put black on a black shirt you're not going to see it if you have pink on a black shirt you're not going to see it so you have to use light or or white as best but white or very light colored shirts as far as um a little bit darker colored shirts if you wanted to do like maybe a like a blue jean color or something like that you can do that but it's best to do that with an all black sublimation transfer black's one of the only colors that you can kind of still see on a darker shirt as long as it's not darker than the black so hopefully that answers some questions about that that's one of the biggest questions we get is why can't you do sublimation on dark shirts it's just because you can't see it so even if the the dye is transferring to it you won't see it on a dark shirt but you will see it on a white or a very light colored shirt the other thing to be aware of for sublimation is sublimation dyes only adhere to polyester fibers so what happens is when the dyes get heated up heat it up it actually infuses into the polyester so the more polyester content that you have in your shirt or um whatever you're pressing the brighter and bolder the colors are so if you have like a 50 polyester shirt with 50 cotton it's not gonna stick to the cotton but it will stick to the polyester so it'll be like a faded look so that's another thing to keep in mind the higher the polyester count in your fabric the brighter and bolder the colors will be another thing about sublimation is before you press it the colors are going to look really muted especially like blues and mints turquoise those colors will look completely different after you press it's weird so don't freak out whenever you print out your sublimation if you're doing it at home or even if you order one and it looks completely different it changes once it's heated it gets a lot more bolder brighter vivid and the blues and greens those change a lot so hopefully that answers a few questions okay oh another thing for sublimation you want to use a heat press or you can use the easy press 2 because you need 400 degrees fahrenheit and iron will not work unless you're doing like a little bitty tiny thing because you don't want to move it around at all when you press it you want to keep it like and not move it like it's got to stay still so easy press 2 will work because it does get hot enough or heat press is definitely definitely recommended iron and sublimation just do not mix okay so here are some other tips and tricks okay sublimation will go through your shirt okay so you always want to put something in between your shirt or you want to actually thread your shirt onto your press rather than just putting this on here like this pressing it because you're going to see this mama bear transfer all the way through to the back especially for thin shirts so anytime you're using sublimation you always want to protect your press with protective paper and then you always want to protect the inside of your shirt if you're not threading it through so for this one when i say threading it through i just mean opening the shirt and putting it on your press where only one layer of the shirt is on there that's always the ideal way to press if you can because then you don't have any seams messing you up or anything like that so this would be considered a threaded shirt all right so we're going to go ahead and put our shirt on here i'm going to move it to where the collar is not actually on the press anytime you're pressing it's always good to not have the collars or the seams on the press because anything like that can make it where your shirt isn't getting full pressure okay this is a bella canvas let me see this is a bella canvas shirt and it is i want to say 50 polyester 65 actually 65 polyester you want to have at least 50 but like i said the higher the polyester count the bolder and brighter these colors will be all right so we got our shirt on there we have our protective paper right now i'm just going to use this teflon sheet just to do a quick pre-press to get any moisture out of it all right remove that now here's another thing to be aware of for sublimation you'll notice that it's on this square okay now lighter colored shirts usually won't happen but if you're using like a more colored shirt a lot of times if you just put this down and you press it like that you're going to see that square so a good habit to always be in is anytime you're pressing sublimation just loosely cut around your image it just will soften that edge and just make it look a lot nicer another thing is if you're printing your own sublimations or ordering them sometimes whenever it's going through the printer you'll get little bitty dots of ink on the edge if you don't cut those edges off there's a chance that you won't see it and you'll miss it and you'll have like these weird little black lines okay and this does not have to be perfect this is just loosely cutting around so that you can really see where your image is and that you won't have that box around your sublimation okay um let me get one more thing one second okay okay another thing you always want to do before you're pressing a sublimation is use a lint roller and just get any loose fibers or anything like that off your shirt because sometimes if you have some loose fibers or anything like that you'll see these weird little blue and red marks after you press it because we're pressing for a for a full minute for sublimation so any of those little things getting pressed at 400 degrees for a minute can actually change colors and permanently affect your shirt and your outcome okay so we have our shirt ready we have it pre-pressed we have it lint rolled we have our transfer cut out our shirt is at least 50 polyester is 65 so we're gonna put the transfer face down okay so the ink side will be on the shirt now from here you don't want to put a teflon sheet straight on your transfer because what happens is once the ink um gets heated up and turns into a gas and any extra will kind of dissipate so if you use a teflon sheet that extra ink will just kind of sit on your teflon sheet and you'll need to clean your teflon sheet if not you won't notice it until you go to press something else and that ink will actually transfer onto something else so always use some protective paper you can even use um regular like copy paper is totally fine to just put on top okay so we're just gonna put a couple sheets of copy paper on there we're gonna take our teflon sheet and we're gonna cover it all with that okay and we're going to be pressing for 60 seconds at 400 degrees okay and y'all just be careful once this is done it will be hot so just be prepared for that okay once this is done you just want to remove your transfer immediately not let it move and then sit somewhere else or you get like a ghosting all right remove that and that is it so here is our sublimated shirt mama bear this particular design is available on the website as a digital download and it also is available as a ready to press transfer so that is sublimation is super easy it's not just for fabrics you can use it for any polyester coated item so there's tons like there's tumbler cups there's a whole bunch of stuff that you can use um sublimation for as far as washing this is permanent you can wash it and dry it like normal no issues and it will last a long time the other question i get a lot of times too is can you reuse the transfers they're not really made to be reused but sometimes like a darker transfer like this if you're okay with a much lighter version you can put it on there and press it again it won't be as bold and vibrant as the first one but you will still get some ink transfer but just be aware you know if you don't like it you can't take it off so definitely sublimation is permanent the amazing thing is sublimation it has no feel to it so all it does is it actually changes the color of the fabric so i hope this was helpful you guys we get so many questions about sublimation on the website you can order custom sublimations if you have an image that you want printed or if you have questions on how to print your own you're welcome to message us we can give you some recommendations of some good printers and good machines if you all have any questions please comment down below i will try to answer them as as best as i can to as best of my ability as i can but i hope this video was helpful i appreciate you guys watching don't forget to like and subscribe and i will see you all next time bye", "hfoawy9_ayg": "today I'm going to test out dye press poly tea spray sublimation coating for t-shirts which allows you to sublimate on cotton yes even 100% cotton t-shirts if you've been in the sublimation business for long you know this is a long awaited item I found out about dye press from a sublimation form and just had to give it a try I bought this bottle on Amazon for $64 it is concentrated and will make half a gallon of the solution I'm not sure how many t-shirts that will make but seems like it'll be quite a few after my purchase from Amazon I discovered that I could have purchased this for $30 from going to die press calm I believe plus the shipping I think was six or seven dollars but I'm not going to send it back to Amazon because I just really want to try it I already bought it it's here and I'll leave you with the information on where you can get it cheaper than Amazon in the description below well you will need for this process is of course the dye press poly T spray a light colored cotton t-shirt this one's actually ninety percent cotton it was cheaper I bought a pack of five of these for like under $12 at Walmart and you will need this spray bottle or something that will put a fine mist it doesn't really matter honestly because you have to get the whole thing completely soaked but I bought this fine mist one because someone had recommended it and you want to use distilled water so I'm supposed to have one ounce of the dye press Holi tea spray and seven ounces of water however my spray bottle my mister that I bought it does not hold seven ounces of water so I went a little bit under if you know that two tablespoons is about an ounce so I went a little bit under that for the one anyway to go with the six ounces of distilled water that I have going this in the my spray bottle already have that set up and ready to go now I'm filling it with six ounces almost to the top I'm just ready to shake it up and get ready to spray it on my shirt so I have my concoction here one ounce of the Die Presse poly tea spray and seven ounces of water give or take and I'm going to put a Teflon sheet inside my shirt because I only want to spray the front I don't want the back to get soaking wet and you're supposed to spray it until it is nice and damp let dry completely before you sublimate on it let's go my first time I have this continuous spray bottle of see how it work not too terribly continuous here's my t-shirt hanging up to dry in the bathroom didn't want to throw it in the dryer because I wasn't sure if that was allowed maybe I'll try that next time who knows brand-new dryer so I don't know if I want to okay now we take it apart and we're just gonna spray regular water through it so that the nozzle doesn't get clogged with the poly stuff because then it will ruin our sprayer and we don't want that then I'm gonna put the lid back on and save what I have left I almost used like half of the spray bottle so I used about a half an ounce just to get the front of that shirt way the directions that come with the the dye press do say to pre press for 15 seconds at 375 degrees so that's what I'm gonna do you know a lot of times I separate my designs into two pieces if I want it to be this was this way if I want it to be a little bit bigger than what my printer will print which is eight and a half by fourteen is the largest size it will print so I printed this on eight and a half by eleven I printed this on a larger legal size paper and then I cut them out and I can kind of put them together piece them together on there so that it has a bigger design make sure it is all pre pressed and I'm going to I'm just going to start out by laying the top one where it needs to go fits perfectly I have a smaller heat press mine's only 13 by 13 which I should have actually gotten a larger one so that's there I'm putting two pieces put your paper on as recommended and we press it with a heavy pressure for a minute and ten seconds so I did go ahead and put the second part of the design on there the first one turned out okay it was a little bit light I think I'm not sure if that's because we're doing it at 375 degrees instead of the usual 400 but that was what was suggested in those instructions so let's see how the whole thing turned out it does also say not to use the spray that makes it stick to the shirt use it and it sticks just fine alright so here we have it it's fine it's a nice shirt to wear to school when I'm subbing this is the school I'm subbing at and it's a little right I have to say I don't know if I would try it at a higher temperature next time but it definitely does work and I will I'll give it a go and I'll wash it too and I'll let you know how that turned out so here I am in my shirt that I just made it has been washed and dried it's a little white I think in the future I will experiment with temperatures because 375 degrees for dye sublimation is really a low temperature and that is what it the instructions said to use but I feel like it needs to feel hotter so the design is like the main thing I like about having this option with 100% cotton is that pilot percent polyester is not always available so in a pinch if you need a shirt you

things that people have done I've tried them all and mix it up and made my own deal basically yeah just got to do everything that they do and put it all into one that's what I did so it doesn't work that well on a really stiff t-shirt those really crazy crazy 100% cotton shirts that basically can stand up on their own doesn't work that well on them but about five or six of my other shirts came

t-shirt so the system worked really well in this this is really really super soft of course it was already soft so that was I was kind of a no-brainer the second one was skinny Jimmy's shirt the design with my friend Ken this worked really well too this shirt was um was a pretty standard t-shirt it wasn't a super heavy shirt but it wasn't a like a softie so now it's a softie and system worked on this great this was a hard team this t-shirt was pretty hard Atari Matt to some music for Donnie TV and and I've done an episode on him he's amazing and I really want to wear a shirt nah the system worked really good on this this I ran through twice I ran through this the system two times and now it's perfect I love it this I ran through the system three times this was this was a regular 100%

let's begin alright guys so we're going to talk about all the different ways you can make t-shirts we will talk about direct garment screen printing how to make t-shirts with a vinyl cutter how to make t-shirts the professional laser printer we will talk about budget ways to make t-shirts and print on demand we will also break down the complete process and talk about the pros and cons of each before we get into all of that let's talk about how to buy blank t-shirts and the different types of shirts you can buy there's going to be many websites where you guys can buy wholesale t-shirt blings in this example we're going to use jiffy shirts.com just so you guys know you don't need any kind of business license anyone can purchase from these sites these sites will sell t-shirts anywhere from one dollar and fifty cents all the way up to around eight dollars if you guys are going to be selling cheap t-shirts on ebay you can go with something like the gildan g500 t-shirt these start at around 1.50 but if you guys are gonna be selling high-end t-shirts for your fashion brand it's better to go with something like a bella canvas or an american apparel shirt these are more expensive also just so you guys know white t-shirts will always be the cheapest if you're getting black or colored t-shirts they will be more expensive if you guys are starting a high-end streetwear company in my opinion one of the best shirts you can buy is the american apparel 2001 shirt now if you guys buy this t-shirt be very careful they have a cheap version of it which is called the 2001w this is a horrible quality t-shirt don't buy it it's nothing like the regular 2001 that's made in the us t-shirts will also come in different styles regular t-shirts and fashion t-shirts regular t-shirts will usually have longer sleeves and the more loose fit whereas fashion t-shirts have a short sleeve and more of a european fit a shirt like the gildan g500 is going to be made out of regular cotton and is going to have more of a cardboard feel to it whereas a t-shirt like a bella canvas or an american apparel is going to be made out of ring-spun cotton which means the shirt is going to be much more higher quality and it's going to be much softer all right guys let's talk about the different ways to make t-shirts just so you guys know no matter which method you choose you will need a heat press machine and i'll leave a link in description the first way to make t-shirts is dtg printing which stands for direct to garment printing this means the blank t-shirt is inserted into the printer and the printer prints directly onto the shirt this is great for one-off prints or if you're making t-shirts with pictures these printers usually cost over ten thousand dollars and one of the best printers is the epson f2100 this is industry standard the good thing about these printers is that you don't have to purchase them outright you can always finance them for around 300 a month just so you guys know websites that make custom t-shirts like printful and teespring they all use dtg printers these printers print extremely high quality and the image will not wash away or fade you can also make black t-shirts without a problem the printers also print in white color so you can make black t-shirts if you're printing a black t-shirt you will print the white ink first and then the printer will print the colors on top each shirt will cost around two dollars to print if you use factory epson inks before you print on the shirt you will also have to spray it with a pre-treating liquid this will make the colors very bright and will also protect the shirt you will then heat press the shirt and the shirt is ready if you guys do buy a dtg printer i really suggest you get a real professional heat press which costs around a thousand dollars so let's talk about the pros and cons of dtg printing the pros are prince professional quality t-shirts very high detail it's very easy to set up and print it's very fast to print you can make black t-shirts with white ink the cost to print is very cheap and you can make one-off t-shirts the cons or if you have bad credit is going to be expensive next let's talk about screen printing screen printing is the oldest way to make t-shirts it's also the most popular way screen printing is the cheapest way to make shirts if you're mass producing one shirt let's talk about how screen printing works screen printing is not for when you're making just one shirt like dtg it's for mass producing one t-shirt first you will need to buy the screen printing machine if you guys don't plan to open up a print shop you don't have to buy a huge one you can buy a small one you can get the machine for a couple hundred dollars you will also need to buy a large format inkjet printer you will need to buy transparent film screens frames a uv light machine and inks the way screen printing works is that you will have to make a screen and frame for each color that's on the t-shirt so if your shirt has four colors you will have to make four screens and frames the first thing you will do is divide the image by color in photoshop and then you will make a screen for each color layer you will buy transparent film and then print each layer separately on your inkjet printer using black color you will also print registration marks on each sheet so that you can align perfectly you will then buy emulsion you will take your screen put a motion on the screen put the film on the uv machine and put the screen on top of it you will expose the screen to uv light for a few minutes the printed parts that did not hit the uv light will then become very fragile and you can easily wash them away with the water hose you will then put the screens onto the screen printing machine and you will use a squeegee and apply ink to every shirt if you guys have a large screen printing machine you can make a lot of t-shirts very fast inks for screen printing are extremely cheap so it's very cheap to make t-shirts the cool thing about screen printing t-shirts is that you guys can also do all kinds of metal colors metal colors such as gold and you can also make fall t-shirts so instead of ink you can use glue and then apply foil and make metallic shirts you guys can also add rhinestones if you want to make rhinestone t-shirts let's talk about the pros and cons of screen printing the pros are you can start a professional t-shirt business with around 1 000 the quality of the t-shirts is going to be great and they will withstand a lot of watches the cost to make a t-shirt is extremely cheap and you can also make all kinds of cool t-shirts like foil the cons are if you plan to make just one t-shirt it won't make sense because the startup time and cost is just not worth it which leads to the next con and that is that it takes a long time to set everything up also screen printing can take up a lot of space and can be a messy process also unlike dtg printing which requires a digital file you have to store your screen somewhere and that takes up space now let's talk about one more thing that can be done with screen printing which is kind of cool and that's plastisol transfer sheets what a plastisol transfer is is basically a screen print that's printed on either a clear film or a white piece of paper and then sent to you and you could heat press it onto your shirt so you don't have to actually do any of the work the only thing that you need is a heat press machine and you're good to go there are a lot of companies that provide this type of service and you guys can get plastic solid transfers for very cheap one color starts around 15 cents the only thing is you guys have to pay a 25 feet to make the screens so if you guys don't want to buy all the equipment this can be a great alternative now the next way to make t-shirts is by using professional laser printers so no guys this cannot be a regular laser printer that you have at home this has to be a special led printer an example is a okie printer which prints white and color these printers can cost up to ten thousand dollars depending on how large they can print and whether or not they print white basically the way it works is that you print the design on the transfer sheet and then heat press it onto the t-shirt you will print the design on one shirt and then heat press it onto a glue side of another sheet and then peel it and press it onto the shirt you guys can also make metallic fall shirts this way simply print on one sheet put the foil over it press and peel the foil the best transfer sheets in my opinion are forever transfer sheets they're the highest quality let's talk about the pros and cons of laser printers all right guys so the pros of laser printing is that it's fast and easy it's not messy and you can also make all kinds of unique designs such as gold metallic foils the cons are obviously it's expensive also the good quality transfer papers are not cheap and to be honest with you guys i prefer the results of dtg printing much more than laser alright let's talk about the next way to make t-shirts and that's with the vinyl cutter alright just so you guys understand with the vinyl cutter you cannot make picture t-shirts the way vinyl cutting works is you insert the sheet into the vinyl cutter and the vinyl cutter will cut out your design you guys can buy different color vinyls and you can also buy unique vinyl such as glitter and metallic you can also buy special vinyl such as 3d vinyl where after you heat press it the vinyl becomes puffy you can also layer different colors together and have a multi-color design you guys can also buy cheap vinyl cutters such as the cricut machine the machine will come with a 3d designing software you will simply make your stencil you will then insert your vinyl and the machine will start cutting it out after that you will need to weed out the parts of the image that you will not be using you will simply take a weeding tool and remove the unnecessary parts you will then heat press the image onto the t-shirt and your shred is ready let's talk about the pros and cons of vinyl cutters the pros are vinyl cutters are cheap and you can make great quality t-shirts easily you can also make unique t-shirts like glow-in-the-dark foil and glitter shirts the cons are you cannot print photos and unless you guys are importing from alibaba in large quantities the photos can be expensive all right guys very quick let's talk about how to get tags for your t-shirts there are going to be many websites such as custom labels for you where you can order woven tags and paper tags free t-shirts these are very cheap if you order in large quantities they can run as little as 10 cents per tag you guys can choose if you want sonar tags or if you want iron on tags when you order your t-shirts off of jiffy shirts you would simply cut the tag off if it has a tag or if it has a tearaway label you just tear away the label and apply the tag we talked about plastisol labels earlier you guys can also order plastisol labels on websites like etsy you guys can get these for as little as 15 cents per label alright guys very quickly i want to talk about a couple of budget ways to make t-shirts first ways you guys can get an inkjet printer and use transfer sheets it's recommended that you guys get a printer that prints a3 which is larger images you guys can get a printer such as the epson wf7710 this is a great option also this printer can be converted to a sublimation printer if you want to go that route you can get a sublimation spray spray it on a blank cotton t-shirt print the sublimation print press and you have a sublimated t-shirt keep in mind this can only be done with white shirts these printers recently went up in price so if you guys don't plan to do sublimation you can get any regular printer that prints a3 for cheap when you guys print on the transfer sheets you will use the original ink now this information ink these are great ways to start a side hustle but if you guys want a real t-shirt business i suggest you save up money and go with either dtg or screen printing let's talk about the next way to make t-shirts and that's print on demand this is one of the best and easiest ways to start a t-shirt business and requires no startup costs but the catches you guys need to be somewhat social media savvy and know how to drive traffic to your store with print on demand you don't have to buy any equipment or blank t-shirts this is all done through a third-party company whenever you get an order they make the t-shirt and send it to the customer make sure the designs you guys upload are in a png file which means it's a transparent let's talk about the pros and cons of print on demand the pros are you guys don't have to buy any equipment or t-shirts and there's no startup cost the cons are if you guys are making these t-shirts yourself it will cost you a lot less also you need to learn how to drive traffic through social media for this to work alright guys let's talk about how to make designs for your t-shirts if you guys know how to design t-shirts yourself that's great but if you guys don't don't worry you can go on websites such as fiverr.com and have your designs made there you can pay anywhere from five to twenty dollars to have a design made when you guys are finished make sure you always get a master adobe illustrator file or a photoshop psd file this way if the files need to be edited you can always do that alright guys i hope this

The result is called Airlume. It starts with clean\ncotton about 25 to 30 percent of the cotton we start with is combed out \nduring our unique refining process. Because it contains impurities or does\nnot meet our standards. It's a common practice for manufacturers to dump some\nof that inferior cotton back in before spinning the yarn. But for us when it's\ncombed out it stays out. We only use long staple cotton in our Airlume process.\nThe staple length refers to the length of the cotton fiber. And this determines\nthe ultimate feel of the final yarn. By using only long staple cotton there are\nless stray fibers which keeps our yarn smoother on the microscopic level. This\nmakes for a tight even knit ideal for screen printing. We continue to innovate\nthrough the dyeing process. Using seven times less water than the industry\naverage and only using the most eco-friendly dyes.

is it says blonde on it a cool message and I like it and like this one which we'll be talking about in a second the reason I'm bringing up shirts is because most people are searching for how to find the vintage field shirt or how to create the vintage field shirt on on shirts they have at their house already for stuff that they can find around their house and if you search online like I did over and over again you come across this recipe that says salt water and even baking soda sometimes mixed with water put the shirt in it make it sit and let it sit for three days and then come back and you wash it and it's great and it's good to go in it's perfectly vintage and comfortable and song that is false completely false okay the only thing it did accomplish from what I saw and I tried it a few times with different variations of the recipe same result it does fade color so if you are trying to fade out a dark color that's a good way to do it but it doesn't make it softer and in fact I think a lot of people are saying it makes it a little bit more stark to your rough on the skin so I did my own little research and I found a simple way to do it and it's really good okay so what you're gonna need is a shirt like the one I have here okay now you have to remember certain types of certain are only gonna get a certain measure of softness and vintage feel okay so if you have a hundred percent heavy-duty cotton shirt it's only gonna get so vintage okay or so soft because it it's simply a thick heavy shirt so it if you start out with a good brand then it's gonna get even better okay so what you're gonna need is a pumice stone or a pumice stone this could be found at a lot of stores in the beauty section for like four to six bucks I think and it's well worth it because I've used it a lot and it hasn't even degraded at all really a cool little tool there for what we're gonna use it for and then you have fabric softener which is also four to six bucks I think and I did Google this and ultra downy is actually you want to stick with ultra or whatever it is but ultra downy is actually one of the most effective brands of fabric softener and then surprisingly enough you're gonna want some tennis balls brand new tennis balls don't get used tennis balls I prefer about six maybe more of you if you're doing a lot of shirts okay so the process is you're gonna take the pumice stone first the first step and you're gonna lay your shirt down on the floor on a table and pin it down somehow on all fours or some other method and literally sand your entire shirt okay and starting from the shoulder all the way down and you're gonna probably want to spin this is including the sleeves okay very important even the collar on the collar send it up a little bit it what it does is it's gonna break the fabric up a little bit so that when you do put it in the solution later it'll be more effective okay and it's very soft on the skin when you're done all right so you're gonna sand it up and like I said two or three minutes after you do each side turn the shirt inside out so that it's soft on the inside too okay and do the whole the whole shirt should probably take you seven to eight minutes to do you thorough beat be firm and just do the whole shirt thoroughly and once you're done you're gonna take it and put it into the solution the measurement of this solution is one cup of water to one cup of fabric softener for one shirt tank I guess I should have done one for each of those anyway so you're gonna put that in your tray or bucket and let it sit for 24 hours that's what I've been doing and it turns out great I'm sure if you leave it in longer it's even better maybe a little less I don't think it even matters that much but definitely several hours okay when you're done rinse the shirt out thoroughly okay because it's gonna smell strongly of your fabric softener which is a strong smelling agent then you're gonna take it to the washing machine and wash it again now wash it probably with no soap but if you need so fun but wash it when you're done watching it this is where the tennis balls come in okay I'm gonna take the tennis balls and put them in the dryer with the shirt the reason for this is it's gonna act kind of like the pumice stone did and it's going to be abrasive on the shirt and add that little bit of breaking down to the fabric so that when you do wear it it's gonna feel amazing okay so dry your shirt remember one thing though this is goes for washing and drying when you do high heat it tends to shrink the shirt a little bit sometimes it doesn't last very long but definitely immediately once you put it on it will shrink the shirt so just make sure you wash and consider that little tidbit of information so that's basically how you create a vintage feel shirt from a shirt that you own in your house now out of materials you can grab its view on a DIY and I hope that's helpful once again if you like the shirt I'm wearing or the shirt I showed you earlier go ahead and check out noted art dot weebly.com and maybe you can get a shirt that I made and I do this to all shirts but either way thank you for watching and pee", "OuauAnNkJ7k": "hey everyone welcome back to my channel today I'm sharing how I made a t-shirt for my sister with the Cricut easy press - I have a Cricut easy press unboxing on my channel where I make a t-shirt on that as well but I just wanted one video dedicated just to this and I'll get started in Cricut design space and I am going to click on upload and upload image in brows and I bought this at SVG off of Etsy and it showed up in my downloads and I had to unzip the file and I already did that and then here it is so I'm just gonna double click on this and then I'm gonna click on complex and continue and for some reason this SVG had a background like this so I'm just gonna click on it and it'll erase the background that I don't want and then I'm also going to click on these little spaces in the letters and then I'm going to click continue and then I'm just clicking on this one here on this side this is a print them cut so I want this one and I'm going to hit save and then now I'm just going to select this and I am going to insert image okay so we have our in our image inside of Cricut design space and I am going to make this 9 and a half inches so I am gonna do that for the width so I'll go up here and select nine and a half and hit enter on my keyboard and then that's all I have to do for that so that I am going to click on make it and since this is an iron-on project and we are using each HDTV which is heat transfer vinyl I am going to mirror this so I'm gonna select mirror and then I'm going to click on continue and I already have my dial set to iron-on on my machine so I'll just show you on my machine how I do this I place my iron on vinyl on my mat shiny side down and there's always three important things to remember when you're doing iron-on projects and that is to mirror your image in design space and to remember to set your dial to iron-on and to place your vinyl shiny side down I am using Ceasar easyweed which is by far my favorite iron-on vinyl to use and I bought this off of speedy vinyl comm but there are so many other great websites out there that sells this and I know a lot of people buy it off of Amazon I pull my vinyl off of the mat and I always like to slightly bend my mat and the material comes off then I weed out my vinyl I feel like iron-on vinyl is the easiest to weed out [Music] then I just cut the carrier sheet down a little I set my easy press to 330 degrees at 30 seconds the sea is yellow while lighting up and it turns green when it's ready the Cricut website has a reference guide on their page that I like to go off of and I will link that down below I place my mat down and then place my shirt on top if you don't have a mat you can use a towel instead while my Cricut ez press is warming up I preheat my shirt by placing the easy press on it for around 3 to 5 seconds and this just removes wrinkles and moisture and the shirt that I'm using is the Bella canvas brand and it is in size medium and it is unisex and this shirt is really soft I'll link this down below I bought it off of Amazon and you can also buy this off of jiffy shorts comm I have a little trick to line up the vinyl on your shirt first I fold my shirt horizontally at the armpits and then I take my easy press and press over the fold [Music] this will leave a little line that will help me make sure that my vinyl is straight and not crooked next I fold it vertically and I line everything up with the armpits and then I earn over that fold as well you will be able to see an X on the t-shirt next I measure about three inches down from the collar and that's where the top of my vinyl will go and if I have a scoop neck or v-neck I usually only measure about one-and-a-half inches down then I fold my vinyl in half to find the center I would recommend not folding it together on the sticky side I have messed up one of my designs doing that before because it got stuck together I place the vinyl sticky side down and then I just line it up with the lines that I made with my easy press [Music] then I set my easy press over the shirt and press the start button I actually did four different presses on this shirt because I couldn't get it to all to fit the EZ press I'm using is the nine by nine they do have a larger ten by ten by twelve easy press and I will just link that below I'll link all three easy presses below and it's okay to overlap the easy press while doing these four different presses and you just apply gentle pressure while you're doing this until it beeps and the machine is really nice because it counts it down for you then I peel off the carrier sheet it's okay to peel this Caeser easyweed off when it's hot but I believe that Cricut iron-on vinyl is a cold peel you just need to double check with whatever material you are using to see if you can peel it while it's warm or if you have to wait till it cools down all the way [Music] then I turn the shirt over and press the back of the shirt for about 10 to 15 seconds I'm not sure if this is an absolutely necessary step but Cricut does recommend to do this so that is why I have been doing it and here's the final project iron-on projects are probably my favorite things to do and give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and subscribe if you are new to my channel [Music]", "WHO9MQp6ZOA": "[Music] hey everybody it's oxana here with craftymore design today i'm going to show you guys how to do this bleached out patriotic cow shirt so what i'm going to be using is sublimation paper which i am actually using the 11 by 17 the asa brand from amazon the transfer butcher paper from sublimation tape and i'm going to be using a type dispenser which this literally has changed my life and makes it so much easier to grab tape so i'll post links on everything below if you guys want it i found all this stuff on amazon so if y'all want a video on all my cool amazon craft finds let me know hook you guys up as far as equipment goes i am using a heat press that i got on amazon and i am using an epson printer that i actually converted from a regular printer alrighty first things first i'm going to be using silhouette studio i have the business edition so it looks like that little blue s right there i'm going to have that transferred uh what i'm going to do is i'm actually going to go up here to object and i'm going to press mirror so make sure your item is selected and then go ahead and just flip it horizontally and that way when you print it out it will be printed out horizontally so when you apply it to the shirt it will be placed on correctly another thing i'd recommend is when your sheet comes printed out it's basically just square like this what i would say is get some scissors and just cut around the edges i got my butcher paper cut up i'm going to actually put it on the inside of the shirt the reason being is once the transfer is on the shirt the ink will bleed to the back so to protect your shirt you don't want to waste money on on your material go ahead and cut out butcher paper go ahead and put it on the inside of the of the shirt on the inside of the shirt and then you guys will want to apply one last one on the top of the shirt so um that way your your shirt looks good looks professional you don't have any ink bleeding um going through so this is kind of the end of it it's in the inside and then you guys will want to apply one last one on the top of the shirt so so i'm just taking the transfer and i'm going to lay it directly on the shirt make sure it is even we will use your transfer tape to go ahead and just stick it on the edges so that your shirt does not move apply it directly on top boom press down 365 degrees for about 60 seconds you can do give her give or take a little bit more or less um because i'm bleaching the shirts the heat will uh make the ink a little bit more dull so i actually leave it on a little bit longer than i typically would on a regular shirt all right i just took off the shirt from the heat prep [Music] so it's a little bit darker because the bleach is what's gonna turn it white now if you notice this is as soon as it comes off the heat press how the neck is a little bit higher up the sleeves are a little bit more uncomfortable what i'm going to do is i'm actually going to cut around it to kind of give me that little bit of a more of a loose neck that way i can you know put a cute little tank top underneath kind of have a fun display with my shirts i mean you're bleaching your shirt out it should be a fun shirt to wear so uh yeah hey guys part two of bleaching a shirt so materials you're gonna have clorox you're gonna have a spray bottle i got this at dollar tree shirts um something in the middle of them so that the bleach doesn't bleed through to the back and leave like a giant circle so what i use is i actually use priority boxes because a they're free and b you can reuse them and they're just really thick cardboard so i actually cut mine in half that way i can get more out of them once they dry you just reuse them you need a really hot sun so with the hot sun you need to be refreshed so i actually drink these stevia energy drinks they're sugar-free they're sweetened with natural sugars so so good literally my fridge is stuck with them they have different flavors so i'll post the link before uh below but these literally are the best you're going to get your shirt going to lay it down take your divider put it in the middle so you're going to take your shirt your uh bleach spray bottle um some people will delete it with water i really don't care so i just use the full straight on weight once you have your divider in find just a concrete or grass surface or whatever and lay it down first things first you're going to want to spray the main image all around it because you want it to be the most white and then you'll go ahead and just do different techniques on the side so i'm just going to spray it all around just kind of see how it goes [Music] and if you get bleach on your shirt or your hands um because it does leads a little bit just wipe it on your shirt because it's cool all right so i went ahead and did a couple of the shirts i'm gonna turn them around and do it on the back um this process takes about five to fifteen minutes obviously the hotter the sun the quicker it turns and because you had the cardboard box in the middle it doesn't go onto the back and then you basically just do whatever you want so yeah i mean pretty simple [Music] so while you guys are waiting you know just soak in the sun [Music] wow all right you guys are awesome for hanging around so here is part three of sublimating shirt bleaching a shirt and then cutting out the neck design the arm so once it comes out of the washer and dryer you don't need any kind of detergent nothing like that it's going to look like this so pretty much it is ready so if you don't want to do the extra designs and don't just do your thing but so it is ready to go so what i'm going to do is i'm going to show you what i did so go directly across and you could make it as big as a hole as you want um or neckline it's still your choice so this one actually went a little bit deeper so cut all the way across so it's definitely off the shoulder i'm gonna do sleeves now and again just stay around the stitching [Music] boom [Music] and that's it thank you for watching make sure you guys like and subscribe this is my first official diy video so hopefully we'll have some more here pretty soon bye [Music] do [Music] do [Music] you", "EeAWjlOIA-M": "that I just spent $400 to find the perfect white t-shirt for you I did what's up guys my name is Marcel welcome to my youtube channel one dapper Street today is gonna be all about the white t-shirt a lot of you guys have shown interest in white t-shirts and I went out and found 12 of the best white t-shirts that I could find not all of them look the same there's differences there's small differences but there is differences and we're gonna take a look at those we're gonna talk about price we're gonna talk about fabric we're gonna talk about fit some of us like color differences in the whites and lastly about the styling of the shirts everything except for this one right here is available online all the links are down below for you guys to shop so I hope I can help you guys find the perfect white t-shirt for your style today the t-shirt that I want to start with is the one I'm wearing right now and it's from a brand that I believe is a fan favorite when it comes to white simple t-shirts and that's Uniqlo this is their dry packaged t-shirt for five dollars and ninety cents I honestly love this it's a really great fit nice and slim and even throughout the sleeves they just hug the arms nicely there's no excess fabric it or not standing off it's honestly an incredibly versatile t-shirt that we're starting with you're gonna see the other ones are a little bit more specific when it comes to the styling this doesn't have any particular styling there's no pocket no special seams no nothing straightforward it's a little tiny bit see-through it's a 2 to 1 cotton to polyester mix while pullies not considered one of the most high-end fabrics this is where you get your low price point and it really still feels comfortable I actually prefer this over the regular supima cotton t-shirt at unique Ledet I think a lot of you guys love I think this is more affordable for one and it fits better and feels better in my opinion let's put it to a quick test and see how easily it wrinkles if I do something like this right now we have some wrinkles but if you kind of just shake it up it works really well which is something I am looking for in a white t-shirt because I want to be able to like sit down and Ike not have to worry that it's gonna be super wrinkled because the fabric is a little bit too stiff but this I think is already in terms of versatility really really far ahead just because of the styling the quality of the field and cost so a great start with the first one but let's shake out number two this t-shirt that I'm wearing right here it's from H&M cost me $9.99 and it's from their divided collection the divided collection is the one that's a little bit on the lower end of the hmm quality but I personally really like this we're gonna start talking about the styling with this one because it is a little bit more special than the first one we have a pocket on the left chest and then the sleeves are actually rolled up and stitched up which is look I really like I don't have to worry about ruling them up I don't have to worry about making it look clean or making sure that they stay up so that for me is a big big thing the fabric itself has a little bit of a pattern to it so you see like a little bit of a stripe like a Marling I like that it is definitely a more particular look so this shirt is a little bit less versatile I think then the first one from Uniqlo that we looked at but if your style is a little bit more casual and you're planning on wearing this with a bomber jacket or a leather jacket then I think this might be a great way to go it feels really nice it's a little bit more breathable than the first one and nice and stretchy the fit just like the first one is awesome it's a little bit longer than the first t-shirt we looked at also playing back into that casual vibe but overall for me this is another great option but you see that there's just different t-shirts that might work for you better and that's the point of today's video so I'm excited to show you the rest of it t-shirt number three and back to Uniqlo I was throwing a little bit of shade on that supima cotton t-shirt the regular supima cotton t-shirt that is but this is a pima cotton t-shirt from their unique lo u collection back selection plays a little bit more with silhouettes and there's a little bit more fashion forward rather than your basic basics so this fabric is a little bit of a stiffer feel to it which makes for a nice and clean look but it's a little bit rougher against the skin I personally don't mind it or having that added hmmm I don't know ruggedness of the t-shirt the cost is $14.90 which i think is reasonable for a high quality t-shirts the pima cotton is amongst the best cob and you can get and the fit like I said is a little bit more boxy a little bit less slim you see that the sleeves are a little bit more roomy first Uniqlo or ii am sure that we had looked at which is fine because this fabric is stiff i won't have any trouble rolling up the sleeves and actually not having to worry that they stay up there because it's a little bit stiff and it keeps up nicely I actually have this t-shirt in my closet and I love it I wear it a whole lot and I think from a versatility standpoint it works just as well as the first one there's a little bit more fabric and it feels a little bit more rougher which is great for those days with maybe just a little bit colder outside so you actually get a little bit more warmth from this the color feels a tiny bit more natural so not like a bright white but a little bit more relaxed which actually makes it a little bit more versatile in my opinion easier to combine with other pieces the fourth t-shirts were back at H&M at a price point of $14.99 this t-shirt has a lot more surface interest it's a little bit like a sweater I believe this is called a pique knit I don't know don't quote me on that I did go to fashion school but it's been a while I like this it's definitely more of a choice it's not as easy a white t-shirt to just wear with everything this to me feels a little bit more elegant just because of the structure of it overall the fit is a little bit more roomy for me personally for this fabric I wish it was a little bit more slim more like a polo shirt but without the collar the sleeves feel nice against the skin it feels okay it's a little bit rough I would prefer to go if I'm going for a rougher t-shirt I prefer to go for the Uniqlo you honestly but I want to show you guys this so you also know that if you are into things that are a little bit more special and a little bit more elaborate you can also get a white t-shirt that is more interesting than just a white t-shirt and that's what I wanted to include this guy today from H&M s collection wait I keep forgetting about the wrinkle thing so let me wrinkle this up really quick ooh that's that's looking deep deep wrinkle it's a fairly structured shirt so that will happen so this is not ideal like it might wear out a little bit but even then you see that the fabric is a little stretched out and let's do the same thing to the Uniqlo shirt from before not too bad you see a little bit of it but it's better it's very better I think than this white t-shirt right here moving away from HTM and unique little we're at Urban Outfitters now where you have this t-shirt for $29 this is what we're having a big difference in the styling of the t-shirt it's a long line t-shirt with an asymmetrical hemline which means that it's longer in the front than it is on the sides that is a very particular look if you're into that that's awesome I think underneath the hoodie I always like this look because it Peaks out and makes it a lot more interesting that's why I like long line t-shirts in general the feel of it is nice the quality doesn't feel super-high I feel like the I feel that seams on the shoulder rubbing just a little bit and for me the one thing with these t-shirts has always been that the sleeves I don't love the way they look they're just a little short and the fit doesn't particularly work for me I usually have to end up rolling them up a tiny bit and then it works better but this for me I like these t-shirts for particular looks but it's not super versatile in my opinion even the neck is a little bit more of a scoop neck so you're showing a little bit more you guys know urban outfitters and you know the vibe they're going for so this is their in-house line which is obviously reflective of what the brand's aesthetic is so this is just a little bit more casual and a little bit more extreme wrinkle test [Music] yeah not that great I think it again it feels like the fabric stretched out a little bit you barely see the fabric but like from my point of view you see a little bit of like the stretch off fabric which makes sense because there's a lot of stretch in here and like I said the quality doesn't feel that crazy high so that makes sense to me next up we're back at H&M but this time we're looking at H&M edition one of their higher and collections and this is an entirely linen made shirt which I really like what that means it's gonna be a little bit more see-through because it's linen has a little bit of a rough feel against the skin but like the good kind of rough feel that you'd expect from linen that might sound a little weird but you know there's differences in linen and sometimes it feels comfortable just like you feel it a little and sometimes you're just scratching your skin this does not it feels nice the fit is somewhat relaxed but this is a relaxed t-shirt I think for the summer this is amazing something for the beach and more beachy look something more relaxed for your everyday usage obviously it might not be ideal since it's not cotton and cotton is one of the best fabrics for like everyday wear the color of it is also just a little bit more natural because you'll often find that with linen fabrics you don't get that clean white which i think is beneficial it just works with the more natural look of linen and usually we know Lynn and wrinkles pretty badly so yeah you can kind of still see it it's not it's not ideal but for a linen t-shirt it actually works out pretty well so that's oh very out there option I think this is the most out-there option that we have in terms of fabric today while looking at these 12 teachers almost halfway through but stick with me because I went in the stores and tried all of these shirts on for you so you don't have to all you have to do is watch this video seventh tee shirt is from Topman but not from the top man brand it's actually someone rents that they stock that's a European brand called selected home and ironically it says on the back of this t-shirt the perfect tee you know what in my opinion like I'm giving away a little bit of like the rest of the video in my opinion this this really could be when it comes to straight-up versatility it's 100% cotton t-shirt price at $35 we're getting into like a steeper price range but this is where you really want to look out for quality so you can justify spending that much money on a t-shirt it needs to hold up over a while and it needs to feel great and this feels great the fit is phenomenal the shoulders are hitting for me exactly where they're supposed to we once again have the nice and slim arms and a nice slim fit throughout the body the fabric is just a tiny bit see-through but it feels amazing it's just a very it's not a clinical white it's just a tiny bit off but it feels phenomenal and this is I think to me the most versatile t-shirt that I've had on so far I've probably also will have on it is very close to the Uniqlo t-shirt the very first one and that's a $30 price difference so depending on your budget I say you could probably go for this because there's not a big difference but I really really like the small tiny little differences in this one for me personally last thing wrinkle test at this point I don't even know anymore I feel like you've looked at so many wrinkles what do you guys think all right I can still see it a little bit just imagining if I was sitting in a car driving for a little bit it's not that bad obviously what I'm doing with them with my hands is also pretty extreme but I feel like it'll bias not because I like the shirts I'm trying to say it's not wrinkling that bad now we're moving into the $45 price range and we're inside of cos stores at that price point you're going to want to see something that's special about the t-shirt that justifies that extra money going towards a simple basic t-shirt in this case it's a cotton t-shirt 100% so the fabric is not what makes it special but costs it's focused on basics but then it's taking a little bit more of a contemporary spin on them so in this case we have heat bonded sleeves and a heat bonded hem which take away two seam that's one thing that you're gonna notice but also because it's double layer you see like a little white blocking around here and around here which is a cool little feature if that's something you're into another thing it allows for is rolling the sleeves up really nice and neat because there's a certain structure to that heat bonding that allows for that to look clean the fit is a little bit more boxy again in line with that contemporary vibe that cost stores has going on I personally don't think it's gonna be one of my favorites just because $45 is pretty steep and the versatility with this is a little bit limited in my opinion the feel is interesting like the cotton feels a little bit more dry than the other ones which is not necessarily a great thing our last thing I feel like that's worse than some of what we see isn't it maybe it's just because the rest of the fabric looks super clean so when it is steamed or ironed it looks great but the wrinkling I'm not personally super convinced about just because it stands out against the other cleaner parts of the t-shirt but I have one more from cause that I want to show you guys right now and this is it it's also $45 and it's also 100% cotton but with this one you can probably easily detect that it's all about the fit so looking for the perfect white sheet this one is for you if you're into a larger silhouette if you like oversized things and if you like a little bit more of a non-classical so hood a modern silhouette that sounds way better than non-classical we got really nice and roomy sleeves and obviously a roomy body as well the length is not as long as I thought it may be for something that's literally denoted as oversized or I think it's called the long t-shirt on the cost website but the quality of the cotton feels great it's heavier than the first one that I showed you guys and very similar to the unique loss of pima cotton t-shirt and last thing with this one yeah similar judgment as with the last one I think the rest of the shirt looks so clean when it's properly aren't that this will kind of stand out once again a little summary for me it might not be my everyday t-shirt but for you it might be if your style is a little bit more relaxed three more to go on the next two are gonna be from all stains both of them priced at $60 this shirt is surprisingly similar to the shirt that we just saw from costs the color of the white is a little bit more natural which I once again think makes a little bit more wearable the silhouette is a little bit less extreme as the cost one I think this is easier to pull off than the one I was wearing just before is it worth fifteen dollars more I don't necessarily think so if it's right up your alley and great for you then that's awesome but I wanted to include it because I do like it I do like the roominess of it I do mess with the fit like I I think it's fun when you have a little bit more fabric you can also have more fun with the styling and I'm about to release a video coming up really soon styling a white t-shirt we're gonna focus on a simple one but if you guys need some outfit ideas for white t-shirts I got you covered it's coming up really soon after you find your perfect one I'll teach you how to style it as well but again back to this t-shirt I like it it's also not the one I would go for if I'm going for versatility for my personal style before we take a bite of this one first pretty well on the wrinkle test the fabric does feel nice against the skin it's a little dry but comfortably so it's fine by me let's take a look at the other All Saints t-shirt and this one to me is a lot more classic All Saints it's slimmer a little bit elongated nice and slim sleeves we got a slim neckline and I've seen a lot of people with the alsace t-shirt with the logo on it I like that they also have a clean version I don't like any logos on line t-shirts personally it's just a preference but the fabric is super soft it feels great it's a little bit more see-through which also goes back to that All Saint's aesthetic of being a little bit more rugged and rock and roll I think like it just works great under a suede trucker jacket or suede biker jacket I think that we or a biker jacket can also be leather this is all surprised at $60 and like I said $60 we're like in a price range that for a white t-shirt really needs to be worth it if it's you're selling you are a little bit more rugged and you can't swing it because you love All Saints brand then that's great otherwise I think we have a couple options in here that I might opt for before I spend $60 on an All Saints shirt finishing up with a big note on comfort that's what you're paying $69.95 for with this Tommy Bahama t-shirt I walked into that store because I had a Tommy Bahama t-shirt in my closet that I loved I was trying to find it if it's still available but I found this instead and this is the only t-shirt I would actually prefer to have a size smaller than because it's just too roomy I decided to include it anyway because you have no idea how good I feel right now in this t-shirt it's ridiculously light it has a cooling technology in it it's a mix of 42% pima cotton 25% Modell 25 percent poly and then 5% spandex spandex just means it does this and it feels amazing now the the size medium can definitely work support some more grungy or street wear looks because it's definitely oversized the like you can tuck it in a little bit but I would for this t-shirt go for its size small that's really where you guys have the choice to make whether you want to spend $70 on a t-shirt because it's amazingly comfortable and it might keep you cool also I again I bought this yesterday I don't know how cooling technology works in this t-shirt that they apply to the fabric but I'm excited to put it to a test and even for a beachy t-shirt like it's almost like an active wear t-shirt a little bit in terms of the styling the shoulder seam is just dropped about an inch board so you see it a little bit more prominently also adding to that more active wear aesthetic and then we have these little finishes on the side of the seam which I honestly could do without not gonna lie to you but I wanted to show you guys this because it's just it feels amazing so great wrinkle test with this yeah that's what I figured with this fabric you can almost not even see that I just wrinkled it which is amazing so this is definitely about comfort a great teacher to be traveling in a great teacher to just be hanging out and if you're you know worried about feeling phenomenal and that's it man that was a mouthful just talking about white t-shirts for I don't know how long this video is by now but I hope you appreciate the effort that I put in for you guys I went through all the stores and tried all those shirts out so you don't have to and I hope you found whatever is perfect for you like I said all the links are down below for you guys to shop let me know in the comments section which ones you didn't like the most you know what you're looking for in a white t-shirt I would actually like to know because like I said I have my two favorites yeah but I want to get a conversation started thank you guys so much for watching I'll see you very soon with the next video until then stay doctor bye", "BiSYoeqb_VY": "Consider the classic white t-shirt. Annually, we sell and buy\ntwo billion t-shirts globally, making it one of the most common\ngarments in the world. But how and where is the average\nt-shirt made, and what's its environmental impact? Clothing items can vary a lot, but a typical t-shirt begins its life\non a farm in America, China, or India where cotton seeds are sown, irrigated and\ngrown for the fluffy bolls they produce. Self-driving machines carefully harvest\nthese puffs, an industrial cotton gin mechanically\nseparates the fluffy bolls from the seeds, and the cotton lint is pressed \ninto 225-kilogram bales. The cotton plants require a huge quantity\nof water and pesticides. 2,700 liters of water are needed to produce\nthe average t-shirt, enough to fill more than 30 bathtubs. Meanwhile, cotton uses more insecticides\nand pesticides than any other crop in the world. These pollutants can be carcinogenic, harm the health of field workers, and damage surrounding ecosystems. Some t-shirts are made of organic cotton\ngrown without pesticides and insecticides, but organic cotton makes up less than 1% of the 22.7 million metric tons \nof cotton produced worldwide. Once the cotton bales leave the farm, textile mills ship them\nto a spinning facility, usually in China or India, where high-tech machines blend, card, comb, pull, stretch, and, finally, twist the cotton into\nsnowy ropes of yarn called slivers. Then, yarns are sent to the mill, where huge circular knitting machines weave them into sheets \nof rough grayish fabric treated with heat and chemicals\nuntil they turn soft and white. Here, the fabric is dipped into\ncommercial bleaches and azo dyes, which make up the vivid coloring\nin about 70% of textiles. Unfortunately, some of these contain\ncancer-causing cadmium, lead, chromium, and mercury. Other harmful compounds and chemicals\ncan cause widespread contamination when released as toxic waste water\nin rivers and oceans. Technologies are now so advanced\nin some countries that the entire process of growing\nand producing fabric barely touches a human hand. But only up until this point. After the finished cloth \ntravels to factories, often in Bangladesh, China, India,\nor Turkey, human labor is still required \nto stitch them up into t-shirts, intricate work that \nmachines just can't do. This process has its own problems. Bangladesh, for example, which has surpassed China as the world's\nbiggest exporter of cotton t-shirts, employs 4.5 million people\nin the t-shirt industry, but they typically face poor conditions\nand low wages. After manufacture, all those t-shirts\ntravel by ship, train, and truck to be sold in high-income countries, a process that gives cotton \nan enormous carbon footprint. Some countries produce \ntheir own clothing domestically, which cuts out this polluting stage, but generally, apparel production accounts\nfor 10% of global carbon emissions. And it's escalating. Cheaper garments and the public's\nwillingness to buy boosted global production \nfrom 1994 to 2014 by 400% to around 80 billion garments each year. Finally, in a consumer's home, the t-shirt goes through one of the most\nresource-intensive phases of its lifetime. In America, for instance, the average household does nearly\n400 loads of laundry per year each using about 40 gallons of water. Washing machines and dryers \nboth use energy, with dryers requiring five to six times\nmore than washers. This dramatic shift in clothing \nconsumption over the last 20 years, driven by large corporations\nand the trend of fast fashion has cost the environment, the health of farmers, and driven questionable \nhuman labor practices. It's also turned fashion into the second\nlargest polluter in the world after oil. But there are things we can do. Consider shopping secondhand. Try to look for textiles made from\nrecycled or organic fabrics. Wash clothes less and line dry\nto save resources. Instead of throwing them away\nat the end of their life, donate, recycle, or reuse them\nas cleaning rags. And, finally, you might ask yourself, how many t-shirts and articles of clothing\nwill you consume over your lifetime, and what will be their combined \nimpact on the world?", "fVJWMmDwH50": "We're talking about the Next Level 100%\nring-spun cotton long sleeve t-shirt. This is one of our favorite long sleeve\nt-shirts for a few reasons. First off, is the price point, it fits great into any budget and for just a\nlittle more expensive than a hundred percent cotton Gildan, you get a much\nsofter shirt. The colors, there aren't as many options as maybe the Gildan one,\nbut they're awesome because they're very standard. Instead of just telling you about the shirt though, about the fit and everything we do have our model. He's gonna come over and basically show this thing off. The first thing you're gonna notice is it does fit great, very tailored side. We have a seam right here that contours to the body just like every Next Level\nt-shirt. Next let's look at the neckline. The neckline on this is, it's bound on the inside, good stretch, a hundred percent ring-spun\ncotton. Just an awesome neckline. There's not too many special things about the neck on this shirt because it's just a standard crew neck. The sleeves though, awesome thing to note here, they're not baggy. How many of us grew up with a long sleeve t-shirt? Maybe you got it in sports and they're super baggy, you know like you think, who did they make this thing for? how many people are they fitting in here? No this shirt looks like it was made for Tyler, right here. Another thing is the sleeves. Normal long sleeve shirts have a big cuff this shirt basically just has a seam right here, so, there will be pictures on our site that you can look at for this but it's one seam right there so it's not a thick cuff. Great for pulling up it's just an awesome sleeve it doesn't feel heavy and as structured as other brands. If you compare this to the Canvas hundred percent ring-spun cotton one, you're gonna find that this one maybe feels a little more like an unstructured shirt a little more casual. I also love the\nring spun cotton in this very soft. Over the course of a good amount of washes it\nwill maintain its softness too. So, if you're looking for a great hundred percent ring-spun\ncotton long sleeve shirt. It fits a great price point, comes in awesome colors and a great fit. You look awesome in it Tyler. Thank you. On the Coed Monkey Soft Scale we rate this t-shirt a two. Thanks for watching this  video please let us know if you have any questions because here at Coed Monkey, Soft Matters and so do our customers.", "zwQbjZrJcLo": "[Music] setting everybody boy big brando and today let's talk about one of the mistakes i made when i was trying to pick out blank t-shirts now let me start this video off by saying if you've watched my videos about blank t-shirts or if you watch any of my videos or ask any questions in my live streams and you ask what's the best blank t-shirt to use i always say it's a personal preference when it comes to the best now the reason i say this is because i learned this the hard way now about 10 12 years ago something like that i was launching a brand that brand i wanted to offer the best quality t-shirt money could buy i wanted my brand to be top quality i wanted everybody to be like hey check it out man this is top-notch highest quality you're gonna find that's why you gotta shop with me the issue i had was my idea of quality wasn't what everybody else thought was quality i just thought a soft feeling t-shirt was top quality at some high quality if the cotton is that soft you know what i mean i was thinking all right this t-shirt right here super soft this is high quality four dollars a blank this is the real deal this is what i'm getting so i order in bulk you know what i mean i'm ordering i think 18 dozen t-shirts or something like that for this first run like let's get this going have these really soft hand feeling t-shirts ready to go i'm screen printing all these t-shirts these aren't transfers this ain't nothing else this is regular screen print now that i think about it this is probably like 15 16 years ago because we're in 2021 right now it's about maybe 15 16 years ago so i get these t-shirts in i'm screen printing i'm getting them going man everything is going good i feel good i feel confident in my printing i feel confident in the t-shirts i feel very confident in the designs i got on here and i'm ready to go but this is where i messed up the people i was selling to they don't give a about that soft feeling t-shirt they wanted a thick heavy feeling t-shirt the designs i had were home runs to this audience the t-shirts i were printing on wasn't even a strikeout we weren't even playing the same sport at that time you know what i mean the t-shirts were so far off from what the customer actually wanted so i sold a decent amount of t-shirts on that first run right i sold a good amount of t-shirts and i'm feeling good and then i noticed nobody else is buying all the sales stopped nobody's buying and i can't figure out why i have high quality t-shirt i have really good prints and i have damn good designs on these things what's the hold up and the holdup was me thinking that this soft t-shirt was high quality and i'm advertising it as high quality but the people that were buying the shirts didn't think that was high quality because we had two different ideas of what quality was to me at that time quality was soft hand feel cotton to my consumer quality was a heavy weight t-shirt that was cut a little longer and a little more baggier so now i was stuck with i think like 10 to 11 dozen t-shirts of these super high quality soft cotton t-shirts that i could not sell because i was selling to the wrong people the people i was selling to had a different idea of what quality was and i didn't understand that at the time because i'm thinking this is high quality man the t-shirt you want those things are crap because that's only a two dollar blank these are like four or four fifty a blank this is high quality cotton the other stuff you want is just some cheap swap meet style cotton but to the consumer those swap meet style t-shirts was high quality because that's what they wanted heavyweight t-shirt boxier cut a little more baggier longer sleeves i didn't pay attention to all that because this shirt was a little bit more fitted it was shorter but it was soft as and i just thought soft as meant the highest quality money can buy so i lost on all of those t-shirts i lost this is where things get up so now on my next run what i do is now i'm buying the heavyweight t-shirts that those customers wanted but i'm selling to a totally different group so now my thing is all right high quality means heavyweight t-shirts this is what everybody wants this is what everybody needs but now i'm selling a t-shirt that's geared towards like the people that are into wearing like ed hardy and stuff like that this is how far along this is is the people that were used to wearing those types of t-shirts were into the softer thinner feeling t-shirts but i was offering these heavyweight t-shirts because my research that i did was saying soft isn't in baggy heavier feeling cotton is what's in and that's high quality so now i'm buying these heavier t-shirts selling them to the wrong crowd because now i have these really cool designs that are on these heavier t-shirts and i'm promoting them telling them it's high quality they buy it and they're like this t-shirt sucks it feels like a swap meet t-shirt i don't want this t-shirt and then when i look at what they're used to wearing it's more of a softer fitted cut it's a little bit more thinner it's a little bit lightweight and not necessarily these big heavy t-shirts so once again i lose out and i lose out big because i'm offering the wrong t-shirt to the wrong customer so when people hit me up and say what's the best t-shirt to buy it's personal preference because everybody has a different idea of what the best is what quality is everybody has a different opinion on it so some people out here in la might think pro club is high quality that's something that they're used to wearing that's something that they like but if i tried to offer this heavyweight pro club t-shirt to let's say i'm running a fitness brand and now i want to offer pro club t-shirts to people that are into fitness and wearing these shirts to the gym hell no they want shirts that are tight hugging the sleeves they want lightweight soft feeling t-shirts those are two totally separate t-shirts but both high quality in their own respected space see what i mean so there's no one blank that's the best above all that's made for everybody everybody has a different preference on what t-shirts they like so when people hit me up and say hey man what's the best shirt to buy what's the best blank t-shirts to use and i tell them it's all personal preference they get mad because i'm not giving them an actual brand to buy their shirts from because if i think pro club heavyweight t-shirts is quality and that's the best t-shirt to use and then you buy pro club heavyweight t-shirts because you're going off my recommendation but your audience is into fitted t-shirts or they're into lightweight t-shirts or ring-spun cotton t-shirts you didn't say all that and i recommended pro club to you because you asked me what i think the best quality shirt is who is in the wrong me because i gave you my recommendation or you because you went off on my recommendation and didn't understand what type of t-shirt you were buying so you would waste a shitload of money going off of my recommendation instead of going based off of what your customers want and need because my idea of quality is really really not going to be your idea of quality i base my idea of buying t-shirts off of convenience how fast can i get these t-shirts where can i easily get these t-shirts because think about this say if you wanted to offer bella canvas t-shirts right a certain model number from bella canvas is your idea of the best quality t-shirt so you order these you're using these for your brand you're going everything is moving let's say it is friday night and you're pressing up some orders and you up two of those shirts you're all out of that color you're all out of that size where can you go on saturday to buy that same exact t-shirt if that same exact t-shirt isn't offered around to you locally then you're in a bind because now you have to place an order wait till monday or tuesday to get that order so for myself i buy based off of convenience i use all style and pro club because all style and pro club are easy for me to get my hands on around los angeles i could go to my liquor store i could go to the swap meet i could go to the t-shirt warehouse i could go straight to the distro warehouse for pro club or all style and pick stuff up on my own i personally can buy these t-shirts one by one or in bulk anywhere around me that's why i use these certain brands is it because they're the best is it because of it's the best highest quality no all it is is my idea of convenience is a big part of how i buy t-shirts because i'm thinking of if i these shirts up i need somewhere to go to buy these t-shirts and re-up so i can still get that order out on time because i don't want to have to be like oh you know what i'm running behind i'm waiting for these t-shirts to come in so now the customer has to wait on me now if i mess up a t-shirt the customer does not have to know that i messed up on a t-shirt so if i mess up on a friday night i know saturday morning i could go to my indoor swap meet i could go to the t-shirt warehouse i could go to the liquor store on the corner and buy another pro club or another all-style t-shirt bang it out i'll pay retail for it but i'll still bang it out to get that order out so that's why when people ask me what's the best t-shirt to use i usually say it's personal preference and then when they want to know what brands i use and i say pro club and all style i always tell people order some samples first see if you like the shirt before you even place that order because these t-shirts work for me and my customers i got a customer base that only loves pro club i also have a customer base that only likes all style if i tried to switch the two i would lose customers on both ends because the all-style customers hate pro club pro club customers hate all style so i have to know who i'm selling to and what i'm offering this is exactly what you need to do for your brands and your businesses is knowing what the customer is used to knowing what the customer is used to wearing knowing what the customer likes and doesn't like so that way you don't buy the that they don't like and you can make money because the goal is to waste less money to make more money do not waste a ton of money buying blank t-shirts thinking that's what your customers need or that's what you like or that's what you want to offer then your customers like man these t-shirts suck now you're stuck with a bunch of t-shirts that you can't sell don't do that this video helped you out make sure you leave it in my comments if you got any questions make sure you leave them in the comments because i get a lot of dms and emails all the time and it's hard for me to filter through

a few months ago i told you guys that i was going to be trying to sublimate onto cotton and to the best of my knowledge to best of my limited amount of knowledge the only way you can sublimate onto constant cotton is if you have a easy subli setup with your sg500 easy sub ink package or if you buy some solution that is available on etsy and available on amazon amazon links down below for that solution also i'm an amazon affiliate helps channel out a lot when you use my amazon link anytime you shop and buy anything on amazon just a side note give this video a thumbs up again so um guys i went ahead and i purchased this solution from amazon right and this is what i got i got this right here in the mail this is what i got all right um and i'm gonna show you guys what it looks like on the amazon um uh the amazon page this exact thing that i got and this is what came in the mail okay yeah that's all i'm gonna say about that so needless to say it took me a little while to get to the point to make this video because i had to get a spray bottle because oh terrible does not have a spray bottle so i finally got my lazy butt together and i got a spray bottle from walmart and we're gonna pour some of this into here and we're gonna go on to vexels.com and pick out an easy design and print it out and see if we can submit it on a shirt using the solution on a cotton 100 cotton shirt and see how it comes out guys so let me say this again i'm also a vexel's affiliate for those of you guys who want to purchase a membership to a website that offers unlimited amounts of images

start pouring this stuff and um see you know spray it onto shirt i know you got to let it dry for a little while actually i don't know anything because it just came like this with no instructions so let's just pour it in here all right let's get this started guys please excuse the ashy hands had to go over to the rental property and um change my my tenant had an issue with the hot water heater there was a um there was a hose disconnected hot water heater that um had a hole in it so squirting out water a little bit of water so i had to uh get a new hose from lowe's and replace that no problem easy fix oh look at this this fits perfectly nice i like it when it's perfect like that what's up dub nation hit that like button when you get a chance so guys now we are just going to go ahead with our pre-treatment of the shirt we have 100 percent poly what am i talking about we have a hundred percent cotton gildan shirt right here we're gonna pre-treat with this solution handy-dandy solution that we purchased um a good idea would probably be for you to get a lint roller and roll all this stuff off but i'm not going to do that we're just going to do it like as if uh a worst-case scenario type of thing to give you guys a full idea of what would happen just gonna try to get the hair off though so it's already shaked up we've shaken it up already good we're just gonna try to um oh we gotta put this on spray okay there's a single mist off and there's our misti mist with the three sprinkly lines things all right so we kind of want to spray it on evenly kind of sort of it's kind of weird a good thing would be is if you had a roller but we're just going to spray it on and latches i think that's should be enough i don't know and we're just going to let it dry all right i think we gotta let it dry i'm not sure because this thing came with no instructions came just like this so we're just gonna lay it over our sublimation printer to dry for a little while while we go to our next step guys for those of you guys that use this before let me know if i'm doing it right because i really don't know but um it didn't come with instructions so this is just like this video is just like if one of you guys would have got it in the mail and you guys are just going along trying to figure it out right common sense you have to get a spray bottle and spray it on so i think you got to let it dry that's common sense you wouldn't press something that's wet so let's move on to the next step if you're new to the channel and you haven't subscribed yet please hit the subscribe

you guys a little short story real fast so pay attention okay the other day a company named ouidro contacted me on instagram and they actually sent me out a pair of their 300 dollar premium step rails for the 2020 jeep wrangler unlimited for those of you guys who have jeep wranglers and are interested in step rails like the ones that i got from ouidro then i'll put the link down below so you guys can my amazon affiliate link down below so you guys can purchase yourself some of these step rails it was a really really easy install to be honest with you guys if you know if you're a little bit savvy about um about tools and things like that you know how to work way around just nuts and bolts that's it it's just bolt-on easy no cuts had to be made or anything i did it myself in a parking lot the other day i'll also put the link right here as a matter of fact of the video of me installing the whole thing so you guys can check it out it's on the other channel subscribe to that channel by the way but um it was an easy easy process and i got to tell you guys i was i kind of did not want to change the um the the step rails but now that i've had them on for a little while i really really like the look of the aftermarket step rails and i'm glad that i went ahead and took them up on their offer and got those step rails installed on my 2020 jeep wrangler sport unlimited guys more upgrades to that truck is coming up is coming up because we have big plans for that truck i was supposed to do some stuff this summer but due to cover 19 everything just fell through and it's ruined our plans as far as you know the whole audio system with the microphone and everything those you guys don't know about that look in the channel um in the other channel and you guys will see all the upgrades and stuff that i did to the jeep and more upgrades to come like i said so guys this heat press right here this heat press right here you guys saw the review that i did on it and all the things that i didn't like about it and the more and more i use my godzilla press which we're not pressing on today we're using our regular craft press plus whatever the heck this is called that i really more and more dislike to be honest with you guys i do not recommend you guys um buy this i would much rather you buy a walleye press from heat transfer house which i should get one to demonstrate it for you guys matter of fact i will get one to demonstrate for you guys because why not um if i'm gonna tel um advise something that that's a worthy purchase for you guys i should have it in front of you guys to show you all right so stay tuned for that while i press coming up but they're always sold out they're really really good presses heat transfer house link down below anyway i'm always saying i feel like anyway guys um i really feel like the more i use the godzilla press with the auto open feature this 15 by 15 is even though it has a slide out drawer it's just not it anymore guys it's just not it anymore i'm going to suggest it if it's in your budget if it is in your budget and you um are in the market for uh your first heat press that you just go ahead and buy an auto open press or save your money just a little bit longer and go ahead and buy the johto on a heat transfer house that's that's a good auto open press solid build and i think that's what we're going to switch to guys i think i think this is going to go bye-bye and we're going to get the jodo press if we can get a 15 by 15 because they're always sold out too because they're extremely extremely good presses um so we'll see what happens all right let me let this thing finish heating up and we will do our test i'm excited are you excited you should be excited so while the heat press is heating up i went ahead and sat the shirt on to the platen because it's still a little bit damp and i think it's supposed to be dry i'm not sure but i'm just going to go ahead and hover a little bit hover shout out to the hover squad it's going to go ahead and hover and if that does anything um it should help it dry so yeah just hover a little bit and i'll be right back after it's heated up aida productions so now our shirt is dried bone dry to the max so now i'm going to go ahead and put in my one layer of butcher paper let me roll it up a little bit like i always do pardon the hand guys i should get you guys another angle but this will do i don't know what happened right here i got a little something right there on there on the shirt but it's okay because we're just doing a test put that butcher paper up in there up in here nice and flat all right grab my first llama all right slide this out because i don't want to start heating up all right now we're going to go ahead and put this llama on here like so boom good enough looking good feeling good line up sideways yeah it looks good all right put this at the top slide it in we're going to do a 60 second press on it 20 second 24 second mark guys and because i do what a lot of youtubers don't do of course we're going to waste a shirt i know it's going to come out crappy but we're going to put a one of the limas on a untreated shirt just so we can compare the two for those of you guys who have never seen what it looks like to sublimate onto 100 cotton untreated all right go ahead and let this thing up boom all right let's see what we got here okay didn't get caught that's good look at that he already it's kind of like stuck like sticky okay i'm actually i actually i hold on now guys let me do the other one first aida productions hannah i'm kind of uh surprised now kinda surprised kinda pleasantly pleased to be honest with you i am pleasantly pleased let me go ahead and roll this up i'm gonna get the other one ready just so you guys know that there is a difference between using that substance versus not using that substance all right so what i did was i sprayed it on there the downside to um having to spray it on yourself is that you're not you can't with a spray bottle get an even coat of of of that material on there so they do have something available that's like a kit keep on forgetting i got the slide out it has a kit where like you can spray it on and no roll it on and it rolls on evenly i know that's available on the market somewhere i've just never used it i think stan banks shouts out to stan banks have uh has i think he's used it in the video before but i don't have that available right now to me obviously so boom pre-press let's put on our second llama and we get you got to lay it on there because we pre tr press the shirt so it's already warm which means it's already going to activate the sublimation stuff lay this down on here slide it back 60 second press for this one aw productions some of you guys are going to purchase this stuff man i think some of you guys are going to purchase this stuff it's not that bad even though it didn't come the way it was advertised and feeling some type way about that but it's still you know we'll see 60 second press just to be fair i did leave the first press on a little bit longer so i'm going to leave this one on a little bit longer now we're going to bring it up all right and no sticky no sticky uh sound like the other one all right actually not bad either not bad either but let's compare the two guys let me get this heat press out the way so we can compare the two adap productions all right so let's talk about it let's talk about it let's talk about it you guys should immediately be able to see the difference in what's what 100 cotton non-treated cotton transfer still bright and vivid on the paper very very light on the shirt lightly transferred but nonetheless it did transfer personally i think that if you want to sublimate onto 100 cotton if the design calls for it i would think that if you want a vintage look and you guys would have to test this out and do it for yourself to see what i'm talking about i'm going to try to get some close-ups for you guys but i think it's very much worth still sublimating on 100 cotton non-treated that's what i'm going to say now whether it's going to wash off after one wash i don't know i would think that it maybe maybe not based off of the back i mean you could see that it did kind of go into the fibers but it's not as vivid as the treated shirt but if you want a vintage type of faded type of look which that might you know that might be a look that you want for a shirt i don't know but i think it's uh if you're going for that look that you could possibly still do this non-treated now let's go to the treated one and let's see uh the results and i'm gonna kind of have to give you guys a close-up of this because there's a lot going on with this all right so the first thing that's going on with this thing that i'll tell you guys i can see that even though it transferred better than the non-treated shirt i still have blotches blotches on the transfer where you could see like the spray that i sprayed on i guess that's why they make pre-treatment machines when doing dtg you know and even on the transfer you can see all the blotches from the uh from the chemical that we transferred onto the shirt and even when you touch the shirt versus the other shirt you can feel like almost feel like a stiff type of chemical on there right versus the one that was not pre-treated all right so um yeah still a lot on here not as much as this not as much as this one but still a lot all right there's still a lot of ink on here not as much as not as much as this one all right but if you ask me the faded look is a cleaner image it might be a lighter image it might be a faded type of effect of an image but it's still a cleaner image because it doesn't have these blotches in it so that's something to consider guys um but i don't know if you want to do this if you can think of a creative way to apply this stuff so it doesn't put these blotches on there which you guys are creative you can come up with something use a paint brush or something roll it on there so it's even i think that's what the system has it has a paint brush or something like that if you could use a paint not a paint brush but a paint roller and that will put an even coat on there you know maybe something that's not fuzzy or something like that something's cloth i don't know but um it could work let me know what you guys think what is the proper answer for the question when somebody asks you can you sublimate onto cotton is it yes because clearly you can very very light lighter than the treated shirt and way lighter than a polyester shirt but i don't know if the camera's doing it any justice but it's still usable you ever see like a vintage papa smurf shirt or something like that or my little pony something like that or faded it's usable guys i really think that this is fine if it's the look that you're going for you know it's light but it's still it's still usable i've bought shirts like this like the real soft light cotton shirts like almost thin that have that vintage type of faded look it's still useful it has its purpose now of course does this spray-on stuff work the answer is yes because it's bright it's it's somewhat vivid you can see the colors better but you have these little blotches which means you need to find a better way to apply the uh material or the liquid to your shirt guys so i hope this video was helpful hope it wasn't too long i hope i didn't talk too much which i know i did if i have to if you have

business and in this video we are going to compare the Bella canvas three zero zero one to the next level thirty-six hundred coming up right now [Music] what's up guys Gary edging a t-shirt help desk calm and we are getting into the ring all right Bella kam is three zero zero one versus the next level thirty-six hundred all right the tale of the tape all right these two blanks have a lot in common they're both popular styles they both run from size extra small to 4x now there are some differences between the size and how they run between Bella and next level and I'm going to get into that later in the video all right they're both cotton and they're both ring-spun but the Bella canvas is heirloom combed ring spun cotton it's different and I'm going to explain that later in the video they both come in a multitude of colors next level comes in about 30 different colors however Bella canvas comes in 95 different colors and they also have Heather's and different colors of Heather's they both have the tear away labels but there's some small discrepancies in that and I'm going to explain that later in the video so I have two colors for both styles and we're gonna get into that and let you see what we're talking about right now alright guys this is the Bella canvas valve 3 zero zero all right unisex style and I mean great shirt you've seen it all before it has the overlock stitching on the shoulder goes down and it has the side seam which really makes what a really nice fit it's not just tubular all the way around so let's show you the back I mean great shirt so this one right here is the next level all right and you see the back great shirt same thing overlock stitch is very very similar on the surface okay as the collar great collar is the back very similar on the surface to the Bela campus it also has this side seam alright so let's see what that looks like in red all right so this one is the Bela canvas in red okay great shirt right and all and you know we have the overlock stitch and a very nice collar and we're gonna go down to the same stitching on the sleeve now let's take a look at the back I mean great shirt great fit all that good stuff and of course you have that side seem very important because that helps the fit okay a lot of these things are tubular they just go around and this one is the next level these styles are somewhat similar all right all of those attributes when you look at them are the same the fit is a little bit different than nice collar the overlock stitching here's the back very similar on the surface alright so let's take a deeper look alright now that you seen those bad boys let's do a side-by-side comparison let's put them right on top of each other and let's see what we're working with here we go so right here we have the Bella canvas 3 0 0 1 and the next level 3,600 now these are both sides large and they both have the rip-away label now Bella canvas started doing the Ripper ways long before next level so some of the next level stuff you get may still have the satin for the woven label and also the next level as you can see the next level is the one in the back you can see how the shoulder comes further over in comparison to the Bella canvas and that gives it a a more boxy or feel the Bella canvas has more of a fitted fitted look or fit now that depends on your personal preference and what you want to do with your line all right and you can see that the colors are very similar but I used this red so you can really see this stuff a little bit better than on the black so you can see the difference you really get to see the difference when you actually try it on or put it on now the fabrication the fabrication they both use rings cotton LaBella canvas uses heirloom combed and ring spun cotton they comb out 20 to 25 percent of the initial cotton to create high standards which gives a clean nice print surface both of them have sizing from extra small to 4x Belair canvas is considered a true unisex because the smaller sizes are more tailored to a female towards a bigger size as a more tailor to a male another thing is next level is all made everything overseas Bella canvas garments are all dyed and cut in Los Angeles they have a huge manufacturing presence so if American May is important to you go of Bella canvas actually I have a video where I visited the manufacturing plant and there's gonna be a card in the description box and right here so you can click right up there and check it out alright guys that was cool but now this is where the rubber hits the road alright everything looks great everything looks awesome when it's brand new ok when it's as we used to say back in the day funky fresh out the pack ok when it's nice new and crispy but what about when you wash that bad boy a few times alright so now we're going to show you how it is after some washings okay here goes alright guys so I took these and I threw them in my little mini washer here because I wanted to go through the process because like I said everything new looks good but what about the process just like in our everyday lives when we get a t-shirt when your customers get a t-shirt they're going to throw that bad boy in a washing machine and wash it so the wear and tear of washing it just what do you get this is where you really how good the quality of your t-shirt is so I washed these a total of five times I ran them through the entire process five times and I'm gonna show you the end result alright that was the washing so let's see after they're all dry let's see the difference between five washings all right check it out all right and so after wash this is what we are working with for the next level and it's nice you know but there are a lot of loose fibers you know and the the neck looks a little bit worn after the wash you know it loses his shape a little bit but it's still a quality garment but you can see some of the loose fibers so you know just take a look at it you know this is after five washes all right this is the real deal Jimmy so just want to show you everything all right I mean nothing I mean when you wash something nothing is going to stay perfect this is what happens during the natural process of washing [Music] so this is the Bella canvas and one thing you're going to see is that the neck and the collar maintains is its shape and it still overall has less of the loose fibers and still you know maintains a little bit more of that fresh look I mean after washing nothing looks like what it did when it was first purchased all right but higher quality garments do have a tendency to maintain their quality or closer to the quality for longer so we just wanted to give you guys a really really good look at the both of these another thing to take into consideration is the Bella canvas three zero zero one is five cent cheaper than the next level 3600 so you're actually paying a little bit more for something with less quality [Music] all right guys conclusion they're both quality t-shirts okay in terms of fabrication and the quality that's put in it you know have to give Bella canvas the advantage but of course you know everything is a matter of choice and what you want alright the one of the things that really stand out to me is the fit and see this is the thing about fit is everyone wants something different if if you're into something a little bit more baggy and boxier you may want to go with next level if you want something a little more nice and really nice and you know fitted to the body and looks really good and what's happening right now in the industry I would definitely say go with the Bella canvas course after the washing I think that I mean they both look good the Bella canvas does have you know a slight advantage with the fabrication and that that nice smooth printing surface and it really has that you know that favorite t-shirt appeal you know how after you know you had a t-shirt for many of you wash it and wash it and just put it on and this fits I mean Bella canvas definitely has that appeal but once again it's all this stuff is subjective it's really up to you so that is my comparison I hope you learned something from this the one thing that is an absolute constant with every t-shirt business is the blank you have to have a blank t-shirt that's a very important and when you have your core target audience set up choosing a blank is very important and it's up to you to make the best choice you possibly can so you can get those customers to not only buy but to be repeat customers so make the best decisions anyway guys I am Gary a janae I wish you guys all the best cheers to your t-shirts remember do something good for somebody and if you don't have anyone to do something good for do something good for yourself so next time peace and blessings and I'm gonna put some butter on my shoes and slide on out adult god bless and I am out peace the Bella Candice three zero zero one to the next level thrift you [Music]", "wUUzTFq67SE": "hi welcome to septum 8 septum--ah is the newest product and being able to applicate on 100% cotton how do we do it we're going to show you so stay tuned you pulling it okay okay that's one and then here's the other so if you have problems like this the paper gets stuck you can wet it really good you know you don't want to go

you know if it if it does if it does stick a little the paper it's okay it with a little bit of wet water it comes right off and it does not damage your product in any way not at all okay you", "CYz4CtDCCrQ": "so today we're talking about the best t-shirts for working from home but I also have two thoughts that I wanted to share with you number one there is no such thing as the best t-shirt and number two and we can use a completely new kind of vocabulary to describe hand feel so you want to skip ahead fine go ahead timestamps in the description but I think this is actually really important see the problem is there is no best t-shirt there is no best t-shirt I spent $1,000 and I bought 17 different t-shirts from around the internet and I realized they're all different they all have different good things about them and asking what the best t-shirt is is like saying you know what's the best place to vacation well where have you been where do you want to go are you a city person you want to go explore nature do you want to see Tokyo and the culture do you want to let go and you know Baskin the rays of sunshine in a waterfall I don't know what do you want the exact same thing applies for a t-shirt is it the winter or is it the summer do you have sensitive skin do you like wool do you want to feel something that's vintage do you want some this all cotton we all have these idiosyncratic preferences and it's okay to have them so for this video I'm not gonna say there's one best working from home t-shirt I'm gonna give you a bunch of different options and then you decide I will tell you all about the myth of the everyday t-shirt and why there isn't a best t-shirt in different videos so click on the link down there or haven't made it yet so subscribe please now my second thought is this we need a completely new vocabulary for describing hand feel because every company now describes their shirts as soft and if every company uses the same word to describe a shirt then that word becomes completely meaningless it's like if you took Shaq and this curling athlete if the Metro got into sweet hog to make sure it maintains the speed with quiet time and you call them both Olympic athletes yes that's technically true but I don't think you've actually said anything in order to paint the most unique picture of each t-shirt and how it feels into your mind I will not use the word soft at all to describe any of these t-shirts so three qualities that I'm looking for and a work-from-home t-shirt number one comfort all right this one's obvious right I'm at home want to be comfortable and soothe and feel nice and relaxed and reassured number two not sloppy I want a t-shirt that has just enough presentable 'ti that I feel like I can go and do something you know it some good work finally thermoregulation the thing is in my home it can get really cold because my girlfriend is a ceramicist when she goes outside and she leaves and if i don't have to do that that'd be pretty nice unfit I'm a medium I'm 6 feet 160 something pounds slightly wider shoulders I'm like on the slightly larger side of medium and finally we are not affiliated with any of these brands we bought all of this with our own money so best 100% cotton is the lady white code there are like jersey for $55 the brand is chic la hipster so not bad lady white coat is my favorite t-shirt I've been wearing it every single day what I really love about it is it's perfect blend of being structured and having enough sturdiness and half miss where I feel like ok this is a real t-shirt versus descent there's a light like dream eNOS to it and we feel it in your hands you immediately know that it's a really high quality cotton and I love that so Comfort was my favorite thermal regulation though it's above average it's better than your average con t-shirt but I live in LA so it does really well for me if you're on the East Coast and it gets really cold fit is great you know uh it's not large it's not small I'm a perfect medium it fits me perfectly and if you want to have you weight and more vintage version they have another version of that on their website so if you like 100% cotton $55 like isn't too expensive for you then I would go with this one all right next up 100% cotton budget pick this is The Naked and Famous circular net t-shirts $33 they're an American denim brand that they're really into Japanese denim hashtag yellow fever is that you're funny do you think I should include that circular knit is when they knit the t-shirt so that they actually don't have a side seam which I guess it makes it a little bit more comfortable honestly I don't the difference but some people care also a mid-weight ring-spun cotton so it has a bit more of that stiffer durable you know hefty or kind of feeling to it which again if you like vintage teachers if you like that feeling of wearing a t-shirt t-shirt this one has that the thing that it's different from lady white coat is that it is less soft and aha I said soft it isn't as fuzzy or tender it's less dreaming so it's more stiff it is $32 it's like half the price it still feels really good and a little break in with a few washes so if you wanted a nice cotton t-shirt but didn't want to pay for Lady WIPO making famous is a good t-shirt to go with the reason why I have begun enjoying sturdier heftier t-shirts there is something beefy about it and there's something about its heritage because in the past teachers used to be sturdier they used to be a bit stiffer I just noticed that I wanted to connect myself to the heritage of t-shirts last the outlier ultra fine merino t-shirt for a hundred and twenty dollars so the outlier brand is for people who are really into clothing and they're down and pay more money for the highest possible quality that you can buy when people say the micron thing of wool they're basically referring to the diameter of the wool fiber so it's sixteen and a half that's just absolutely finest that you can go 18.9 prickly outliers t-shirt seven-and-a-half very very long furious I don't really feel the prick leanness at all but I will say I do feel it a tiny bit so if you have sensitive skin take that into account the hand feel is amazing though it's it's nothing that you've ever felt before it is luxurious it is buttery and as soon as you touch it it has this thickness that it drapes over your arm and if you really want to feel productive this shirt really works because the whole day you feel like you're wearing something that's just great heavily all over you also this is a large so size up and in thermoregulation the outlier rule t-shirt amazing if it gets hot you feel fine if it gets cold you feel fine it outperforms cotton by a huge margin a couple of problems with the outlier t-shirt number one is $120 number two it's so nice that I feel like there are times in which I want to take off my t-shirt before doing something like if I'm cooking and number three the main problem is the care you can wash it but they don't recommend it in the machine they tell you definitely don't dry it you have to lay it flat on a table to dry so like but if you like merino wool if you want something that's really gonna thermoregulation if you want to spend $120 if you want to take care of it the best merino teacher you can buy so wool blends I think are a good balance because you get a lot of the good properties of wool right you get the thermal regulation ice breaker you also get a nice silky hand feel right it's really wet it's like a perform it is a performance t-shirt and it doesn't have any of the prick leanness of what you would expect a little t-shirt to have and that's really nice but the other problem is is a performance t-shirt and I don't really like to wear performance teachers when I'm working but some people are totally fine with it my business partner Alan loves wearing silky athletic performance ET shirts to go to work you don't like the prick meanness of wool or if you don't want to take care of wool consider getting this winner in this category is cuts forty eight dollars sixty two percent polyester thirty-three percent cotton and 5% spandex they're a whole thing around this is that they called the hand filled buttery and you know what it is sort of I might even say it's a little velvety in a really good way it feels a little bit artificial and you know what you might not even notice a lot of people probably aren't going to notice I noticed that it's a little bit artificial that's doing synthetic fabrics no matter what it is trying to mimic the buttery hand feel to really really really expensive fabric but that's what it is it's it's an imitation the sleeves are a little bit tight and it has a curved hem I'm not really into that but you might be and that's totally okay if you enjoy synthetic blends and you like the butteriness of a good t-shirt that that hand fuel but you know you don't want to spend $100 for t-shirt this might be a good choice all right finally the X Factor t-shirt if you have been waiting for a silk cashmere t-shirt I've got the right one for you in the DOM $75 its silk cashmere oh my god it feels so cloudy and dreamy it is it's what you wish wool would feel like it when I wear it it feels like I'm just swept away on this cloud and taken for a joyride it might be one of the best t-shirts that I have ever felt in my life you have to hand wash it they say that I think they say that you can machine wash but they're very judgmental about it and I could not take that so I can't really recommend it for a daily wear unless you're the kind of person who actually hand washes their clothing I'm a 28 year old I can't do it that's really hot that's a problem hey we're gonna do more reviews and theorize about how clothing works so subscribe and/or check out our subreddit our slash merit store", "140vNQ3pDVw": ">> In this video,\nwe're showing you how to make your own\ncustom clothing designs. Surprisingly,\nall it takes is a little bit of bleach\nand some freezer paper. [Captions by Jeffrey D. at Y Translator] Here's what you're going\nto need to get started. You'll need a shirt\nor other article of clothing that is mostly made of cotton or linen. Other types of cloth may not\nreact very well to the bleach. A household iron,\nsome freezer paper, a spray bottle,\na razor blade, and of course, the bleach itself. I have here printed-out\none of the King of Random logos, and this is the design that we're\ngoing to put onto one of these shirts. To transfer this design from a piece\nof paper onto the cotton shirt, we're going to be\nusing our freezer paper. Freezer paper is just paper\nthat's designed to wrap stuff up before you put it\ninto the freezer. It's pretty much\nplain paper on one side, the other side\nhas a shiny waxy surface. When I first started\nresearching this project, I thought it was probably\ngoing to be better to just use something\nlike contact paper. Contact paper is a sticky clear sheet\nwith a backing that comes in rolls. I thought it would be\nreally good for transferring a stencil design\nonto a shirt. But it turns out,\nthere are some real advantages to using the freezer paper instead. Because one side of the freezer paper\nis like normal paper, you can write on it with pens,\npencils or markers very easily. Contact paper being plastic, that doesn't work so well. We're going to stick\nour freezer paper onto our shirts by using heat from an iron. And again, that's one of the advantages \nof the freezer paper, is it doesn't stick until you\nhit it with the iron. So you have all the time\nin the world to perfectly position it just where you want it. Combine that with the fact\nthat the roll of freezer paper is usually really big\nso you get great coverage. Which prevents\nover-spray onto your shirt. Let's tear off a good size sheet\nof our freezer paper and get ready\nto transfer our image. You want to take the design\nand place it face down onto the waxy side\nof the freezer paper. Despite the wax coating, a little bit of masking tape should do a great job\nof holding your design in place. Now you can see that with\na black printed design, you can see right through\nthe freezer paper on to what you're going\nto want to cut. To help increase the life\nof both your razor blades and whatever\nyou're working on, it is best if you have \na cutting mat that you can use. Now, how this is going to work\nis you'll cut out everything that you want to\nbleach onto your shirt. It's kind of going to be\nthe reverse image of what we've got here. I'll be using a black T-shirt\nand the bleach will turn it lighter. If you cut the design entirely\nout of the freezer paper, it may be difficult to keep\nall of the pieces aligned just where you want them. Small pieces will be harder to keep\nflat when you lay them on the shirt. For example, if I were cutting\nout this T and K piece which is all joined together, I would cut most of the way around it. But in the corners,\nI would leave a small piece where I don't cut. That will leave the design\nconnected to the rest of the paper until I'm ready to remove it. You may want to trace over your design using a pen or pencil \non the freezer paper, or maybe you prefer\nto just use your knife, and cut directly onto the pattern. Either way works just fine. Using a sharp knife \nwith a good point, carefully cut out \nall the pieces from your design leaving a few\nconnecting points so that they don't completely\ncome off of the freezer paper. With our design prepped,\nwe now need to move on to prepping the T-shirt\nto be ready to be bleached. Before you bleach\na new article of clothing, you want to be sure\nyou wash and dry it to remove any coatings\nthat may be on it. We now want to cut out\na piece of cardboard that can fit inside this shirt. That will both help it keep its shape, and prevent any bleach from getting through\nthe front onto the backside while it's being bleached. Since my cardboard does have\ngaps in a couple of spots, I'm just going to cover\nthose with some duct tape. [Music] Once you have your piece of cardboard cut to the right size and shape, fit your T-shirt over it. It's not necessary to have\na piece of cardboard that fills the entire shirt the way\nI have it on this one. It really only needs to be large enough\nto fit your whole design on it. But this way, I'll be able to use\nthe same piece of cardboard for any other design\nI do in the future. With the cardboard inside the shirt, you want to take your iron\nand press the whole thing down, so it is nice and smooth. This will help the\nfreezer paper stick to it better and your design\nwill turn out nicer. With the T-shirt nice and flat, it's time to position\nthe design on the shirt where you're going to want it. First, let's remove our pattern\nfrom the back of our freezer paper. Now we can position it\nright where we want it, and this part right here\nis why freezer paper is much better than contact paper. 'Cause for contact paper, it would stick as soon\nas it touched the shirt, and you wouldn't be\nable to reposition it at all. The freezer paper covers a pretty\ngood amount of the T-shirt, but it is possible\nto get some over-spray. The bleach solution could\ntravel through the air a little bit, and land on parts of the shirt\nthat you don't want bleached. So it's a good idea to make sure\nthat every part of the surface is covered. You can use some old newspapers, some additional cardboard or more freezer paper to do this. [Music] With the whole t-shirt covered, it's time to remove the pieces that we've cut out from our design, and expose the t-shirt underneath. Carefully go through your design and lift up the cut-out\npieces by the edges. If you've made your connecting point\nsmall enough, they should tear through easily. But if not, you can very carefully\ntake your razor blade and finish the cuts. Be sure you don't cut down\nthrough the T-shirt itself. [Music] Just to be sure that\nnone of the edges have peeled up so the bleach will get under them, let's hit it with the iron again. You may have noticed\nthat I haven't removed the second half of the design yet. And that's because\nwe're going to try and make this\nin two different stages, so we have two levels\nof brightness on our t-shirt. We'll use 1/2 bleach and 1/2 water\nin one of these little Spritz bottles. We'll also want to be sure that we have\nseveral paper towels easily at hand. [Music] Be sure you don't have any excess\nbleach on the outside of the bottle. [Music] With the mix of bleach\nand water in the spray bottle, you're now ready\nto spray it over the design. I really like these Spritz bottles because the evenly \ndistribute your solution without laying it on too heavily. If you get too much of it on, it can soak through the shirt, and down under\nthe edges of the design. So you really only want a light\nmisting on the surface. We want to dilute the bleach\nbecause chlorine bleach by itself is actually powerful enough that it can dissolve the fibers of the shirt. If you apply it directly,\nit can eat right through the cotton. We'll spray on our bleach solution covering all of the\nexposed parts of the design. And then immediately, we'll dab off all of the extra\nliquid with some paper towels. We do that to make sure\nit doesn't soak down into the cotton, and under the design, and to try and keep our freezer paper from getting too wet. If it gets soaked,\nwill have a very hard time pulling it off of the shirt later. In a matter of seconds,\nwe can see the effect of the bleach on the black shirt. It's obvious that some areas have received\na little bit more bleach than others. So we'll do a second layer\nand try and hit those darker spots more. Our first layer\nhas changed pretty well. Generally you can keep\nadding more and more bleach and give it a little bit more\ntime to react and it will\nget lighter and lighter. You have to decide\nwhat color you want. When bleaching a black shirt,\nit will usually start out sort of orange, and then as you get more\nand more bleach on to it, it will turn peach\nand then almost white. After a few separate\ntreatments of the bleach, the first half of our design\nis where I want it. Now, we'll peel off the right side\nand cover all of it with more bleach. That should leave us\nwith the left side being very light and the right side\nbeing sort of a dark orange. If you want a very light,\nalmost white color, it can really help to iron over\nthe bleach as it's drying. Be aware though,\nthis puts chlorine gas into the air. So you should never do it indoors, where you'll end up breathing the fumes. Once your design is to the\ncolor and shade that you want, it's time to remove all\nof the masking and stencil, and stop their reaction\nusing some cold water. The pattern doesn't look\nquite as good when it's wet. But after a quick trip to the dryer,\nit should look good as new. If you don't feel like using a stencil, you can use other methods\nto apply the solution onto the shirt. You can spray it\ndirectly from the bottle. Maybe flick some drops on with your hand, or even use a paintbrush. If you want to add the bleach\nto a lot of the parts of the shirt but just mask off\na few portions, you can use tape, and either cut out\nyour design from that, or just lay the tape down\nin the design that you want. Something else that's\nfun to do with these shirts is after you've stripped\nthe color out with some bleach, you can add a little bit\nmore back in if you want to. I have here  some alcohol based ink. This is basically blue\npermanent marker ink, and some rubbing alcohol. I'm going to add the rubbing alcohol\ninto the Spritz bottle and then several drops\nof our blue ink. At that point, we should be able\nto add that on using the spritzer to our shirt\nonce it's been dried. To test how much color we get,\nlet's try spritzing onto our freezer paper. We can see that the blue is very subtle. It doesn't change the color\ndrastically or quickly. That's better if you're \nspraying onto these shirts because if it's too concentrated, and you don't have your sprayer\npositioned exactly where you want it, the color is going to go\nin the wrong spot. Having a very dilute color\nas much more forgiving as you can go in and add little bits of color\nat a time until you reach the shade you want. YouTuber NightHawkInLight\nhad a video on bleach shirts as well. And in his, he had a shirt\nwith a rocket on it. I thought that sounded\nlike such a cool idea that I wanted to try on my own. [Music] As a reminder, don't store your bleach \nsolution in a plastic bottle long-term. The bleach could do damage\nto the bottle causing it to leak. This method of shirt designing is fast. It's fun. And combining a bunch\nof these techniques, you can come up with\nsome really cool stuff. Guys, there's still more\nfor you to see.

you want them smaller still you take your clothes put them gonna sink anything at all or you know anything that'll hold water boil some water on the stove in a tea kettle or a pot you know anything you have available once the water is boiling pour it over your clothes and let your clothing sit in the hot water until the water is cool once the water has cooled off be careful cuz the clothes might still be a little bit hot but wring them out just a little bit so you won't be dripping water on the floor before you take them to the laundry room throw them in the washing machine depending on how many clothes you have put the washing machine on whichever setting extra small small medium large you know depending on how many clothes you have wash them in the hottest water you can add your laundry detergent of course you know let them go through their cycle when they're done take the clothes out pop them in the dryer again on the hottest setting possible and pull them out and your clothes should be significantly smaller I am Rachel you choose this and that is how you shrink clothing", "i2YIDRhhM4Y": "[Music] yeah I might regret this when tomorrow comes with them drunk nights

"[Music] hey y'all it's stephanie and in today's video we are going to be testing a tick tock hat so i got this hack off tick tock it's making your own cotton sublimation spray um so the link to the video is down below but we are gonna be making the sublimation spray and i'm gonna be uh pressing it with and without on a cotton t-shirt and then we're gonna wash it a few times and see if it really works if it don't work you know and if it does then hey we got a new way of making sublimation spray without paying all that money because it's expensive but um if you like this video give us thumbs up if you want to see more videos like this one hit the subscribe button down below and without further ado let's get on into the video all right so for this video you're gonna need eight ounces of water um some polycrylic a protective finish you're gonna need two tablespoons of that i got this cup and this mixing spoon here and then of course your spray bottle [Music] so like i said i got this off of tick tock we're going to see how it goes we also need your sublimation print and your heat press or your iron so this was print on uh c88 and epson c88 with the sublimation ink and as you can see i divided it down in the middle and i got a spray and a nose spray now these lines right here those were on the picture already so it printed correctly i just duplicated the print the picture so we have both so this is going to be the shirt or the the image and of course you'll need your shirt as you can see this is a hundred percent cotton and this is what we're gonna be using so i'm gonna set this to the side you also need your um heat tape and some cover sheets teflon sheets stuff like that um to to press on so first things first we're gonna add our eight ounces of water to this cup now when they said do not uh shake it so we're gonna open this up we're gonna add our um our two tablespoons and then we are going to stir because they said whatever you do don't shake it make sure everything's dried off completely we got one two okay i guess i didn't need that plastic sun really oh and you're also gonna need a sponge um so i will go get a sponge here in a minute but let's go ahead and get this poured into here now this does dry clear um so you don't have to worry about that it's a perfect bottle i got these little bottles off at amazon they're cute huh okay so we're gonna go ahead and put that in there now let me go get a sponge and i'll be right back okay so we take our cotton shirt and we load it on our heat press now make sure that you have a piece of paper on the in between i'm just using a basic white piece of paper and i'm just going to put that in between the layers so that it don't the ink don't go through okay now let's even that out now we're going to press this at um 375 for a few seconds now what i'm gonna do is i am going to get my spray and i i'm going to spray over the area that has the spray so we're putting this down like this so we are going to spray over oh let's go ahead i know this is just a test shirt but try to make it as even as possible because i'm kind of a perfectionist all right so we are gonna only spray over half of it so we are going to put the paper down and where it says spray we are going to spray over oh like our sublimation spray that we just made and we are going to get that good we are going to take our sponge and rub it in like it says and then we are going to press that with the cover sheet for 20 seconds okay so now we are going to take it and we are going to spray it again all right we're gonna take that sponge and rub it in again she uses a sponge roller but we've got a sponge roller so we're just going to use a regular sponge piece of paper cover it or actually she didn't cover it and we're gonna press that for another 20 seconds to set it now that's all set now we're going to take our image and we're going to get it on there as even as possible grab our heat tape tape it down so that it don't shift on us and we're going to cover that with a cover sheet and then we are going to kick up our heat press to 380 5 and then once that's he done heating we'll be back and press it all right so now we're going to cover this with our teflon sheet and we are going to press this for 50 seconds go ahead and move that and we're gonna let it pull for a minute and then once it's done cooling we will be back to remove it all right so now let's take this off and you can already tell that the one side is more vibrant than the other so if you can see right here this is the same red as this is and this one's more vibrant orange yellow green blue and purple and so you can already tell that this side is more vibrant even up here you can tell that this side's more vibrant and this is more vibrant than this so now we will let it sit for 24 hours and um we will start washing it um tomorrow so look i was pulling out the paper from inside the shirt and as you can see this is the side where it didn't have any spray and this is the side where it had spray so the spray did catch more of the ink so and then i was looking at the shirt further and also on the inside of the shirt where there was no spray it even went through the paper and got on there see and the spray it on the spray side it didn't so and that went through the paper because you know we had the paper to protect it so it went through the paper and got on the shirt so there's already one big difference of with the spray and without the spray okay so now we'll let it sit all right so it's been 24 hours and as you can see this side's darker and then this side so we're going to do our first wash test we're going to throw this into the load of laundry we're going to throw in a gang pod and then we are going to wash this on a normal wash with warm water so we'll be back once we're gonna wash it and then we're gonna dry it and then we'll be back all right so as you can see this side didn't fade at all up to where our mark was all that side faded like tremendously it even got over here like this side didn't smudge at all see but if you look up here it oh hold on if you look up here where it smudged the ink ran and you could tell like where it knit and smudge and where it did smudge and as you can see like there's the red and that is supposed to be the red as well oh right there and the orange the orange so this side is completely faded and completely smudged so we're gonna do another wash and we will be back after it's dry all right so here it is and as you can see it didn't fade this was after a hot water wash so this side's good this side's faded a little bit um the only thing i would say is like it's a little more faded than it was from the beginning but of course i did wash it in extremely hot water so what i would do is i would just um cold water wash it and it should stay pretty good all right so this is after a third wash this was in just cold water as you can see the spray side is holding up strong the nose spray side has pretty much faded almost all the way away but yeah so uh this hack is stephanie approved i do recommend you washing it in cold water and hang drying it should you want to make sure it's this way just so it lasts longer um but i mean it works and as you can see it's not faded where i sprayed the solution so if you like this video give us a thumbs up if you want to see more videos like this one hit the subscribe button down below and thank y'all so much for watching have a good day bye", "Kdo13g_-AQc": "1 2018 MRMT Brand Clothing 10 colors V

you too sis and I'm gonna show you how to shrink a shirt for whatever reason you want to shrink a shirt the temperature of the water is gonna determine how small your shirt gets I've had a shirt come out of the dryer looking like a Barbie shirt before and I never got to wear it again it also depends on the material of the shirt if it's something that's a really like you know like a sweater material it's gonna shrink a lot faster if you just have cotton it's gonna take a little more to shrink it so boil some water on your stove after it's been boiling you want to bring it over and dump it into a bowl or a pan whichever shirt you want to shrink drop it in that hot water let it sit in there until the water goes cold really let it sit in that hot water after you do that if you wash the shirt on the hottest possible setting in your washing machine it'll shrink it even more and if you dry it for a long time in the dryer on a hot setting you should come out with the shirts it's about two three sizes smaller at least I'm Rachel you choose this and that is how you should make a shirt", "a-JPA3d-DtY": "what's up YouTube back again with another new video now for the past 2 or 3 weeks on my Instagram live I've been teasing this video idea and since then a lot of you have DM me like yo is that video coming out when's that video coming out and here it finally is Street where brands that use the illusion now this is not gonna be the roast session that I know a lot of you want but don't worry I do have a video that will be a little more critical coming out within the next month or two so be sure to stay tuned for that and basically where we should start this video is saying what Gildan is now Gilda is a clothing manufacturer based out of Canada that produces blanks so you got your blank tees blank hoodies crewneck sweatshirt etc etc kind of similar to like a Hanes Fruit of the Loom American Apparel but I wouldn't necessarily say that Gildan is completely bottom-of-the-barrel low tier in terms of quality but I also wouldn't put them at the top upper scale either but the big kind of thing with it is that they're really cheap in terms of pricing I think it's a dollar 20 to a dollar 45 per blank t-shirt and there are a lot of street wear brands that are really popular right now that have been using Gildan blanks and there is nothing wrong with that but when you look at their profit margins and like the way they price things you would swear that they're selling you something of an amazing quality when instead you're kind of just getting a lackluster basic product and obviously there are some people who are aware of this and don't care because - like cool hype I just want it - I don't care but there are other people who I noticed were not aware of this and they're like - yo what the hell is this I paid $200 for this and it feels like [ __ ] and that is not a knock - Gildan and it's not a direct knock necessarily at the brand either because I do know some brands are gonna be like well well we think our name is worth this motion therefore we shall charge this much but where the problem lies is some of these brands claim to be all about the youth and the culture of street wear but how are you all about the youth and the culture of street wear when you're kind of like putting out a free [ __ ] product in my opinion like you're using a $1 t-shirt right with the most generic basic logo screen-printed on and you're gonna charge another 149 dollars or more for that tee I just don't see the logic in that and I think that's where the main fault is is a lot of these individuals just they spew out all this [ __ ] like they're all about the kids and they're all about you know street wear in general but in reality it just seems like they're all about making a quick buck and never sending out your products so we're gonna start off with the first brand that comes to mind and it is anti-social social club often refer to as anti guild and Gildan Club or anti shipping shipping Club because a lot of people never get their [ __ ] now I totally understand when you start from humble beginnings you got to use something cheap because maybe you don't have the capital to start off printing your your design on a higher quality shirt but anti-social social club is pretty big now and to my knowledge a lot of people who are still buying this stuff tell me that it still feels like the Gildan stuff that they were selling a year or two ago and I mean I don't know maybe it's just the hype maybe people really like me but I personally can't justify that and I would like to tell people like I'm not trying to knock on anybody's hustle but if you're not sending your shirts out like you're already selling a pretty low-tier product with a pretty generic logo but if you're not even sending your product out as you can see all over the internet people are saying that antisocial social club doesn't even send their [ __ ] like the shipping is horrible the customer service is horrible so I guess the customer service is essentially antisocial maybe maybe that's like the whole stick with it but I just don't get it and I just think that's really bad on them because people I've seen people comment on their Instagram pages like yo how are you driving a McLaren but you can't ship out t-shirts to people so I don't know but if any of you thought that antisocial social club was something of like a high quality I would say it's not I've felt some of the stuff in hands and although I do say that their t-shirts are kind of not horribly priced I think they're 30 to 40 dollars and when you compare that to some of the other [ __ ] on this list that sounds like a downright bargain but when you consider that you're probably not going to get your shirt in the mail maybe it's not a bargain but anyway moving onto the next brand we have the pablo merch and what what else can I say the Pablo March essentially to emerge so I guess you can cut it a bit more slack because it's not like some dedicated brand for the most part and they sell their shirts for I believe forty to fifty dollars as well and it depends also with the hoodies and the long sleeve which are also gilding as far as I know and I don't know like I get it like in the past Kanye's used on hands beefy T's for watching the throne those were only like 40 dollars and there was more design element to them and I just don't want anyone to be fooled like oh I'm paying $300 resale for this stuff so it must be good no you're paying for high you're literally paying for high it's a one dollar t-shirt bro like don't get it twisted all that [ __ ] on [ __ ] on Aliexpress or eBay that people are like just printing their own [ __ ] it's about as close to real as the other [ __ ] because like I said it's just gilding tea with some pretty basic screen print it's really easy to replicate and although I'm not condoning making a replica if they're both killed in its kind of the same [ __ ] right anyway moving on to the next one which is V alone now a lot of people have been really mad with this because I guess they weren't originally aware and there are the alone shirts that can cost up to one hundred and fifty dollars and I've had a source tell me that the camo shirts are Rothko and the black teas are Gildan and then someone took a picture and put it on Instagram of one of the V lone pop-ups where there's a bunch of Gildan boxes like right behind the cashier or something we're just pretty [ __ ] hilarious now I know they can't prove that the V lone T's were on Gildan for the most part but based on what I've seen calcium in person I'm pretty sure those are Gildan blanks ID I know for sure the camo [ __ ] that they sell is Rothko which also is not really that expensive of a brand but hey I mean I guess profit margins are more important than the culture and next moving on to one that actually caught me by surprise now I do have to note though this is fear of God but fear of God does not use guilt in for all their stuff they do have the majority of this stuff is cut and so but there's a few capsule collections like I think it was like a LA or like a Celtics or some type of [ __ ] shirt as well as these other ones that have like Bible verses or something and apparently those shirts were several hundred dollars but they were gilded tees so I don't really understand like Jerry Lorenzo kind of portrays themselves as being more high-end but I'm sorry no high-end designer would ever use a one dollar one it's not even a five dollar blank like come on like it would be cutting so and I just think that's kind of [ __ ] because a lot of people think I'm paying this much this must be a great high quality item or maybe some people know oh I'm just paying for the name but when you have a lot of these designers or like these friends of rappers etc claiming to kind of be on that like Gucci level or just like on a higher level of design but they're selling you stuff like this because when they really did care about you or like their fans in general wouldn't they want to put out the absolute best product they possibly could especially when you consider everybody I just named like all these brands or all these artists or designers or like rappers whatever they all are rich now so even if from humble beginnings they had to use lower-tier blanks to kind of get their brand rolling they're all rich now they could up the quality easily but no like they don't want to [ __ ] up their profit margins so I don't know I just it puts a bad taste in my mouth knowing that there's a lot of these people that make all these claims that they're totally a hundred percent about the culture yet they do stuff like this so it kind of shows just because something is expensive does not mean that it is of a high quality and like I said before this is not a knock on their hustle but it is a knock on some of their ethics and some of the [ __ ] they spew on social media like don't believe just because they tell you their about this or their about that that's actually the truth like actually look behind the scenes sometimes and realize that these people don't give a [ __ ] about you for the most part and no this is not a knock on Jerry I'm not trying to go out anybody right now I don't want anybody to get this twisted but come on man like in general all of you have the ability to make something better but Niek in particular send your [ __ ] out bro like you're whipping MacLaren's and Ferraris like okay it's turning into a [ __ ] round now but yeah do like send your [ __ ] out to people get better customer service instead of buying all these [ __ ] cars and [ __ ] or at least just admit that your [ __ ] is [ __ ] like your customer service is complete [ __ ] but yeah anyway I don't [ __ ] with these brands anyway so I guess it doesn't really matter but I just want to let a lot of the younger kids know that a lot of shifts low-key not with the [ __ ] so yeah thank you so much for watching sorry it broke out into a bit of a rant but the real rents are coming pretty soon so make sure to stay tuned for those and yeah thank you so much for watching make sure to follow me on Instagram to keep up with the livestreams and peace out YouTube [Music]", "zCD_bssV4ak": "how's it going everyone we think it's really important that people think about wear clothing comes from and how it's made so today we're in India and we're going to go and meet some of the people that grow the organic cotton that gets turned into our t-shirts [Music] so here at Agena factory which is where cotton gets separated out with a usable part of fiber loaded so the guys are showing us here the end product of this process where the cotton seeds are pressed and this is what we end up with and it's used to feed cows [Music] [Music] completely closed the water recycling facility so the guys will eat drink [Music] when you make cotton about two percent of the material in the spinning factory ends up on the floor so we're going to go look around and see how this cotton waste we turn it to paper and that's the kind of paper we use in a packaging there for us [Music] what's amazing about that if it that's just high-quality is any other part that I've ever seen and it's just cotton and water when Perez arrived with us they're stored in a factory on the Isle of Wight and here for us are made in real time that means the printed in the seconds after their orders and because of that there isn't any waste [Music] this is the last stage in the process we're finished products are sent out to our customers but it's not the end of the journey because every product we make is designed to be sent back to us when it's worn out and we pay that material and ream manufacturer into new products that can be worn again new products like this remanufactured t-shirt that I've worn throughout the journey", "Hsi_lp0eyRg": "hello I'm cam owner of monument limited we print t-shirts in this screen srinting tutorial I'm going to show you how to print one of these t shirts without using one of these screen printing presses. Here's a list of things you'll need. One exposed screen, covered in a previous video to class 1 12 inch squeeze one roll of screen-printing case one can of spray Jack 100-percent cotton black t-shirts one heat gun one port of place splashes all inc 1 inch spatula one quart of emotion remover in a spray bottle spray nozzle and a 14 x 20 inch three-quarter inch thick for step one take the strength to use the tape to create a damn at all four edges where the mesh meets the screen frames then tape up any pin holes from the bottom perfect to think the screen use a spatula to scooping out of the container and spread it evenly below the image in the screen place your squeegee and the screen and set the screen inside for a light mist spray tachyon to the board and load the t-shirt grab the screen and place it over the shirt use the clamps to secure the screen and board to the tape step 4 time to make the print used to squeeze you to pull inc across the image maintain a solid consistent downward pressure to drive the ink into the shirt below 20 seconds asked to ensure good heat unclamp the screen from the table and lift it from the shirt step 5 carrying wave the heat gun over the image security inc plastisol in needs to hit 320 degrees to achieve a full cure we don't have one here but another alternative is to use your home oven set it to 330 degrees throw that shirt on a cookie sheet and stick it in there for 30 seconds you'll have a perfectly cured shirt ready-to-wear one of the easiest ways to make sure you got a full cure is to do a stretch set of tracks that means that area didn't get cured fully I'm gonna hit it with you one more time step 6 time to clean up great whatever residual energy can out of the screen also placing it back in the container then apply the emulsion remover to both sides of the screen let it sit for three to five minutes and then scour that puppy with scrub pads to loosen the emulsion from the mesh use the water hose and spray the flat side of the screen and so the emulsion is fully washed away now we're going to use the behavior degreaser that we used in our how to make the screen video to prep this thing and get ready for our next coat of emotion thanks for watching the bid if you liked it punch the thumbs up subscribe and share with your friends if there's a tutorial you'd like to see me make leave it in the comments", "amLhr_KLrXA": "so David we're

flattered let's go didn't decide the shirt comes with the shirt or the watcher stretches stretches yeah Jackson stretchered but you won't see any visible cracks afterwards it to put it on a dark part yeah no crackle wallah and it's super soft but you can see video in the hands very good", "Nf0Luh35YXw": "[Music] hey guys it's me again says alene and my friend with a nice dress so today in this video we're gonna show you how to do an all-over t-shirt sublimation using app Xpress m110 just like my shirt size here so let's get started so the first step is to measure the t-shirt that you will be something making on and then prepare your chosen design from any imaging software will be a little bit shorter track or something else [Music] so in this all-over sublimation we actually used Cuba eggs it acts as a self sticking ink to prevent ghost printouts on to the textile whereas the generic sublimation inks use sticky type of paper which actually costs more technically you don't really waste textile and paper when it comes to Cuban eggs secondly Cuba inks reduces the smoke while sublimating in comparison to sublimating with traditional inks so the experts m110 actually has an adjustable pressure system you can either tighten or loosen it depends on the material you will be subletting on [Music] [Applause] [Music] so in this all-over sublimation we actually used Cuba eggs it acts as a self sticking ink to prevent ghost printouts on to the textile whereas the generic sublimation inks use sticky type of paper which actually costs more technically you don't really waste textile and paper when it comes to Cuba eggs secondly Cuba inks reduces the smoke while sublimating in comparison to sublimating with traditional inks more importantly the ink transfer rate is almost at ninety percent and its color output is more accurate the Qi ink is much more beneficial compared to traditional inks so lastly Cuba sublimation inks are highly pigmented therefore it is less consuming compared to generic inks thus it saves you money and you save the environment [Music] [Applause] [Music] so the extras m110 is deemed an all-over solution for an all-over sublimation because of its advantage on its heat plates in size which is 85 by a hundred ten fifty meters and it smelled door type flat face thus you have to control over your all over sublimation and the pressure system since the Xmas Edmonton has actually the adjustable pressure system so there you have it guys if you want to know more about the experts m110 this amazing machine we attack scrap are actually done a previous video so you can actually go through our YouTube channel at text raff and like and subscribe and happy some be and if you also want to know more information about that all over sublimation but just like what I did on my shirt so do visit www.texasback.com thank you [Music]", "tOZiNkbNUbI": "it's always been our mission to find new\nways to make some of the softest tees as humanly possible well we just launched\nour new sueded tee that makes our already soft fabric even softer so what\nis the sueded tee tee and what makes it feel so amazing it all starts at the\nthread level with our Airlume combed and ring spun cotton we created an\nincredibly smooth surface by using long staple cotton fibers and eliminating all\nimpurities once our heirloom fabric is knit and dyed it goes through a special\nfinishing process to get that sueded hand feel the fabric is run through a\nsueding machine with ceramic tip bristles that pull out tiny fibers to\ncreate that peach fuzz feel when you run the fabric surface over this bristles it\ncuts and tears and pulls millions of tiny little fibers out of the fabric\nthreads and it creates a really soft even hand there is no chemicals involved its just a mechanical operation the ceramic tipped bristles something unique to BELLA+CANVAS are what create that sueded face of the fabric without causing pilling of\ncourse printability is incredibly important so we tested multiple\nvariations of this sueded fabric until we landed on a version with both the\nsoftest hand feel and the best print ability so LETS PRINT LA was one of the\nprinters that was given a sample of the suede fabric to print and some of the\nthings that we were looking for was the evenness of the sueding right we've\nprinted on tees before that haven't uneven sueding and so what happens is when\nyou're printing to the hand feel it's a little uneven you can definitely tell\nthe difference one thing that we're also looking for is just the fibrillation\nthere's been other sueded T's that we've used in the past where the sueding\nprocess isn't even throughout the shirt and so some of it is raised a little\nmore than another and so with this one as we were printing we found there was a\nconsistent print across the tee every time we didn't have to prep our inks\nwith any additives or do anything outside of the norm to get a nice even\nconsistent print we did the same thing we did for any\nother 100% cotton tee and the results were great if you're looking for a\nhigher quality retail tee the sueded tee is something that's gonna give you a\nnice soft hand feel which is gonna help elevate kind of your brand and that kind\nof that market that you're looking for it's softer than anything like it on the\nmarket so you'll have to feel it and see for yourself Be Different", "HLyFIEzJUxA": "what is up everyone my name is Charlie with char media and today I'm going to be going over the top 4 best blank t-shirts you can use for your clothing line today so let's get to it [Music] alright so coming in at number 4 on my list is a brand called all Sal now when I started my first clothing line I use them first and I can honestly say that they are a great starter brown and what I mean by that is there are there are other brands on my lists that are going to beat them out but the great thing about all style is they're not that expensive and they have several different styles to choose from which is always good when you want to really create a brand that has tons of different shirt colors like if you wanted heather gray Heather black white and all that stuff I know a lot of the brand's you would think would have all these colors but believe it or not some of these brands actually lack color so all style has a great selection to choose from they are great on price I think I remember paying around anywhere from four to six dollars per shirt and the more shirt to buy keep in mind the better the price gets and I I think I typically ordered around 40 shirts so the price wasn't bad even ordering for t-shirts so anyway all styles a great starter brand and that's why they're number four on my list alright guys so third on my list is a brand called Delta now I actually used them right after all styles so I switched from all style to Delta and I can honestly say I really really like Delta I had a great experience with them they even sent me some free sample shirts before I ended up purchasing several different orders from them but they have really good feeling shirts and when you put them on you feel really comfortable which you don't really get from a medium to low range shirt you know like a high range shirt would be American Apparel or something like that so Delta really held up as far as quality goes now the one downside I will say about Delta is they don't fit true to size and that really really ticked me off when I was buying shirts I didn't know that at first cuz the shirt that I bought actually ended up fitting quite nice so I didn't really think that I would need to worry about the sizing or anything like that but um a lot of my customers were saying that they didn't fit true to size so I would have a girl buy a small and she said she needed an extra small now but she normally wore small so anyway I had a lot of complaints about them not fitting true to size so that is one downside to Delta but if you guys can just keep that in mind it's really not a problem you just order a little bit more you just order one size above what you normally order and that's completely okay or just stock every single size and that would fix the problem as well and then let people know on your website that they fit a little small but other than that they fit great the ink really stayed in the shirt really well even after a months of washing the shirt I noticed so that's another good thing and the price isn't bad as well it's around the same as all style and like I said the prices could have changed so you have to check their wholesale account on their website but that was number three on my list and I definitely recommend you guys check and Delta out because like I said they are a brand that I've stuck with for a very very long time alright so coming in at number two on my list is a brand called American Apparel and I'm sure you guys have heard of them because they're very popular but the bad news is they are definitely on the pricier side I've actually bought a few of them and I can tell you right now they're definitely more pricey than all the other shirts I've used for my clothing line but the good news is they are very good quality so that kind of makes up for the more expensive wholesale prices and another thing is they're very popular so people might want to buy your clothing line more because they know that you print on American Apparel because chances are somebody that's buying one of your shirts has already wore a American Apparel shirt so they have that confidence already built up but other than that I think it's a great shirt too if you can get past the price and all that stuff I would definitely recommend going with American Apparel especially if you really want that quality the one downside that I see with them and this is just my preference is the shirts do feel a little thick on and that's just something I'm not a big fan of and they're a little more fitted than I would like them to be but I like my shirts a little bit bigger like I wear a large but I couldn't fit a medium you know so that's just my preference so if you can get past all that I definitely recommend them alright guys so coming in at number one on my list is a brand called Toltecs now this is literally my favorite brand to purchase wholesale blank t-shirts from and the reason why is because they literally have one of the best quality t-shirts I have ever worn in my life and the price is great as well so to me in my opinion this is the goat sure for any clothing line no matter if you're one of the BigDog clothing lines or one of the startups it does not matter this brand is literally the best so definitely Toltecs is number one because I have not only used them before but I've had so many customers tell me that they love the shirt the way it fills and the just the quality of it and everything like that and also the ink stays in the shirt really nice so you don't you know after a few washes the inks not going to look all shitty or anything like that so anyway it is literally one of the best blank t-shirts you can buy and that's why it's number one on my list so that does it for this video guys if you liked what you saw today please consider subscribing if you haven't already and don't forget to hit that thumbs up and also let me know what kind of brands you guys like to print on in the comments section below and I will see you guys in the next one thank you so much for watching", "Qh4gaFnFsc4": "1 2018 Men T

heat transfer vinyl often but haven't had the opportunity to press heat transfer paper while the differences are clear between the two in that heat transfer paper can print full multicolored images with a single sheet of paper there are still some technicalities to keep in mind for instance what is the difference between light and dark heat transfer paper is there paper specifically for inkjet or laser printers or how about sublimation I'm a Stephan with the oppressed nation and I'll be covering such questions and more details about heat transfer paper that will give you a better idea of what options will best suit your needs if you're joining us for the first time be sure to subscribe and click the notification bill to be the first to watch tutorials streams and more from heat press nation if you're looking for details about heat transfer vinyl check out our video guide on HTV which you can watch right now by clicking the card above now let's get started heat transfer paper is intended for use on garments or other substrates with cotton cotton blend fabrics or synthetic fabrics as polyester nylon and lycra transfer paper can permanently transfer onto these substrates thanks to the polymer film able to bond the ink and fabrics together it is available in the standard u.s. letter and tabloid sizes of respectively eight and a half by 11 inches and 11 by 17 inches as mentioned earlier using heat transfer paper can bring full-color graphics of multiple layers down to a single sheet making the process of pressing detailed images much easier and efficient than before while some papers can transfer with no visible background or whitespace foremost we recommend to either cut paper transfers by hand or use the contour cutting feature of a vinyl cutter also known as printing cut let's go back to our first question what is the difference between light and dark heat transfer paper more specifically why are there two kinds of heat transfer paper available for printers light heat transfer paper is designed for pressing on white or lightly colored fabrics while dark transfer paper is for pressing onto black or darkly colored fabrics considering that printers do not need white ink for printer like heat transfer paper uses the white or light color of the fabric as a substitute well dark transfer paper prints like normal paper using the white of the paper itself hence why Sommer named opaque due to the way light transfer paper is transferred images must always be mirrored before printing them but this will not be necessary for dark transfer paper prints whether you are transferring on mostly light or dark garments or whether you use an inkjet or laser printer be sure to always have the proper heat transfer paper ready for your garments and press your transfers firmly moving on to the second question there indeed is heat transfer papers specifically made for inkjet and laser printers inkjet transfer paper is best for any inkjet printer at home or work likewise for laser transfer paper with laser printers these papers are specific to their printers as inkjet transfer paper is designed to hold wet ink while laser transfer paper can only hold toner with the inkjet heat transfer paper being as simple as either light or dark paper laser transfer paper is further divided into single or full color and white toner papers single color laser transfer paper is compatible with both light and dark garments while full color paper has separate light and dark offerings similar to inkjet paper white toner laser transfer papers are unique in that they are specifically made for white toner laser printers typically printing transfers in one or multiple colors alongside having the ability to self read the background or blank space of the printed image for both inkjet and laser transfer paper we recommend to use the best available quality settings for printing but keep in mind that over saturating the ink will cause it to bleed upon washing and weight after a day before washing any garment just press with either transfer paper and do not dry clean the garment lastly right after pressing any inkjet and single or full color laser transfer we recommend lightly stretching the transfer on garments to build up its softness and durability so far we've covered what heat transfer paper is available for inkjet and laser printers but did you know that sublimation papers are specifically for sublimation printers such as those from Sawgrass Rico and Epson this is due to the unique ink of sublimation which will print a solid form of an image which can then transfer onto a bright substrate through a gaseous state when you press with this in mind we advise against using any sublimation paper on basic inkjet or laser printers the sublimation papers we offer for sublimation printers are text print are for gel based ink alongside text print xbh are a water-based ink bold papers are compatible with any sublimation printers such as the Sawgrass SG 400 or SG 800 make sure to choose the paper compatible with the ink currently in the printer if you would like to learn more about sublimation visit our sublimation page to watch our guide video and browse our selection of sublimation products all in all if you are frequently pressing detailed images or graphics onto garments or other substrates heat transfer paper can deliver the results with full-color on just a single sheet even being limited to basic inkjet or laser printers still leaves you open with the opportunity to print with inkjet or laser transfer paper just find the paper compatible with your printer and light or dark substrates and remember that white toner laser transfer and sublimation paper will require different printers if you were interested in pressing with heat transfer paper soon we offer sample packs for both inkjet and laser printers with a three sheet variety of around 18 to 21 sheets of paper for both bundles essentially giving you a platter of transfer papers to try printing and pressing but we hope this video has introduced you well to heat transfer paper and if you enjoyed it be sure to LIKE subscribe and click the notification

that's pretty true to size it fits great in the body it's a little bit shorter on the arms and I would usually wear but it's not too short at all and the neckline is really nice as well it's not too tight it's not too loose kind of somewhere in the middle the material is a hundred percent bamboo which gives it this quite cool texture it also feels really soft on its really comfortable to wear it's all really well stitched as well with good double stitching here on the sleeves comfortable stitching around the neck clean lines down the side and double stitching again on the bottom the one controversial thing about this t-shirt is that it's got a stitch that goes down the middle and the back is scooped and slightly longer now these things both look great but stylistically it's worth keeping in mind if those are things that you're into there's really nothing to fold this t-shirt that's super comfy it looks great so I'm giving it a nine point eight out of ten this has been another review of thief by", "zbNXx4iLiIE": "[Music] hello and this is tom with the father's workshop screen printing and we're back and listen i want to spend a few minutes that maybe you have questions nobody's put anything in the comments but do you have you seen let me ask you this have you seen all this going on with the bleaching the sublimation on the shirt and the bleaching do you understand the process i'm not saying do you know how to do it do you understand the shirts that you should use to do this do you understand what type of shirts to use and what types of shirts that you use but you may have to treat some shirts before you do it you follow what i'm saying in other words you'll notice that a lot of these folks that are doing it are using the heather shirts because the heather i believe if i'm not mistaken they are a 50 50 blend now you say what is that that's 50 polyester and 50 cotton because you notice that they're not treating the shirts with a [Music] with a spray [Music] they're not using a d sizer and as a matter of fact um die press does not put that put that out anymore from what i understand now they use the poly t plus this is the this this is the the dye pressed poly t spray um and this is the this is the uh die press d sizer this was put in the white and gray shirts to take the the sizing to take the sizing out of the shirts and the sizing from what i from what little bit i know about it has to do with the um keeping the threads from breaking during this process and manufacturing i guess uh and making making up the uh the material and it keeps it from breaking so therefore that is in the material now you take a shirt like this you notice it's a gold shirt all right you say does that have sizing in it no it doesn't because the sizing was taken out when the color was put in so it went through a process to where they dyed the shirts therefore there is no sizing in the material because all the sizing was in the material at the time i think it was being woven and it kept kept the threads from breaking uh made it i guess it made this i guess it made it stronger as they if they did did it now if if i'm not right on that somebody let me know but i do know the sizing is put in there uh and it was for breakage i heard it was for um to keep the threads from breaking and i'm assuming that was in the process of being being woven and put put in and then after uh after it went through that process the there was the i guess it went i don't know how they do it i haven't watched the videos on how they put the color into the material but i'm sure the big big rolls and all that stuff went through a process to have the sizing taken out uh the color put in and however all that works and if i'm not right on that forgive me but i know this that the sizing has to come out of the shirt the sizing has to become come out of the shirt um in a way that the poly t that the the um the the poly resin can get on the threads and absorb into the threads and therefore be ready for your sublimation ink now do you understand how the sublimation ink works it doesn't work like regular pen ink or regular other inks it doesn't work like that sublimation ink works like this the ink itself when it is is is applied um you know it'll go on your paper just off your printer just the ink will go on there it'll go on the paper like just like anything else but the ink in itself for it to leave the paper to go into the material has to work under heat now you say oh well that just loosens it up right no what happens is that ink it breaks into a the form it breaks into a gas when it breaks into that gas it adheres to that material so what you've got is you have your material that has been treated it's polyester all right the more polyester the better the ink is going to adhere to when it breaks into a gas and it goes in that material the more polyester the brighter and and better adherence it's going to be in other words it's going to stick to it and as it sticks to it when it goes into the washing machine it'll stay on there be like putting it on 100 polyester and when you get that vibrant color that just kind of pops out at you you like the way i do that pops out at you when you've got that it grabs your attention because it's nice and it's pretty and it's the colors are just there but if you don't what happens when you wash it out it doesn't pop out at you it just kind of it's bland it's dull it's not and if you're doing these shirts to to sell to customers listen to me you gotta let the customer know because if the customers get the shirt and they throw it in the washing machine for the first wash and next thing you know they have a dull shirt they're not gonna be happy with your work because you may have made it look really nice at the beginning but once it's gone through the wash process what's it gonna look like if you want a good looking shirt make sure you've got a shirt that either is 100 polyester a 50 50 blend that has been treated with a poly resin to to to go in there and uh if you're using white or gray shirts you know that you i have the um the sizing that's in the shirt that needs to be taken out that you need to take that out or treat it and so you can put your uh polyester resin in there and spray and and get the shirt ready because if it's cotton if it's cotton it has no poly unless the shirt was made unless the thread was made with polyester and cotton or sometimes even a tri-blend so you have to watch that because these folks that are doing these um bleach videos on the shirts with sublimation they're using a 50 50. a lot of what i see is a 50 50 blend and therefore when you put the sublimation into that shirt it doesn't really pop out until after it's bleached but the bleach is not going to affect that ink because that ink is not like the dye and and everything that is in your shirts it it is a heat transferred from from from the ink to gas to into the shirt it's just the way it works and when it does that it's on the shirt so like i said they're not using just 100 first and to treat the shirt and get get the uh get the polyester in there um the the polyester resin and then get the subluxation ink on there and then do the bleaching because you want to do you want to treat the shirt first get all that done go into it uh unless you decide to bleach the shirt then after bleaching the shirt and get done you wash you you get it you know you got to put it in water to stop the bleaching process and get all that out of it and then bring it back and then maybe place your image on top of that but then what what do you got to do you mostly probably need to go ahead and on that 50 50 blend you've got all your your bleaching done okay so you got a shirt just bleach with no photo on it go ahead and treat it with you know dye presses poly t plus use that once that's done being treated and stuff then you go ahead and you can put your um photo on there and when you put the photo on there it's going to come out nice and vibrant and looks good and uh you know it's it's going to probably be there like it's supposed to be so you got a different way of doing it there's different nobody is an expert at this so you guys that are out there saying i have i am the only one that has the way to do this no there's lots of ways to do it all right and when you do it you just got to make sure you do it the way and this is where you experiment all right you're not a big manufacturing company where you're putting these billions of these out a day you're like everybody else on youtube trying to get along you you showing folks how to do things on your craft you get monetized you make a little bit of money which helps out pay some of the bills i know a lot of stay-at-home moms and things like that you know the housewives while they're home they help they make a little bit of money with their little craft stores and things like that sell on etsy and ebay and all that little stuff and the husband comes home from work and the wife has been working there as well as taking care of the home and the children and sure enough you both made a little bit of money to where you can pay the bills just like everybody we're just hard-working americans now that i've gotten off my uh pedestal let me get back down here and explain that that when it comes to doing these shirts you have to understand the process you have to understand cotton has no polyester unless it's a 50 50 polyester cotton blend all right if it's 100 cotton your sublimation ink you it'll go on it i have done it i have taken sublimation uh and put it on a white shirt and it it came on there pretty all nice and pretty and everything the only problem is once it went to the washing machine it turned out really really dull and it was not the picture that i first put on there it turned out to be dull why as i said before it has the sizing in it and it does have any polyester so when the ink when the sublimation ink turned into a gas and adhered to the materials it just adhered to a cotton material that would not hold um would not hold the picture and so it washes out it dulls so understand a little bit about this before you start doing it because if you got 100 cotton t-shirts and you want to bleach them you want to put a sublimation image on it and you want to bleach it it's not it's it it it may look good at first but when you wash it out with detergent and all that in the washing machine when you do that it's gonna wash out it's it's gonna it's gonna fade it's gonna fade yes it is i see you shaking your head back there you're saying uh oh ain't going good it's gonna work just fine no it's not gonna work just fine so you gotta get you let me ask you this question question why is everyone using shirts they're saying oh if you're going to do it you need to use a heather shirt have they told you why you have to use a heather shirt have they told you because if you'll look on the heather shirt the heather shirts are a 50 50 blend in other words it's 50 polyester and 50 50 cotton and if you've got 50 polyester in there you're going to be able to have an image that's going to be able to stick but it's going to fade it's not going to fade like it's 100 cotton it's only going to fade 50 percent [Music] i mean come on it's fifty percent pile in fifty percent cotton so whatever that ink is sticking to in that cotton is it's gonna fade it's not gonna be as bright but it's gonna be a good picture it's gonna be okay but are your customers gonna like it are your customers going to be satisfied with the first time that they wash that 50 50 blend that you didn't treat but you just sublimated to and and in a month from now after they've washed it three or four times is it still going to look as good as it did when you first made it all right you shouldn't have a whole lot of wear and tear on a shirt that's only been washed four or five times you shouldn't have that much fadeage shouldn't happen is that even a word faded you shouldn't have the fading is is bad so the best thing to do is if you're going to do a 50 50 blend on these heather shirts if you do that what i would do and i will show you not in this video in the next video i will load up with this video a second video this is part one of of your sublimation of your shirts with bleaching and i'm letting you know on the first part here on why if you are going to do it if you use heather church that they are a 50 50 blend at least the ones that i've seen they're 50 50 blend so you've got 50 polyester then the other 50 is cotton and the reason why is because the cotton in the polyester makes it feel good when you wear it it's it's it feels nice it's not clingy it's a it's a little clingy but not real clean this is 100 cotton so as you've got 100 cotton you can just wear it over everything and it'll just kind of you know it doesn't cling to everything it's not it's not straight it's just not it's not to me i feel that polyester is uncomfortable because i know it reveals every wrinkle you've got on your body every wrinkle you got and and so and look man i am not the six pack that i used to be when i was younger now i am a three liter and look as far as this as far as this is concerned i just ain't what i used to be and so to understand that that that that polyester and that cotton blend it makes it feel comfortable so it depends on how much polyester and how much cotton you like in your shirt me i'm satisfied with 100 cotton i don't have to have polyester in there but if you are in a business and you're trying to make your sublimation ink adhere to the shirt for your customers um then then more polyester works but if your customer doesn't like a lot of polyester and they're more into a more cotton blend and you have to get your sublimation ink to adhere to a cotton blend then you're gonna have to do a little more work it's one thing just to go ahead and print out the sublimation photo and heat press it onto the shirt and then once you got that done then you take it out there and you throw some bleach on it and you know you spray around there and bring out the the colors of the sublimation ink and i use all right now it's done all you gotta do is throw it in the water and and stop the fading process and you know from the bleach and all that blah blah blah blah blah blah and then you let it dry and you throw it in the dryer and you get everything nice and ready for the customer and and that's easy but if your customer wants a hundred percent cotton and likes that [Music] there can be a little more work but then you've got to still consider if you have a 50 50 blend 50 polyester 50 cotton do you want to treat that shirt and have it to where that sublimation ink will stay vibrant and looking good longer because you can go ahead and throw the sublimation picture on that 50 50 blend you can put that picture on there bleach it all that put it you can do all that but how long is the photo going to last is the picture going to stay vibrant for a long time after a few washes it's going to get dull so you have to figure out if you do a little extra work to make your work quality and last longer where you have repeat customers a lot of folks work for one customer but what about repeat customers once that customer gets it and after three or four washes it just dulls out they're gonna go i'm not buying from there no more because it just it's just dull it's just and after a few washes it's just and so they're gonna look for someone who has spent a little more time in quality and not quantity a lot of people are interested in quantity how much they can sell but it's a matter of not just how much you can sell it's a matter of when you sell it where you have repeat customers so understand your shirt understand your materials understand what you need to do to treat the shirt that when you do the work whether it be the sublimation with the bleaching and all because it's so popular why bring it up make sure that you've prepared your shirt so it will be ready for the sublimation and ready for the bleaching and then you know [Music] ready to get out there on the market so that's what you need to watch for i know some people will take and as they do their bleaching and everything they'll they'll spray their bleach down with hydrogen peroxide they say that is a neutralizer to stop no it's not oh i know boy i just made some people mad there that's a wives tale that's from what i have read on that um hydrogen peroxide is one of the ingredients in a in a in a neutralizer but it will not neutralize and stop the bleaching process on a bleaching shirt it takes a little bit more chemicals than that to do that but but the hydrogen peroxide is one of the chemicals in there but it has been known as a wise tale that it will either be um you use hydrogen peroxide or you use vinegar so look if you're using vinegar and hydrogen peroxide on it to try to get the the the the process of bleaching stopped it ain't working you're wasting your money best thing to do is if you're gonna do that i would take a five gallon bucket of plain water out there with me and on that five gallon bucket or or or a big old tub or something like that and once it's one it's once it's done bleaching once it's bleached its way toss it over there and that that that pure water in that bucket and go ahead and stop the bleaching process then put it in that fresh clean water stop that bleaching process um and everything and take it out and do the rest of the shirts the same way you say well that water thing's gonna have bleach in it it's gonna mess everything up well i i can't help that use a water hose once it's done and it's got there use your water hose and spray it down with a water hose you know once it's once it's done bleaching and all that stuff take it over there and get it in some water that's all i can tell you get in some water that's going to be the best neutralizer you can find it's water so um just sharing some tips with you i know if if you if you don't agree with what i said i'm sorry i uh i just i'm letting you know what i've been studying on as far as making sure that the information that goes out is correct and um and and as fact so because there's a lot of things we we tend to believe that we picked up as we went along when we heard from someone else but we really never really checked it out to see if it was true or not um sometimes we get so crazy thinking that ah i've got something nobody else has done i thought i'm saying that then you go out and say something that you know so anyways i may not be perfect and i may not always say the right thing but i'm going to try to bring you the truth so this is tom with the father's workshop screen printing and the next video will be part two we are going to try this and we're going to take a 100 cotton t-shirt not a 50 50 blend not a 50 poly and 50 cup 100 cotton and we are going to treat that cotton shirt just like we would by putting the sublimation on it we're going to do that we're going to treat it we're going to put the sublimation on it and then once the sublimation is put on it i'm going to take it and i will probably rinse it out and all and then put it in the dryer and let it dry once it's dried then we're going to take the shirt and we're going to bleach it now we're going to bleach it now we know that everything we've done is is right but i'm going to put it in water and wash it and then bring it out and do that to let you know that now we have washed it so if that um poly resin has washed out well then that picture is going to wash out too but we're going to do that and so when i put the bleach on it that picture should come out nice and vibrant nice and pretty of course then again i'm going to have to put it back in the water again to neutralize that bleach to keep it from bleaching more because we don't want to destroy the material give it to somebody we don't want them putting it on and all of a sudden it's like they had battery acid on the shirt before they got it and all of a sudden it just starts falling apart we want to make sure that when we get it it's a nice vibrant shirt so now they're going to wash it but you've already done it you've already pre-washed it and you know that it's holding the color so the next time they wash it it can hold the color and by doing that you know that by the way you treated it that you did your best so when your customer gets it or you give it away his birthday present or you have it for yourself you know that you gave your best on quality so when you put on your put it on your website or put it on etsy or ebay or anywhere else you can put made with care and quality so that's why i always do this i want you to know that i'm going to try to give you my best so this is time to follow this workshop screen printing this is part one stay tuned for part two lord bless bye [Music] you", "QIz2B4Jdkn0": "[Music] please like comment share and subscribe hey now it's your girl shanita nicole and welcome to do dream one if you're new and if you're already a dreamer welcome back welcome back welcome back so today we are going to be going over how to sublimate on white glitter vinyl so i'm really really excited today i have two projects i'm going to be doing i'm going to be printing this out on a square image and i'm going to be printing this image out on a circle so i'm going to show you two different ways to do it um the circle my best friend wants me to make this for her so i literally made this design myself for her and i'm using a circle template i'm going to use white vinyls white glitter vinyl and what i'm going to do is i'm going to print this out in silhouette because i'm in silhouette studio so i'm going to print this out in silhouette at 9.336 inches around and then i'm going to print the circle and glitter out a little bit above it now typically you put the image larger than the glitter but i'm going to do this one is going to be smaller because it doesn't really matter now i'ma show you how it matters when i do the other image i'm going to do so i printed this out in silhouette studio and then in cricut i'm going to show you how i printed this we are in cricut design space and i'm printing this circle at 9.5 and that's what it is all the way around now honestly it didn't matter because the background is white and the blue and the glitter is white so i could have made it the exact same size larger smaller etc but i i put it on top of each other i put the image here now you know you can't print out actual print and cut designs out larger in cricut so what i did was i put it inside of here so i could see how the image would be when i printed it out and i wanted it smaller versus larger with the circle because i'm gonna have to cut the circle around because i do have a cameo but i haven't set it up yet so i don't um know how to use it so i don't want to make it larger and then my outside circle is off i made it smaller so i'm going to hand cut around my circle and if it's off it's not going to matter because it's going to be inside of the glitter i hope that makes sense so that's why i made it different so this is going to be my first design i'm going to do when you do this you want to make sure that you heat your shirts up a little bit it gets any type of moisture out so i heat my shirt up as well as i use a lint brush so i want to make sure everything is going to be nice and smooth on there okay so that's what i do so i'm going to show you typically we use the lint roller to get any type of lint or dust or anything off of the shirt and then we typically you can use a teflon or butcher paper if you want but i know nothing's on my pad so i'm just heating up my shirt and what this does is it one gets the wrinkles out and then two it takes out any absorption any moisture anything like that some people do some people don't i typically do depending on the shirt how i want the images and things to stick so there's a good lint roller and then we have go ahead and get that out so that's how we do that once we do that i'm going to go ahead and um put the vine the glitter the white glitter vinyl on top of the shirts so i have two black shirts i'm going to be using i'm going to use white glitter vinyl on both one is going to be a circle one is going to be a square okay now for the second image i got this image off of google i'm not going to be selling this this is just for tutorial purposes but this is good old nipsy hustle if anyone knows me they know i love nipsey i'm so devastated about his passing i just continue to grieve which is so weird but i'm just like hurt anywho so this is um an artwork that is done outside of the marathon clothing nipsey hustle as you can see victory that it is so dope so i'm so excited to do this image now for this image this is how you typically do all of your cover up vinyl i'm sorry all of your layer glitter white vinyl with an image you want to make sure that the image is a little bit bigger than the vinyl and the reason you want to do that is because i'm using white vinyl this picture is not white like my other image so i wanted to cover up as much of the white vinyl as possible so it can look smooth and clear and crisp okay so for this image the um inches are 9.435 and height and 9.59 inches in width okay so that's what i'm doing for the image and i'm going to show you once again we're in silhouette studio because this is the only one that can print this large and then for um for the actual white glitter vinyl we can print out of cricut so i'm going to show you what that looks like okay so i'm inputting the image inside of cricket i'm saving it as a print and cut image and then i'm going to go ahead and upload the image and it's going to take a minute okay so i'm going to unlock the image when you unlock the image it lets you change it to the size that you want so if you remember in silhouette it is 9.435 in height or we can just type it at the top 9.435 and then with it is 9.594 so i'm going to press enter and then it's going to change the image so now we can actually put the image on top of each other to see exactly how much space is going to be so i technically could make my um image either a little bit bigger or i could make my vinyl a little bit smaller so you can do this so you can know for sure i'm not sorry i'm not showing you you can do this so you can know for sure so i think i'm going to make my glitter behind the image a little bit smaller because i want to make sure it covers it up a hundred percent completely okay so the picture can be a little bit larger we're gonna lock and load it and then that's we're gonna do so i'm gonna just cut a little bit of my vinyl off the glitter vinyl off so that it can be a little bit smaller than the actual photo okay so that's how you could always check it but as you know in cricut it will not print because it's too um because it's too large okay but we will print it out in silhouette alright so i'm gonna go ahead and start putting the glitter on the shirts and then i'm going to go ahead and then sublimate on top of the white glitter vinyl now i've used several different brands so it doesn't matter scissor is a great brand i always use that one a lot um i've tried other brands that i needed i tried cricut when i was like in a jam um i've tried other brands and they all seem to work for me but i believe scissor is the best brand um there is another brand i really like and i i have to find what the name of that is but yep so i'm going to go ahead press the glitter down and then i'm going to sublimate on top of that if you have any questions comments any easier tips anything please let me know okay so i have this it's like i create ruler by tam sweet life so if you wanted you could go to tamsuitelife.com um or follow her on ig by tam's sweet life that's i'll put it in the comments says b y t a m s s w e e t l i f e anywho so i use that to make sure it's perfect and because i'm a little bit ocd i also use this t ruler just to make sure that each side is exactly where it needs to be now each image will be a little bit different um and each size of the shirts may be a little bit different so this is a circle so it's a little bit different anywho i'm going to go ahead and press this on um yeah so i told you i have uh yet learned how to use my cameo so i'm literally oh the vinyls on the shirt it's nice and pretty so i'm learning how to um i haven't learned how to use my cameo so i'm going to just cut around the circle and that's why i gave it some wiggle room because i'm like i don't want to mess this up for my best friend but i don't know how to cut it out of pricking it so i'm just cutting it around and then i'm going to lay it on top and she's going to have her shirt that she wanted the other shirt is going to be a little bit different because it's square so squares i have a paper cutter that i could use to do that i mean or i could use it by hand as well but that's that thank you no i don't like it so i'm going to make it bigger so i'm printing out of my workforce epson workforce epson 72 i'm sorry printed out of my work for 7720 series popping colors cassette 2 that's my preset and i'm printing it out you should hear it in the background if you want to know what my presets are you can watch my how to sublime beginners video you can watch that again if you guys want me to i can make another one but i've already made it so it's kind of like i don't want to be redundant keep repeating myself so go ahead and watch that but i'm printing it out because i needed it to be a little bit larger so i printed it out this one is a little bit better but honestly i could have used more space i'm also noticing if you haven't noticed your um designs and cricut and this silhouette don't match up so my inches i've noticed they don't match up i know someone previously told me in my comments to make sure that um i think she said something like tapering off the image or something something like that but i have to look that up a little bit more to figure out what it is i have to do to make sure that the designs line up but this will work because it's literally just going to be glitter all around it so it's not going to matter but for my other image i'm going to have to make sure that it's perfect like i need it to be perfect like i needed to be but this one is perfectly fine for right now because it's just going to be white glitter around it and i already told her how the image would be and she agreed so that's not a problem at all so yeah so we're going to go ahead and take this down and i'm going to put it on 400 for 60 seconds that's what i'm going to sew now here i'm just measuring everything from the top making sure that everything is going to be the correct amount of inches from the top and the bottom that i want it to be so you could play around with it i'm like i said a perfectionist so when i do things i want to be as close as perfect as possible even though i am hand making it and human error you know but i try to make things okay so i use a sub paper as you can see and i use cosmos oh yeah okay so there we go i have it on 400 degrees for 60 seconds and this is the image that i created for my best friend well my boss friend that's what we call each other all right so that's how it looks now i'm going to do my second image on the square inch but it looks good i hope she like so i'm literally just cutting a little bit of it off so that i can have a little bit more of this overlapping the vinyl so i want to have the picture a little bit bigger than the vinyl so i'm taking just a little bit off so that it can overlap it a little bit so i'm taking it off on both sides the width and the height just a little bit okay so i've always been a person who i can eyeball things and look at things and know exactly how much to take off i don't know how i don't know if it's the photographer in me but i can look at things and see if they're like crooked or fix things just visually so i don't know how much i took off i just eyeballed it okay so now before i even put it on a shirt i see that it's a little bit overlapping and that's what i need because i don't want to see any of the white vinyl and excuse my niece in the background baby sitting in my knee so my daughter and is playing with my niece so that's what you hear in the background so anywho this is going to be perfect so now i'm going to press this on the shirt and then i'm going to press sub this one you see i got my ring light i got my ring light i have my [Music] tammysuitelife.com create ruler and i have my t ruler so i'm making sure that this is correctly in the middle so that it won't have any issues or problems and now i can go ahead press it and then i'll sub on top and yes i do use heat tape this tape is from amazon it came in a two pack um and this yellow is never transferred on anything of mine i've heard people say that it's transferred so until it does i'm gonna keep using it i may try a clear one they have blue ones they have all types but this is the one that i use and i've never had any issues from amazon so gonna go ahead and press it down now for real okay so here's something that i noticed depending on the brand of um white glitter that you'll be using it may have like this has little like lines in it it's not a bad thing it's not going to mess my images up but i did notice that so if you can see you see that it's like lines so that's going to come up in the image so that's okay so that's what i said you may want to play around this is not scissor brand i honestly have to look and see my friends tell me to try this brand out so i'm trying to get out my home girl hey girl tell me to try it out so i'm trying it out and um so it's not scissor i have to see what the name of it is but it has a little line so the image is gonna have those little lines but like i said that's perfectly okay i'm trying to think of other things i may have missed previously things i'm trying so if you can't see the entire image what i'm doing is i apologize but i'm just going the sides and making sure that it's overlapping on all four corners so that there won't be any white hopefully around the sides you don't want to see any of the white glitter because it's a color image so i'm just making sure that it's overlapping and the ink will get on the black but it's okay because it's blue and then hopefully it won't hopefully it may come out because that's not polyester so it shouldn't be an issue okay so i'm going to take this down sup i'm doing the glitt white glitter at the 3 30 for 15 seconds i'm on the heat press and then this i'm summing at 400 for 60 seconds okay so as i always say it's always more than one way to skin a cat this is how i tape it down i want to make sure all of my corners are taped down so that it can make sure that it absorbs and all of the white glitter i literally lifted each side up made sure that it was a little bit over the edge of each of the sides so i'm feeling really confident about it and i'm going to go ahead and sub it now like i said at 400 degrees for 60 seconds if you guys have any other tips or tricks please share thank y'all for sharing some of y'all are hitting me up on facebook instagram some of you guys are um commenting under my videos let me go check these babies out yeah so i got this nifty little thing from amazon it's by bryco goods and what this is is it holds my um butcher paper and then i can tear it off it would normally press this for 60 seconds at 400. right i have to loosen the tape up a little bit it's hot but i cannot wait to see this finished product i loosened up some of this tape and i'm gonna look and see oh yeah it's literally perfect and i don't say things that perfect [Music] i did so good guys i'm so happy because i'm like i'm doing the tutorial and i hope it'll come out right [Music] and then oh you got all that ink off here baby yes it's acer paper 125 grams cosmo ink on top of white glitter vinyl so yeah so here's the finished product i told you i used asa paper cosmo ink white glitter vinyl i hope you guys enjoyed it i hope it made sense if you guys have any questions comments concerns please go ahead and let me know if you want me to go over anything else let me know that as well but um if you know any other tips or tricks please share for everybody in the comments as well as for myself i love hearing all the things you guys have been sharing with me thank you so much bye thank you for your time please like share and subscribe bye", "2AOnHPxoLDs": "[Music] setting everybody boy big brando and today let's talk about a standard street wear t-shirt now as most of you guys know if you've been watching my videos or you've seen a bunch of my videos where i talk about blank t-shirts i always say it's a personal preference when i say personal preference i mean people have different ideas of what quality is how shirts supposed to fit what they want to offer their customers what they like in a t-shirt what they don't like all of that stuff plays a big role in ordering blank t-shirts but on this channel i always talk about running a brand from home i don't know much about running like a fitness brand or running different brands like with unisex t-shirts and stuff like that i don't offer any female t-shirts one of the big reasons why i don't offer women's t-shirts is because there's way too many options and you got to remember every woman is shaped differently and at the same exact time women respond better when they can try something on because sometimes they might wear medium but then sometimes in certain shirts they might wear a large or might be opposite maybe they wear a medium in certain shirts and then a small insert shirt so that range is very hard to gauge i personally don't offer exchanges and returns on my online stores so it's hard for me to send a shirt to a female that has to try it on before she buys it or if i'm vending it's hard for a female to pick up a shirt and be like yeah this is gonna fit me because sometimes their chest size might be a lot bigger or a lot smaller but their body size might be the same as somebody else so it's gonna make wearing the shirt a lot different also there's tank tops racerbacks halter tops crop tops unix v-necks crewnecks slouch necks there's so many different options when it comes to female shirts that it is very overwhelming so for myself i stay away from women's t-shirt and that's why i stay away from them because there's way too many options and it's hard to get the sizing right for females on top of that printing on t-shirts for women very hard also you gotta remember i use a standard rule of putting four fingers down laying the design down on a women's shirt a lot different if they're using a v-neck you can't do that five-finger down thing because then the design is going to land over their chest and then it might stretch it out depending on the size of their chest also if you put a design on there sometimes the chest might be a little bigger where the design wraps under and it's not really being showcased sometimes it's stretched out sometimes it doesn't land in the correct spot to be legible you know what i mean so for those reasons i stay away from women's shirts so let's get back and talk about a standard streetwear t-shirt a lot of people say hey i want to start the streetwear brand what's the best blank to you you got to remember there's a ton of different ideas of what street wear is you got that high fashion street wear stuff that's like fear of god and off-white and all those other brands and they might have some sort of like premium feel and then you have street wear that's kind of like the old like hundreds and diamond kind of skate street wear sneakerhead streetwear type of stuff so for myself i like to take the middle road of streetwear the streetwear companies that did like graphic tees like the hundreds and diamond and crooks and castles and a lot of these other brands undefeated all of those brands have really really cool standard street wear feeling t-shirts right not really like the high fashion stuff but it's also um like an everyday wear t-shirt for me that's what i like to compare when it comes to street wear that's what i'm thinking about so if you were trying to create a brand like that or you wanted a t-shirt similar to that i would suggest the all style 1301 this t-shirt right here let me see if i can focus in all style classic all style 1301 same exact thing very standard cut very standard fit very generic t-shirt so for myself if i was doing a street wear brand or i needed just a generic style t-shirt that's true to size it's not form fitting it's not really super baggy it's not heavy weight but it's not lightweight it's kind of in between it'll be considered a heavyweight t-shirt but compared to like real heavyweight t-shirt like pro club this shirt is not as heavy as that feels good on body straight generic fit a lot of your favorite brands use this same blank a lot of your favorite brands based their blanks around this t-shirt like if you ever took this t-shirt blank to the mall and you compared it to like the hundreds logo t-shirts or if you compared it to diamond or whoever else you're into or any of those skate street wear type brands chances are it's going to look and feel similar to this 1301 and i'm not saying i know exactly what blank every company uses there's always people that hit me up and they're like hey man you know what blank does off-white use what blank does supreme use i have no idea i just go based off of feel and fit right so if you wear a lot of supreme stuff obviously you know the fit and feel of a supreme t-shirt so buying a blank you would compare it to that right i personally don't wear supreme t-shirts so i don't know what it feels like i don't know what it fits like i don't know who they use but i have bought stew c t-shirts before i've bought the hundreds t-shirts before undefeated crooks and castles a lot of these other brands i've bought their t-shirts i've seen what they feel like i've wore them like a lot of brands in hawaii defend hawaii hawaii's finest a lot of these t-shirt companies use the same exact t-shirt these all-style t-shirts man so i know the fit i feel i i understand it i know my size in it if i was doing like street wear type of brand this is the t-shirt that i would use and this is the t-shirt i recommend a lot of people when they say they want to start a streetwear brand and they're looking for a good blank this is a perfect example of a t-shirt to use now there's a lot of people that are gonna be like well all right what's the best workout t-shirt or what's the best tri-blend t-shirt or moisture wicking t-shirt i have no idea i use 100 cotton t-shirts for all my brands i like to buy the t-shirts that my customers like to wear none of my customers wear tri blends or dry blends or moisture wicking shirts so i have no idea the best advice i could give if you wanted to do that or if you wanted a form-fitting t-shirt or if you're looking for a more lightweight ring spun cotton t-shirt is to order samples you could go to companies like alpha broder and tsc mission imprintables sanmar all of these third-party suppliers carry a bunch of different brands under one roof if i were you i'd create accounts with them and then i'd buy one t-shirt that is you know bella canvas and one that's next level one gilding and one all style in my size and the color i wanna offer and then i'd wear it press on it test it out so that way you have an understanding on what t-shirt you want to offer and what you're looking for out of these t-shirts asking some idiot on youtube like myself what i prefer and i tell you all style 1301 you go and you buy a shitload of these and you're trying to do like some fitness brand or something like that geared towards people that work out and you're like man this t-shirt's heavy it's thick it's stiff i don't like this shirt you asked me what t-shirt i recommend and i'm giving you a t-shirt that i recommend but you have a different idea of what you want so you have to just do your own research when it comes to these blank t-shirts this video is for the guys that are talking about street wear style t-shirts i'm not talking high fashion street wear i'm not talking i'm talking just that regular ash street wear regular generic fitting t-shirt you can't go wrong with this all style 1301 the classic all-style t-shirt you can also find these at your local swap meet a lot of times they go by aaa because the name is all style apparel and activewear triple a aaa their old logo used to be like a big a and then there's like three little a's in there that used to be their logo so the t-shirt was called aaa if you want to swap me t-shirt warehouse stuff like that they'll have them that's usually the generic you know three for 10 t-shirt that you could buy or whatever it is so once again basic street wear generic fitting t-shirt all style 1301 is a good t-shirt i know there's going to be a bunch of people what do you think about the gildan 9301 or whatever t-shirt that could be comparable i have no idea right i have no idea about any other t-shirt all style is the what this video is about that's what i'm talking about all style right now i don't get paid by all style this is just because i always get comments asking about i want to start a streetwear brand what t-shirt do you recommend it's easier for me to just make this video and be like check it out man if i was starting streetwear brand tomorrow i'd be using all style 1301. reason being is just because it's true to size people that wear extra large will fit extra large people that wear double x will fit the double leg they understand this fit and feel because chances are they already have this t-shirt in their closet from some other brand this is a very generic t-shirt a lot of people use it same goes for like gilding a lot of people use gildan i hate the sleeves on gilding i hate the way that it's cut i hate that boxy feel of a gilding t-shirt this one fits me a little bit better that's why i use them all right hopefully this helps somebody out out there because there's a lot of people that hit me up if you ever cruise the comments of any of my videos chances are there's some guy that wants to start a streetwear company and he's looking for this blank and that's why i made this video was for those guys that are in my comments asking about streetwear t-shirts now if you're asking about what blanks all these companies use i have no idea i have a system on how i figure out how certain companies use their blanks it won't work for everybody but if i ever needed that information there's ways that you can look on youtube and find that information you got to do a lot of digging and searching but sometimes it's out there you know what i mean and the way i do it is whenever any of these companies have uh warehouse sales or whatever it is i look for videos of people going to their warehouse sales or sample sales or whatever it is and then they have the [ __ ] boxes stacked up in there if they're using all style t-shirts all the all style shirts are bagged up put in these all-style boxes they cut a hole in them so you can grab the shirts you're seeing what blanks they're using you know what i mean it'll be a shitload of gildan boxes or next level or or bella canvas or whatever company they use that's how i figure out what brands use certain blanks is just by searching their warehouse sales or end of the year sale or sample cell when they show their warehouse you're seeing the inner workings of what they're doing that's how i find out what certain brands are using what blanks because all the boxes are there right there's just like a shitload of all style boxes in their warehouse chances are they're using all style you can see the logo on the side of the box but there's also a lot of these companies that use their own cut and so program they have their own custom cut t-shirts and they're not using a generic blank or a already made blink so what you have to do is you have to try to compare certain blanks to what they're using to get something similar but it won't be exactly the same it's like trying to compare hats to new era hats you're not buying a blank new era hat what you're doing is you're buying a blank hat and trying to compare it to a new era hat trying to figure out how it fits and feels how the how the bill looks how high is the crown all of that stuff so same goes for somebody that's using you know their own cut and so program their own custom t-shirt program you're gonna have to get blanks and then match it up to that if you own that brand's t-shirts like i said if you own supreme and supreme uses their own custom t-shirt program you would have to buy some blanks and then match it up to your supreme t-shirt to see if you could kind of match up the fit and feel and get something close to it but you're not going to get something exactly like it if they're using their own program so hopefully this helps somebody out out there

Caesar North America and today we're going to talk about one of the most popular forms of printing sublimation and did you know that you can now sublimate on our Caesar glitter stick around and I'll show you how all right now we're on the application portion you'll have your sublimated prints ready to go cut down we're gonna have our cuttable glitter cut down weeded ready to go we're gonna have our heat press set to 180 degrees Celsius or 365 degrees Fahrenheit you're going to be at a medium medium to firm pressure now the big perk about sublimating on to glitter is you are not only restricted to polyester you can also print on cotton and dark garments so now we're gonna get these ready to go for upcoming trade shows so we're gonna start by preheating our cotton t-shirt we're gonna do a front and back can use our heap heat transfer pillow in case you have any kind of obstruction in the way so we can get even pressure which is very important in this process now we're going to preheat for two to three seconds okay now the first step is taking your glitter finding your spot where you want to place it now normally you'll be at 320 degrees if you were just working with glitter but since we're doing sublimation we're gonna keep it at 365 Fahrenheit we're only gonna tack this for 2 to 3 seconds hot peel okay now we're going to be going on to the sublimation portion so we're going to grab our sublimated transfers line them up over our glitter pieces now if you think it's going to shift out at registration you have your heat tape that you're able to apply directly on to your sublimated transfer and what this will do is keep this in place when your Heat pressing and avoid shifting so you don't get ghosting or anything like that just apply two small pieces in each corner now we're going to go back and hit this for a full 60 seconds alright just peel a cup pieces off now we're gonna go back and do the front and now since there's buttons on this shirt we're gonna make sure they're off the press because with the amount of temperature and time these will potentially melt so make sure you have the opposite side with the buttons hanging off your press we're going to take our heat transfer pillow preheat it for 2-3 seconds grab our glitter cut piece we're going to hate it for two to three seconds take our sublimated cut piece find a registration and to keep it in place we are going to add some heat transfer tape now we're going to go back and hit it for the full 60 seconds we're gonna peel that hot that's a pretty awesome process isn't it you can do the exact same thing today now Caesar doesn't manufacture the printers the Pink's or the paper but if you want to find out more about the cuttable heat transfer vinyl glitter please contact us at cesar na komm or visit your nearest authorized caesar distributor for more information about it also if you like what you saw please subscribe to our youtube channel here and please visit us at some of our

the description below thank you for sticking around", "HYi2Hwn3avc": "[Music] setting everybody boy big brando and today let's talk about blank t-shirts now one of the top five questions i always get is what is the best blank t-shirt to use or what's better this blank t-shirt or this blank t-shirt or where can i buy quality blank t-shirts for cheap prices now you might be new to my channel and i always say when it comes to quality and the best it's all personal preference what you think is high quality or what you think is the best is gonna be different from the next person's best quality best t-shirt and for myself when i buy blank t-shirts i buy based on the customer i buy what the customer wears now with that being said i also buy blank t-shirts based on convenience why do i do that so for myself and my personal brands and my personal operation i use pro club and all style why do i use these two companies because my customer base is used to wearing pro club t-shirts my other customer base for some of my other brands are used to wearing all style t-shirts so i buy based on what they wear now when i'm printing for somebody what i stock in-house i always stock these two brands let's just say i'm doing 120 t-shirts it's friday night i'm pressing up some t-shirts the order has to be delivered on sunday morning so friday i'm pressing up some shirts i'm in the zone i'm getting them done and then i mess up on two now let's just say two that i mess up on is a black extra large and a black large all style 1301 let's just say so we have a large and an extra large black 1301 that i mess up on if i was using bella canvas next level optima some of these other brands that i can't get my hands on directly i would have to order online but like i said it's friday night i'm pressing i need to get this job delivered on sunday so i use pro club and all style because i could go to my local t-shirt warehouse saturday morning and pick up a large extra large 1301 all-style t-shirt and just pay retail that way i could fulfill the order get it out to the customer but if i was using something like next level or bella canvas or one of these other brands i would have to order it and it's not coming the next day on saturday it'd probably come on that following monday or tuesday so on sunday i would have to tell the customer hey you know what you're gonna have to wait a few days to get your order so now i'm pushing the deadline back because i screwed up on something so for me buying based off of convenience makes it a lot more easier for me to operate so that way if i am doing these rush jobs where i'm pressing on a friday delivering on a sunday if i mess up or let's say the customer calls me last minute and says hey i want to add 13 more t-shirts to that order easy call i could just go down to the t-shirt warehouse or to my swap meet or i could even go down to the liquor store pick up some pro clubs or all style t-shirts and then get that order fulfilled so does that make that t-shirt the best  yeah it does in my case it's the best for me because it's based off of convenience based off of what my clientele is used to wearing now for you if you're starting your brand and you're like i need to get the best t-shirt out there i highly recommend going based on what your customer already wears now you're like man how do i know what my customer wears because my customer's a stranger i don't know nothing about them well use social media instagram facebook your customers post pictures of themselves wearing t-shirts you look at that picture how's that customer wearing their t-shirt now is that customer wearing a fitted t-shirt or is it a loose baggy t-shirt if it's a fitted t-shirt chances are it's ring-spun cotton maybe a 50-50 cotton poly blend but you know it's fitted you know it's a trendier cut so that way you could go with bella canvas next level optima and those types of options now if they're wearing a looser fitting t-shirt maybe it's 100 cotton jersey cotton you could go with gildan all style hanes anvil that's how you're gonna figure out what you should offer your customers now for example if you looked at my personal instagram you'd see me wearing a shitload of pendleton's maybe some jerseys but if you see me wearing t-shirts you're gonna be like all right this guy doesn't wear fitted t-shirts he wears regular cotton t-shirts so you'd be safe using a gildan or all style something like that but if you went to some dude that works out and maybe he's showing himself in the gym and some of his t-shirts are fitted hugging the sleeves to show off all that progress he's making in the gym he's not gonna be wearing the loose fitting cotton t-shirts he's gonna want that ring spun the thinner feel the tighter feel to show off the guns you know what i'm saying but if you tried to offer me that thinner ring spun cotton t-shirt i probably wouldn't wear it because i don't want my nipples showing through my t-shirt so i wear the looser jersey cotton shirt that's just how you could see what your customers wear now that's you doing your research as a brand owner on what your customers are into all of this helps because now you're making the sale that much easier so there's no guesswork when a customer wants to shop with you the models that you have or the t-shirts you're showing that you're going to be using they can see what it looks like because you did the research and looked at their instagram and found out what they like to wear so hopefully this helps you out i know there's a lot of you out there that are going to be mad at this video because you just want to know what t-shirt should i use that's always a question but if i just told you all right use pro club and then you buy six seven dozen pro club t-shirts you press on them you offer to your customers your customers come back and say why the is this t-shirt so heavy why is the collar so tight why is it so baggy why is the sleeve so long i'm just gonna say hey you asked me what t-shirt and i'm giving you the answer whose fault is it mine or yours you wasted all the money i'm trying to help you not waste any money by just throwing some random brand name at you and you going out to buy it because i'm gonna get some affiliate money off of it that i'd rather you save the money and do the research so that way you make better decisions for your business i'm not here just to sell you on some i'm here to help you make a better decision for your business so that way you make money and not waste money does that make sense to you hopefully that does because for myself every time somebody asks this question and i tell them hey it's based on personal preference what do you like out of a t-shirt what do you want to offer they get all mad like just give me the brand name and then if i tell them all right go with all style then they get the all-style t-shirt they're like i hate the cut of this well you ask me what i use and that's what i use don't be mad because you didn't tell me you wanted a ring-spun cotton t-shirt or fitted shirt or you wanted something trendy with like those weird scoop tails or the scallops cut in them and all that other crazy nah i'm just using basic t-shirts if you want to know what brands i use pro club all style basically it i gave you the reasons why i use them there's that or if you wanted to just order a bunch of different blank t-shirts open up accounts with people like um mission and printables tsc alpha broder um i got a link for one of them in the description box these are third-party suppliers that offer a bunch of different brands like bella canvas next level anvil gildan all style uh champion haynes all that stuff they're all under one roof you order one of each in different cuts your size wear them see what you like about them wash them press on them that way you have a better idea on testing out before you offer it you know what i mean hopefully this helps you guys out if you guys have any questions or complaints leave it in the comments or if you just wanted to keep the conversation rolling leave it in the comments or hit me on instagram big brando tv it is always better for you to leave a comment instead of dming me i do not get i have 190 something dm's i think right now there's no way i'm getting through all of those leave it in the

[Music] um [Music] oh you", "JGf2kB3tY-s": "[Music] cheri Bixler and i have a pattern sample production and consulting company i cater to people who want to start their own fashion company today i've been asked the question what type of fabric is cotton Jersey well Jersey is a fabric that stretches and cotton is a natural fabric so you have a fabric that's all natural and it stretches to some degree it doesn't stretch a lot but it stretches a little bit now usually to find out if a fabric is Jersey and all of these fabrics here are Jersey you can do a roll test ro ll test and simply cut the fabric across and once you cut it across it should start to kind of roll a little bit on its own but if you pull it it completely rolls up and if you try to roll it back down it rolls back up now if you do this on a fabric that is not Jersey and you you cut across here if it rolls up slightly and then you try to pull it down it's going to stay like that it's not gonna roll back up again which is the tendency the quality of a jersey fabric and this can be a very desirable finish and t-shirts because sometimes you'll see t-shirts and they have the sleeves or they have the hems and it rolls completely up like this and it looks great and they just leave it raw in some cases they can even use a machine it's called the Mero machine finish this stitch so it's a little more finished and then it'll just roll up again but it doesn't Ravel so I think that basically concludes what Jersey is I want to thank you for joining me today my name is sherry Bixler I'm the author of how to start a fashion company find out more about me at my site sherry Bixler thank you you [Music]", "XYmRMY5z2Kw": "if you truly want to change the world you have to speak a language that everybody understands everybody understands the manufacturing process for a parallel generates a tremendous amount of waste you just have a lot of unused pieces of fabric and many times that's just thrown away I mean it's perfectly good continents as good as the same fabric that is used in the t-shirt you know we're thinking about it all wrong we can change the way that we think about an industry we can change the way that we approach our waste streams we can change the way that we approach our raw material inputs and we've operated under a set of assumptions for a really long time and now is the time that we can challenge those assumptions in a real tangible way so on the responsibilities we're actually gathering those up sorting them by color using a process that tears them down and reforms them back into a fiber knit into a fabric and then CERN and so because you don't have to grow a crop you don't have to use any of the water that's associated with that additionally we have the ability or go the dyeing process using a process that's blending scraps and it's blending different colors and then when you add all those up in the combination of the recycle cotton and their cycle polyester reduces the water impact by 96% and the fact that recycled cotton doesn't require growth land-use synthetic fertilizers which reduces the carbon impact of that shirt by 45% just super rad every responsibility that we make is cuts owned and rented a factory that's Fairtrade certified [Music] this premium you have at the scale that we're doing production with them has a dramatic impact on every single employee that I think that was the most compelling realization I had when getting into this project is that the t-shirts are saving 63 gallons of water peace when you look at the volume do we're getting into the millions of gallons that's where you really start to see the overall happen and how meaningful this small decision to change the impasse or a t-shirt and have on the global footprint that we have as a brand and a product [Music]", "iw7-opm0Z3U": "hey what's up guys artist dirty Donnie gillies here I have figured out how to fade a t-shirt we're going to a step-by-step and I'm going to show you how to film I have a few shirts here in the meantime please like and subscribe hit the belt you want to be notified when my shows come up Donnie TV [Music] in episode 44 of Donnie TV how to make your shirts avenge a lot of you asked how can I fade my shirt well I figured it out check it out there's also a link below to episode 44 if you want to make your shirts vintage so now you can fade them and make them vintage on Donnie TV so this is a shirt that I did this is one of many shirts I've done for the band Metallica I've done a lot of art for them I know that you can see it on my website through DICOM we're gonna fade this shirt I've already done this once and I faded a black shirt I'm gonna show you if you do it too much it's just gonna turn Brown figure out how to fade a shirt now I'm gonna try a quarter of a quarter of a cup okay so I've got 1/2 of 1/4 a cup of bleach I've got a half a bucket of warm water hot water I'm gonna mix it up really well fill the washing machine up with this solution then when the washing machine is ready to go I'm that's what I'm gonna dump my shirt in because I don't want it to get all splotchy I want it to be evenly dispersed we don't want that shirt to bunch up and get a white spot in it okay [Music] and now pouring in the bucket of water with the solution [Music] okay so this one came out amazing we're totally happy with this one we ran this through the system four times that's with 1/8 a cup of bleach each time this one came out amazing this is the old navy shirt same thing this came out great so the big fail on this was the Metallica shirt I call this a fail I blew it out this is a Hanes shirt now I used too much bleach on this I used a quarter a cup of bleach and I did it twice for some reason they went totally Brown it's I think it might be Haynes the brand's so when you do this I want you to be really careful and don't use your favorite shirts I would test it out on some maybe I mean Old Navy shirts work great this we don't know what brand this is but it's not Old Navy so it worked great on these - just be careful because if you put a really good shirt like this and you blow it out I can't help you there but don't use too much bleach the key is 1/8 the cup of bleach with 2.5 gallons of water and then you want to put that in with the hot water that's already inside of the washing machine [Music] we're gonna sing it relax we got the poster shop we got the t-shirt shop t-shirts posters we got stickers sticker packs all kinds of stuff [Music] you", "5by5-cEgiFE": "[Music] hey guys so I wanted to talk a little bit more about sublimation today's July 3rd and I wanted to do something patriotic now I found this design of the Eagles and I printed it up on my paper here it is showing the bar tabs that I'm gonna use and here's a blank one that I'm fixing to use today now I got these sent for by JDS so if you have a reseller permit you can make an account with JDS and order everything from them now as you can see here I've already sublimated on one side of this bottle opener I really love it but remember anything that is white it's just gonna come out like steel because the inks don't print the white on it so but I loved how it came out I loved how it turned out it looks really cool like I said I only printed one side of it but you see this little scratch right there it came like that from the factory and I think that whenever you sublimate on it it won't that scratch will come through because I noticed on one of the impossible cones that I was gonna give away now who knows I may give this one away too I don't know I kind of like it for myself but we shall see if you like it and you want it or anything and you want me to do it as a giveaway just say something in the comments below and I might throw it in there in the away that's coming up pretty soon so I wanted to follow I wanted to try something on a t-shirt now this is a 50/50 cotton polyblend now I know they say that when you sublimate on this type of shirt that they ain't doesn't come out very good so what I did is I'm gonna go ahead and try it and see and I did the same design that I put on the bottle opener so here I am pressing it at 400 and 400 degrees but it says 403 on there for 40 seconds now it's gonna take a little bit of time I'm just anxious to see what its gonna look like guys but remember they say that 100% polyester you get a better pop on the colors but I'm just so anxious to try it I had a 50/50 shirt and I wanted to see what it would look like and I ended up blowing up the design that I put on that bottle opener on there so we'll see what it looks like now bear with me because here I am fixing sticking my hand on and I just remembered it's at 400 degrees but here it is guys what do y'all think so far I mean I just blew up that picture now this is eight-and-a-half by eleven and I mirrored the image on it that way I could print it up and now remember I stuck a piece of that butcher paper in between just in case the ink didn't bleed all the way through to the other side so but it looks good and I mean the feel of it it you can't really feel it because it feels like the shirt like I said it it becomes part of the shirt but maybe a little bit more pressure because it looks like some of the color didn't quite come off but I mean it it has that vintage faded look on it almost but I mean they possibility with your Sawgrass machine are endless and I'm just barely at the tip of the edge figuring out you know what you can do and can't do with it so like I said I'm really liking the way it looks here it is and I'm put it on the hanger so y'all guys can see it better but there it is eight-and-a-half by eleven blown up looks good to me I like it like I said this is a fifty fifty poly cotton blend on the Gildan 8000 so I mean the whole reason to meet getting the sublimation printer is because I wanted to expand my business to other things so guys don't hesitate to get your sawgrass printer or your sublimation printers because the possibilities are endless remember guys there is a giveaway coming soon stay tuned for that don't forget to hit like

you so much for joining me once again if it's your first time here don't forget to subscribe to the channel and give this video a thumbs up so you guys asked for a video how to directly and broader to a t-shirt or garment whatever you want to know so this is gonna vary depending on the material this is not like a universal thing so I advise you guys to get old shirt or old pants or old sweatshirt and experiment a little bit because the same tension and things like that don't apply to every single garment you don't make the same you don't use the same settings for every garment because different fabrics have different thicknesses so it's gonna it's gonna vary it's gonna be trial and error you're gonna have to play around with it but I'm going to show you how I embroider directly to garments and the things that you're going to need and some tricks some tension tricks in your machine that you might want to look out for but mainly I want you guys to pay attention to how I move my fabric to the preparation before I hope it all right because that's going to be key that's gonna be key that along with attention is gonna be key alright so you're gonna have to play along with play around with those few things so let's jump into it without further ado let me show you what you're gonna need alright guys so the main thing I want you guys to get is some spray on adhesive I have right here fast tech 384 I've checked in the Amazon store and I can't seem to find it but there's many different versions of it but you want it what you want to do is you want to make sure that you check and make sure you can use it for own fabrics okay so mine right here it says ideal for flash curing screen printing and plastisol inks so I got this for my screen printing I was going to start screen printing but I never started screen printing so this is the stuff that you're gonna need you don't just hoop up your fabric your stabilizer underneath your fabric just like you do when you're making a patch you want it use some fast tech because I'm telling you you got to make your fabric a little bit like a little bit more solid and a little bit more stable it needs some aid because you're the way the t-shirts are made they're made very thin they're made very thin so that it be comfortable when somebody's wearing it so you want to make it a little bit thicker so you need this spray on adhesive I cannot stress this enough you need to get the spray on adhesive product links to some adhesive that I recommend will be down below okay so the second thing you're gonna need is some fabric all right you're gonna need some fabric you're not gonna use your tearaway stabilizer you're stitching this onto a shirt all right you don't want to use tearaway stabilizer you want to use actual material and you want to cut out the excess around the around the must got got a sale on a website you want to UM cut out the excess of after you're done stitching it out you want to physically cut it out use your free check on there if you want to but you the main thing you're gonna want to use material and not tearaway stabilizer okay I'm gonna say if your stitching out a four by four you're gonna you're gonna cut out ten by ten all right you're gonna cut out ten by ten all right so cut out a ten by ten if you're using four by four hoop cut out a ten by ten piece of fabric all right even though your design is gonna be like this small because you want it to hoop properly all right so just listen what I'm saying dude I'm telling you to do okay all right that's the second step step number two okay those are two things that you're gonna need you have everything else actually so those are two things you're gonna need spray on adhesive and some fabric all right everybody once you have you are ten by ten a square piece of cloth I cut this out to 11 by 11 inches all right once you got that you get your t-shirt I got a small t-shirt here and what up this is what I'm gonna do this is what I advise you to do okay you look at your t-shirt you decide where you want your design to go and you kind of line this up like this and what I'm doing is I'm kind of like measuring out I'm gonna place my hoop so I grab my hoop and I say I'm gonna place it like this or like this you just figure out where you gonna place your hoop and most likely you're gonna place your loop like this but you want to keep track of where this is right here all right this is the part that's hooking up to the Machine and I'll show you why later so you know you want your want your cloth to lay around this part because this is gonna be your backing so what I'm gonna do is what I do on this side all right so I'll turn my shirt inside out turn my shirt inside out lay it down flat all right all right turn it down and setup lay it down flat now because I turned it up inside out it's not on this side it's on this side all right so I'm gonna lay my backing down so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna spray this I'm gonna spray this material right here and I'm gonna place to place it down on there all right so let me show you what I'm doing all right I got my I got my fast tack right spray on adhesive so I'm gonna spray spray it on there this stuff is very very sticky bring it on there and now I'm just going to lay it down make sure this is flat make sure this is nice and flat I'm gonna lay it down on there cuz it's gonna stick this stuff is good just lay it down on there like so just like that all right so I got my fast tack on it's stuck to there all right stuck on this shirt so now this is my stabilizer all right and when you peel it off it comes right off but this is what we're using a stabilizer shirt and I would turn it back right side in all right turn it back around right side in now you can kind of see how it's making the shirt that is kind of soft it's making it have less gif because it's it's like it's like a layer of protection all right so this is where it gets critical so this is what I do I take the bottom part of my shirt and I just start rolling it up like this you see what I'm doing rolling it up rolling it up all right now everybody's going to do this part right here different some people use like templates I eyeball it and I take and I put this under here and I kind of like line it up to the point where it looks pretty pretty in the center not not in the center but like where I want my design to be so you know your design is going to be in the center of this hoop so if you want it to be on a pocket so this right here in this case is going to be on a left breast all right and normally you put stuff right here on the right breast but this one was gonna be on the left breast gonna be a little different is it all right you typically want to put stuff over here but you know I'm just making this video just for demonstration purposes all right so let me line this up so the design is going to start stitching out I'm gonna put move it up just a little bit and typically you want your design to start like you want you to design to be like right here so it's gonna starve out yeah all right I move it up just a little bit all right so that's about where I want it to be so now I'm gonna hoop it all right loop that just like that nice and flat all right get a slack out see how it's nice and perfectly flat and you reach under there and you go ahead and screw that in screw that in and make that nice and tight screwing it in alright alright so now we got that screwed in we can go ahead and put in a machine alright so come over to our machine one thing we're gonna do is make sure we got enough bobbin thread in to our to do our design and I don't think we do so I'm gonna put a new bobbin in well this bobbin has a lot on it I just switched I had another white bobbin sitting on a saw so I'm just going to use this and I'm going to turn the bobbin in right here alright it's actually one multi-part video I should did this off-camera but it's okay alright so now we got our shirt we are going to pass our access material underneath the needle open it up from the bottom open it up hold it bring it slide it underneath make it flat and slide it underneath there just like you're doing position it and grab this part right here and attach it and then lay it out and check to make sure no shirt is underneath here alright so all the access is just right there now this is the part where you want to pay attention guys pay attention because this is where you can mess up your design because typically you would stitch it out and it was stitch out this way well guess what your designs gonna be sideways your neckline is over here alright your neckline is over here so you have to turn your design in the application all right so let's navigate to our design alright we're gonna go over here focus the camera a little bit and we're going to navigate to our USB Drive and pick out a file that we're gonna embroider alright you guys see I have a lot of files on here so it's gonna take a little while and I'm going to do a double alright so I just changed up the definition file and I did the double stitch thing so this right here guys is trial and error this is what you're gonna be doing trial and error stuff okay now wait 19 where's my dubnation where's my dubnation patch all these files are available on a Wacom there it is right there dub nation all right so that's the file alright so as it lies right here it's gonna stitch out as it lies right here it's gonna stitch out this way you have to rotate it rotate 90 degrees now it's sideways now it's going to stitch out this way because this is where our neckline is you got to pay attention to that alright so my design is now sideways and the machine is gonna stitch it out this way alright because I just turned it press ok to confirm and edit embroider so it's gonna take 27 minutes we're going to load up our first thread it's gonna be the blue all right and we got a white shirt so we can see and track along with the progress let's load up our white thread I said white thread did not you guys do it on that blue thread so you guys over top you this time I load it on up I load it on up and we're gonna start with the stitch out alright let's go actually guys before we start with the stitch out I want to show you guys something really critical to stitching out garments stitching out embroidery designs onto garments ok and it's going to be the tension wheel this is your tension wheel right and a lot of people don't know how to use this thing don't know what it does or maybe they're just not you know for me with their you know operations so I'm gonna show you this is what I have it on normally when stitching out patches but okay so just look at it like this the lower the number the less tension the higher the number the more tension the tighter the tighter it is the lower the number the less tension once again the higher the number the okay and the higher the number the more tension alright so low numbers equals a loose stitch right high numbers equals a tight stitch the tighter the stitch the more pull the more it's going to pull on the fabric and the more it's going to give you that effect of the fabric pulling that you don't want that you don't want okay so let's think about it like this you got the t-shirt right here right got your t-shirt right here okay so when you're looking when you're trying to adjust for attention right and you're doing your tests and stuff like that you want to look at it like this the bobbin thread and the spool thread are supposed to meet in the middle all right if you have too much tension the bobbin thread at the top is going to pull the spool thread to the top and you're going to see some of the schools pull spool threads start to peak through all right and in turn if this if the tension is is too is too loose right now if you have too much if you I'm sorry I'm saying that wrong if you if the tension is too loose yeah if the tension is too loose then the spool thread is going to pull the bobbin thread through and you're gonna see the bottom turn at the bottom so you need it to be even you need a good tension so that both of the bobbin thread and the spool thread meet in between if that makes any sense to you all right so once again too much tension the bobbin thread will pull the spool thread through to a little tension and the spool thread will pull the bobbin thread all the way through you got to have just the right amount so that your design stitches out as intended alright so now that all that is taken care of we got our attention right once again right we have our design turned the correct direction so that stitches corresponding to the neckline right there now we can go ahead and start stitching out lower the foot okay and at it sorry there we go little foot design changes because it and edit and then we can press the button and let the design start to stitch out and see how this comes out guys alright making sure we have nothing underneath there and just watch it stitch out once again guys if you haven't purchased your brother se 600 yet use my amazon link down in the description below to purchase your se 600 it helps the channel out a lot and this video is for everybody who wanted to see me stitch a design directly on to a shirt using the brother se 600 sewing and embroidery machine and if you like what you're seeing so far give this video a thumbs up now guys this is not a commercial-grade machine so you're not gonna get like commercial grade results but for the price of the machine I think you will get pretty good results once you experiment and you do and you have the proper settings that you want as you guys can see right now because I have my backing on it's giving the material like a solid type of it's not letting it flex a lot it's not allowing it to flex a lot and that's what's creating the making it not want to pucker and stuff like that you know so look I mean you got no pulling no pinching nothing like that so far and every design is not going to be the same guys because a lot of time to design what it starts at the start at the beginning you can't turn a crappy digitized design into into a beautiful work of art stitched out on a shirt it starts with a digitization if it's digitized right and you're gonna be able to do this if it's not digitized right there you go you're not probably won't be able to do it alright so got to make sure you get it digitized right alright so now it's stitching out the top layer going from side to side and we're using the method where we stitch out in one direction and then it's going to cross stitch over top of this in another direction to fill it in so that we have a nice solid structure a nice solid background on the shirt without any white peeking through or with as little as possible white peeking through so I'm just gonna let this stitch out guys and if it's your first time here once again subscribe to the channel you never know what you might learn give this video a thumbs up I greatly appreciate it it helps a channel out a lot and don't forget to visit the merch store guys leave your comments in the comment section down below like I said no puckering right now so we're just gonna keep track of this and see what happens you right back if you haven't done so already please hit that like button I greatly appreciate it thank you still rolling still rocking and rolling moving and grooving little puckering no pulling on the design so far so let's keep our fingers crossed cause like I said all designs are not created equal all designs are not the same but if you like the way this is going and if you've learned anything in the video so far if not if if not anything you learn about about using the tension wheel right the lower the number the less tension the less tension the less pulling the less pulling the less the bobbin thread this the bobbin thread is peeking through the top as you guys just know we're using white bobbin thread and you see no white peeking through the top at all all right I know sometimes I do my my patches and you guys see the bobbin thread pulling that's because I'm just demonstrating things to you guys and we got to stop slacking on the videos and I got to do everything like everything to the tee from now on and give a better effort guys because you guys are really starting to come through and show out for me and I greatly appreciate it so much and I want to teach you guys how to do this stuff and how to do it correctly with no problems and I've gotten a lot of people obviously you guys are really interested and I know people want to not make the pack I always suggest making the patch first cutting it out and then sewing it on to the garment that's my preferred method but like I said I have done this before I've done this excuse me I started stitching directly to garment last year when I first got the Machine and played around with a lot of settings and last year when I first started doing it on the black bear tank tops for those you guys remember that one I wasn't doing this method I wasn't doing it like this so like I wasn't this good I should say so there was a little bit of covering maybe a lot of puckering in the black bear shirts but they were still selling and and still did good I'm gonna rerelease them and we're going to have them like this no puckering no pulling all right I still think it's a great tank top straight design check it out on this gun in the store and just know that if you order one you're gonna get quality like this with no car you know pulling all right Allen eweek.com help support the channel buy some channel merch if you guys want to buy some patches at a low cost head on over to the store man I don't know what's in store you can buy a memory stick with 50 designs on it my memory stick with 30 members to go to 20 whatever you need and you can buy designs for just $1 whatever you need guys all right so I'm gonna let this new stitch out finish stitching out and I'll be right back hey guys if you haven't subscribed to the channel yet please take this moment to hit the subscribe button and also hit the post notification bell so you can be notified every time I upload a new video it helps me out a whole lot more than you know it thank you alright and this part right here is just about finished up guys so as you guys can see still nice and flat on the shirt no puckering no pulling looking good on the design like that and we've seen right now it's time to switch colors we're going to switch to the black and since black is going to take seven minutes so let's switch out our thread here just gonna down below we're going to pull this up and then the thread already loosened up you see this nice and solid background there it's not super solid I can still add some more density on there but for the design and what it's doing I think this is accurate I wouldn't want to add any more density to it I think this is sufficient alright so let's add our black thread up it's up here being careful to thread it properly because sometimes when you're in a rush you tend to make mistakes so try not to make mistakes and thread it properly through here although of that just to add some tension on there to get some resistance boom right through there pull that all the way through when you're doing a shirt you kind of want to be as thorough as possible you don't want to leave any room for error because this is a shirt this is your money you paid for this shirt right so the more you mess up one the less profit so you want to make sure that you are dotting your T's and crossing your eyes when it comes to loading up the machine just little stuff you know and let's see once again if we see any white thread peeking through because this is an important part of the design the black border and as of right now I can honestly say that the threads are meeting right where they need to meet right in between I don't see any white thread peeking through let's cross our fingers and hope that remains true to the whole design and if you like what you're seeing right now guys stitching directly onto a shirt give this video a thumbs up for the YouTube algorithm I greatly greatly appreciate it and subscribe to the channel because I might just you know I might just go nuts with this new segment and just start doing t-shirts just doing crazy designs all over t-shirts so stay tuned for that guys subscribe to the

I want to talk a dance what you wanted to we could talk about it all day listen action you need action to get paid alright investing yourself investing your business se6 is doing it I got to be honest with you guys this machine in my opinion and what it's capable of doing it's not a professional machine it can't do everything but for what it can do I honestly think and I'm gonna say this and grab yours before brother hears this brothers hear this I think this machine is underpriced III I'm going to say as far I'm gonna I think this machine does embroidery machine is underpriced guys I mean it's not that durable as a matter of fact we're to have a plastic body it is very durable you know it's very durable but I'm saying it from the perspective of what it's capable of doing for what it's capable of doing I think this machine is underpriced and I think this machine can do a lot has a lot of functionality can sew it can embroider it can stitch directly to garment and the big problem is people don't know how to use the machine if you can operate the machine if you can get the machine to do what you needed to do then you'll get results like this it just takes a little bit of practice a little bit of time and the machine will do what you want it to do all right you got to know the settings know how to put it in no I would wear out a threaded all that stuff the intricacies of the machine and you will get results like this every single time guys I'm telling you well you think I've been making videos on this like all the time it's a good machine and look what I'm look what I've done look what I've done design is just about finished out and we are going to pull out our design and see what we got on the screen it says that we're done we're finished and boy during press okay ready to stitch out another one take it out see what we got guys swipe one to release that just take it out all right now check it out guys this is on a t-shirt all right on a t-shirt all right obviously we're gonna make the right cuts should have cut this off beforehand before I touched off the red part let me see if I could pull it through sometimes you can pull it through gotta make sure you grab only the thread you want to pull through though cuz I grabbed a little piece of new threat so so already I messed that up alright so pull that through clip that mess that top part up right there so don't throw a mine that I did that house so obviously you're gonna clip all these clip all these alright clip all this and then after we clip it we're gonna loosen up from the hoop and we're gonna see if it shrivels back sometimes if you hoop it too tight which I know I didn't if you hoop it too tight and if you pull too much on the like on the edges when you're hooping it it's gonna pull the material and when you undo pit you're gonna notice all the that's why you want to hoop it just right you're gonna notice all its gonna spring back it's gonna pop back like a rubberband and you're gonna have a lot of a lot of puckering alright but I don't think I did that there and this does not in this case I just laid the hoop down on it I'm just trying to get this one little piece right here without getting that blue thread and this is the problem with um with stitching it out loose because you're trying to get these little threads I might have to get this off-camera take my time get it off camera there you go boom got it guys on a shirt looking good just messed up right there when I pulled that but I'll just Chum that looking good guys now let me loosen it up let's see what it looks like once we take it off nice and smooth no part right look at us alright look at that I see it I see it well I see what you're talking about see what you I see what saying you saying hey dub is pulling a little bit it's pulling a little bit here and there I mean guys we already know it's not gonna be perfect because it's not a high-end machine but look at the results we got look at the results we got and what you're gonna do is now you're gonna come underneath here pull that right there grab your scissors you're just gonna cut it cut it straight across make sure you don't cut the shirt though all right I'm gonna cut it straight across the tax should be turned up the light a little bit see the edges just gonna cutter straight across like that come on this side repeat it on the side cut on this side don't have to be perfect you know I'm gonna side it right back looks good looks official looks like an embroidery and embroidery right on the front very very minimal if any pull guys what are you talking about here very very minimal if any pool well that's it a little bit of a little bitter a little bit nothing serious all right so that's about it guys let me know if you like this video let me know if you think I did good got the dubnation on the t-shirt looking Sophia let me turn down its light a little bit so you guys see it better I want turn off yeah so okay on a t-shirt looks good DTG direct the garment embroidering on a t-shirt write down hood and I forgot to clip the black right here but that's okay looks good patches solid right what do you guys think let

receive this shirt enjoyed the design after seeing Aquaman the desert scene when he's wearing one like this and this one works perfectly it's got a real nice feel to it unnecessarily soft but within its kind of rougher field there's still a softness to it it's a really nice material these drawstrings have these owls on them without them the string is going to fray out you don't want that if it were just that but instead as this sleeve it works pick it up nice natural nice material", "nEfcUbDoTDE": "[Music] [Music] oh [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] so [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] tough [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "RyFrfEOybmM": "hi they so I've got a review for you for the grandma pima cotton t-shirts for men I'm gonna be focusing on the durability aspect which might not get on some other reviews I've actually been wearing these t-shirts for about five to six months and I've been for about 20 wash cycles now so I'm starting to get a pretty good idea of the actual durability and how long they're likely to last so as you can see the shirts are lasting really well it's still pretty much looking as good as the day I bought them which is great because they do cost a little bit more than you can get on the Internet I'm going to actually compare them to some other shirts I bought at the time which were about the price and you gotta see the difference in the curability of the different shirts here's another groaner one but from the one I'm wearing obviously the the seams are still lying really nicely if I tried on it I can seems to meet up really nicely the collar is still nice and flat it's still looking great it's still feeling nice and soft the claw has stayed really nice and true I'm really happy now I'll compare with next which is another online clothing retailer so these shirts are their third of the price of the groans this is one that I put into the rotation are pretty much the same time as these other Greiner shirts as you can see the collar is starting to come apart a little bit now on this next shirt and this seems and why I'm not sure how well you can see it but the seams just don't sort of lie flat anymore if I try to get if I try to get the same to come together here then the other scene no longer really meets you know and you really notice that when you try to all have it now it's kind of hard to get it to to just sort of lie nicely anymore and I've got some other next jets for you it is slightly further along so you can sort of see what will continue to happen to these next shirts see this one they call this kind of gone worse this is a little bit older than the previous one and then you know this is the kind of end game where you know you get that completely completely dodgy collar and this shirt is actually really quite faded as well so yeah I mean obviously it's unfair to compare the ground on one to two these two shirts but in this fair to compare with this one which I've washed about same number of times as this one and this one is definitely holding up a lot better so I think I'm happy to have paid extra money for though for the grinder shirts I really enjoy wearing them they fit me well as far as sizing goes the the next ones are in the slim fit grana just offer you know the regular sizes small medium large etc and the medium fits me really well I'm one hundred ninety seven centimeters tall so yeah in summary really happy with the ground shirts and my key concern was the the durability and that they wouldn't find that they wouldn't shrink that the collar would stay nice and flat and that seems to be happening so far after about 20 washes about five or six months wearing them about once a week all right I hope you enjoyed the review", "ylepXks8Ti8": "what's going on YouTube welcome back to the video blog one more time dogs and friends right gang real quick video in this one got some Gucci stuff in one's room once fake which one do you think it is I'm gonna give you a real quick look into these items so that you can kind of decide make a decision and then we're going to look and see how we can tell which one is the fake and which one is the real okay listen check [Music] [Music] right guys that's it you've had a look at way for the t-shirts which one do you think is real which one do you think is fake not going to keep you guys in suspense for any longer the one which is the fake one is actually this one right here this is the fake right here this is the fake Gucci t-shirt which I actually got from eBay wait for it guess how much I paid a hundred quid oh listen I want to repeat that 100 quid for this fake right here now the funny thing about this fake is the guy that was filling it was had 12 he has 12 items and he sold every single one for a hundred quid but let me just get into it let me just show you guys exactly how you can tell these two items are fake okay what first things first if we look at this Gucci label that you can see on the neck now what get you've gone and done it they've gone impor here on the neck and you can see the red stitching it goes across guys okay it goes across it's quite straight it's a straight line across if you look at the fake one they've put it in a diagonal line to the side okay that's the first thing that I would notice you would always see Gucci do it in a straight line if you look at the stitch print you can see that it's going across like that okay you can see the little kind of grooves and the lines going across and if you look at the fake one you can see there are lines going across in one direction but if you hold it this way you can also see there's little kind of slight lines going across in the other direction as well I know that's really going to be quite difficult to spot but just to look carefully at the Gucci just look carefully at the Gucci you can see that it's only going one way these little faint lines in the background it's going down look at this one again you can see it looks like it's going in multiple directions not only just down okay also if you look at the main Italy tag you can see it's in black it should actually be in white in the background and the writing is in black okay it shouldn't be all black like that the next thing is if you look at the actual Gucci logo to the front itself this is actually meant to be like a vintage inspired top so they've actually got an affair get out the colors here people on the Instagram they looked at this one because the print of the fake one seemed a lot more clearer than the original a lot of people thought this was the genuine one if we look at it the the print is just too bright man the colors too bright okay should beat up right should be a little bit faded so if you're looking at some Gucci shirts and you're seeing that it's really bright and it reads out then that's incorrect guys okay the whole print even the gold bit it's it's a little bit faded okay the other thing to notice as well is that on the screen print at the use for the t-shirt you can see that the print itself is just too thick okay is too thick it shouldn't be that thick look at the size of the real are look at the size of the fake are totally different if we look at the size of the Gucci logo you can see that it's a little bit smaller than the original okay it shouldn't be as big as this it's a little bit smaller if you don't have a genuine one next to it it's going to be really difficult to tell so that might be a tough one another quick way to look at is to simply look at the labels inside if you look at the label as you can see there's lots of information it's a nice long slim tag it says Made in Italy right there and we've got lots of information now this is a three hundred and forty pound shirt and I'm a little bit disappointed that Gucci haven't taken time out to put them all off indication labels especially now that Gucci has got a lot bigger over the years so obviously there's going to be more counterfeit especially around the Christmas time and why haven't DG implemented 30 logo or a hologram or something to help their fan base identify that the items are genuine because remember what if you have a duty top and you want to sell it and you have to receipt anymore or something like that you know this should be something on this garment that can help the second-hand market which I feel is a bit of a letdown brands like Gucci that haven't taken precautions to protect their items fully and to be honest with you it's the pre-owned clothing market that's really messing up these brands with the counterfeit so you should really be looking into stuff like that you can see there the tags are completely different really really lazy tag on the fake it says they're made in Italy by it's not it's it's made in China they even try it long tag and on the side there similar to what like Montclair have a little kind of small slim label and it's got the size large there so here they've actually attached the size label on to the label itself and it's it's it's in black so it's in the wrong color okay this very much looks like an old Gucci tag to me doesn't like one of the new ones this is the new Gucci tag right here so you can see it's a lot more slick but more modern-looking compared to the fake label I mean to be honest it's a really plain t-shirt so there's not too much else to differentiate between this two I mean what I would say is that this cotton hair is a really really nice feeling cotton it's so nice and even look at it you can see it's almost like a little bit opaque and a little bit see-through but it's got a really nice feel to it I would give it that I mean 440 it's got to have something that really kind of stands out is it where free fully hell to the no but there you go some people are going to end up you know that's that shirt right there is more or less sold out in most places now you you know really see me running around and design a t-shirt too tough to be honest with you it's not really my thing that's it going on out there lots to do so yeah hope you enjoyed it like subscribe share with a good stuff yeah peace out [Music]", "extYCOioRe0": "first up protesters clashing today in salem with one group supporting president donald trump the other supporting black lives matter this comes after a large trump rally gathered in oregon city let's get outside short fox 12's drew reeves who's been out there following this rally or these multiple rallies for us a lot going on out there drew he joins us now live with from salem with the very latest drew yeah it's definitely been a changing situation out here in salem when we first arrived things were fairly calm and it was a larger group of trump supporters but that definitely kept growing and growing once we arrived here and the group across the street of people who were saying they were out supporting black lives matter was fairly small but about 20 minutes or so after we got here that's when things really started to change we saw trump supporters rushing across across the street after that group of counter protesters they had said that the counter protesters were firing paintballs at them we saw them rush after that crowd they were firing paintballs at them as well and then from there things just kind of continued to escalate we then saw a man who was standing in the middle of the street holding a black lives matter sign and the group told him he needed to get out of the street then took his sign and in response to that he stripped down and was maced by the crowd a very interesting situation and then another time the group rushed after counter protesters across the street from them firing at paintballs and tackling them to the ground that's when we actually saw two arrests police made from the group of trump supporters that rushed after that person we saw two of them arrested and again this all followed a pro-trump rally that gathered in oregon city at clackamas community college originally we thought that group might be traveling to portland but the caravan then got on to the highway heading south and we heard there was a rally that was happening in salem and some of the group was going there we did see many of the caravan members drive off at woodburn and turned back around but then some of them came out here to salem and that's when we continued to see the crowd growing and growing now before we did leave oregon city i was able to talk to some of the protesters and ask them if they were worried about clashes or violence after what happened at the last pro-trump rally they told me that they were concerned about that but also felt that they needed to stand up for what they think is right it's scary but i feel like it's very necessary to support the founding principles of our country and that right now that's trump [Music] we have seen that some of the protesters out here are armed we've seen some ar style rifles we've also seen lots of paintball guns and baseball bats as well most of that has been from the crowd in support of trump it doesn't really seem like there are many counter protesters out here anymore and things have definitely calmed down uh kind of in the last half hour or so we've definitely seen these things calming down but we'll continue to be out here and not really sure how much longer this group plans on staying out here but again it does appear that the counter protesters have left the area reporting live in salem drew reeves fox 12 oregon", "gdhCjMzsIy8": "[Music] hello and welcome i'm josh with us cutter and in today's video we're going to be showing you some sublimation temperatures and press times i've created an updated sublimation temperature guide to go along with this video that you can download and follow along and also keep handy if you're considering getting into sublimation or just starting out be sure to check out our before you buy videos that i did for the sawgrass printers part 1 covers everything you would want to know about the printer's ink and then even shows you the setup and installation while part 2 shows you the finer details of how the software works i also plan to update and re-release the part 2 video whenever sawgrass releases the next big update when we also have some content over the horizon that goes into the finer details of sublimation toner so make sure you subscribe to the channel to receive all that future content so let's go ahead and take a look at that sheet underneath our fancy new logo we've got a few links that you can click that'll take you to our selection of blanks and other stuff followed by a very important disclaimer that i'll quickly read to you the following chart should be used only as a starting place producing quality end products is a matter of suitable substrates a calibrated heat press smart color management following manufacture guidelines testing and practicing so that's some very good information it is so valuable that i also put an asterisk next to the press time and temperature columns to hammer this point home even more you should always look for additional or specific directions from the manufacturer when pressing a new substrate on this guide you will notice that each item has a range of suggested temperatures and times so again always check to see if there's additional instructions that come with your blanks the more instructions you have i can guarantee the less time and products you'll end up wasting having to figure it out underneath that i made sure to put a link to our youtube channel and this video so let's get to the chart we've got a few categories here going across the top starting with substrate followed by press time then temperature pressure and then some tips and tricks you might be wondering why i have a range listed for the press time and then also some of the temperatures this is because some substrates and some inks require a different temperature for example if you're using sublimation toner the suggested starting temperature is at 380 degrees fahrenheit for all types of materials unless specified otherwise by a manufacturer some users using ink also prefer to use lower temperatures but with higher press times to ensure that there's no chance of the design to get yellow like you see here when i burnt this early draft of the sheet onto this mug the very first item that we have listed here is the ceramic mugs the press time range is anywhere from 150 seconds to 210 seconds the temperature is anywhere from 370 degrees fahrenheit to 400 degrees fahrenheit your pressure is going to be medium around 40 psi and some tips and tricks are start the countdown timer when the mug and mug press are up to temperature what i mean is when you put a mug inside of it and start it up it's going to cool the mug press down a lot like you see here so wait until it gets up in one of these ranges i usually wait till it gets around like 370 like you see here and then i start my countdown timer so that is what i mean by that and then obviously remove the transfer once the mug is cooled down next we have the metal substrate and now when we're talking about metal we're talking about flat surfaces we're also talking about you know round surfaces like mugs or a cup and all colors white silver stainless steel and bronze so this is going to be much quicker because metal conducts heat much fatter than ceramic does so 60 to 80 seconds 375 degrees to 400 degrees fahrenheit around 40 psi medium temperature heat resistant tape around the edge of the transfer is really helpful and then use a non-stick sheet when possible that way you don't have it directly making contact with your platen so up next we've got the ceramic and glass tiles and this is going to be a little bit different and you notice we've got a big time difference here temperature is going to be like everything else you know 380 degrees to 400 degrees fahrenheit uh 40 psi medium but with these you want to be very careful you want to press them from the back you know transfer side face down like into the silicon pad so that means you really want to have your silicon pad preheated and then be very careful when you're pressing it down using too much pressure could cause the tile to break now back to that first tip you know press the towel face down into the transfer you don't have to do that because personally i don't you just really want to be careful when pressing it because it could break and you know too much heat could cause it to yellow so be careful when you're doing that next you have your polyester fabric and then we also put the mouse pads here because you know they're kind of covered in polyester fabric now the recommended time for these is 45 seconds and as you can see it has the standard sublimation temperature range of 380 degrees fahrenheit to 400 degrees fahrenheit with the normal medium pressure so nothing special there but with this you want to look for a tighter knit and higher white point for better colors and what they mean by that is you know tighter knit means you don't have any like loose threads coming up because if you have a tighter knit and less loose threads you're going to get a sharper image that's the key to getting a sharper image on a shirt you're not going to get as sharp as you would like say on a ceramic or metal surface so that's why you're not going to see as many options in the sawgrass print manager for just polyester fabrics but again please check out that before you buy video part two now up next is an item that i personally wanted to put on there because i received a lot of questions about how to do this one and that's the square sequin pillowcase we're going to press it for about 45 to 55 seconds anywhere from 380 degrees fahrenheit to 400 degrees fahrenheit with medium pressure and you want to use a pressing pillow and a non-stick sheet to get the best results here the cloth side can also be used for sublimation so make sure you do the design on that too now i'm going to skip the soft link t-shirts and the vapor apparel because they're just like doing normal polyester fabrics we just left them on here because they're very popular on the search results but i'm going to go to the uni sub products and these are going to be like your metallic blanks and stuff just want to peel off the plastic coating if there's one present and then you know peel the transfer away as soon as possible it's just a very distinct product that we did carry at one time and i wanted to make sure that we left that on here then finally i wanted to talk about the fr plastics or flame retardant plastics now what these are are plastics that have a higher melting point that won't melt when you heat press them around like 380 degrees to 400 degrees fahrenheit basically these plastics are sublimatable because we're going to be applying a lot of heat to them these have a lot of different instructions even the square sequin pillowcase uses a type of plastic like this so that's going to be pretty much the basics for these as you can see this list will cover your sublimation toner as well as your sublimation ink but it's still just a starting guide so make sure that you look into the manufacturer's specifications for whatever blank that you're using well it seems like a good time to wrap this up as always if you have any questions about any of the

weeding or maybe check out the heat press video that we made have yourself a wonderful day take care", "c-BnQotQglQ": "hello hello we are going to do just a quick video showing how to use the designs I make and sell on my Etsy shop that are for waterslide you just print and cut them on to waterslide 4 cups and stuff I don't know if I have any out here ok like these are printed on waterslide you would let your machine cut it out and then you would put it on a cup but you can also use the same files and have it sublimated onto material so we are going to do a quick video on how to do that I already have a file that I want to use to print so I'm gonna open it up and when you print these you need to make sure that your image is mirrored so this is the image that I'm gonna do and this design here is one of my waterslide images so I'm just gonna flip it so that it's backwards we're gonna go up to print and then of course I'm gonna tell it to print to my sublimation printer the settings that I use to do this it is the text our paper that I'm gonna print on which is a special sublimation paper you can print directly just on regular copy paper and it works just fine but I'm gonna go up and I'm gonna do plain paper high-quality and I'm gonna tell it to go ahead and print while that's printing I'm gonna move you guys over here and don't look at my workspace it's a wreck okay so the directions for what I'm doing is I use the spray so that I am able to sublimate onto cotton fabric because sublimation is normally only good on polyester but you can buy special liquids that this is a concentrate so you mix 1 ounce of this liquid to I think 7 ounces of purified water or whatever so and then you would spray it on your garment of course you want to have it completely dry because if it's not brought dry it will burn too it'll turn like a brown yucky color it will burn to it so it needs to be completely dry we have our heat press going so I have to wait for that warm up but anyway you spray it down I put mine in the dryer to let it dry and like this is one that I did this morning anyway he let it dry when it's ready to go we will move on to the next step but I'm waiting for the heat press to finish heating up but in the process while that's doing the heating part they also offer other things that you can do sublimation on this is a printable HTV and it is made for 100% cotton it's called sub laughs Lex and I found it on actually Jenna found it for me on Amazon but it is the sub low flex - OH - and this is what this is also one of my designs that is on my Etsy store this is it is a vinyl so you would all again print it backwards weed out the white area because you don't want any of the white you want just the design so after you wheat it you put it on top of your shirt follow the directions of course and this is what it comes up to be they have one more let me find that shirt this shirt was done with it is a special paper but you print on again it is for cotton because sublimation you can do on polyester you don't need all this extra these extra things are to be able to do it on cotton fabric because cotton shirts are more common than a polyester shirt but it comes you get a special paper and then there's a powder so once you print out on this paper you get a little bit of the powder and you make sure the powder covers every part of the ink while it's still wet and then you kind of dust it off then you would set this paper under the heat press you don't close it down you just set it in about two inches I mean let it sit in there for about 30 seconds and then once it's done then you would put it on your shirt and go up but it comes with instructions so that's another way you can do it and this is what this one looks like it's also a shiny and you can kind of hear this one but this is a cotton shirt so and it does sublimate perfectly fine to it I don't want to show you all of the image because it's not my image so it's one that I found and I colorized I thought it was really really cute but it looks really great once you put it on your shirts and it took a lot of trial and error to get the colors the way that I like them doing different settings printing different papers I have bought several different papers but regular printer paper works just fine let me show some of these images okay so this is regular printer paper and the ones down here on the bottom that are really light this is also done just regular printer paper so it does do the color but you can tell the difference in color when you get like the special sublimation paper and then regular printer paper like you can see the difference just look at the flowers the difference in the color of the flowers they're kind of like pastel very soft here and then they're nice and vibrant here so there is a difference but it does work either way doing regular or buying the sublimation paper the sublimation paper isn't that expensive I think you get like a hundred sheets or maybe 110 sheets for I don't know less than $15 so it's not really that expensive I'm gonna go ahead and let my press finish heating up when it's done I will be back and we will finish this video okay now that the press has come up to the instructions on this particular way that I'm doing it state to pre pressure shirt for 10 seconds with very firm pressure so we're gonna go ahead and pre press and then here's our image so we are going to make sure our shirt is lined up to be able to put our image why don't you have your image add your protective and this is butcher paper that I buy I think it was I don't know it's not a huge role I ordered it online from Sam's Club comm so anyway it we are going to press for 60 seconds and this particular product says you press it it 90 degree are three hundred ninety degrees very firm pressure for a 60 second so that's what we're gonna let it go ahead and do and sublimation can be done on pretty much anything nowadays like they have sublimation products for all kinds of stuff the pop things on the back of your phone the little metal rings that you can put your finger through to hold your phone they have phone stands phone cases blanket shirts I've done acrylic photographs they have metal photographs I have a catalog of just a ton of stuff that you can sublimate on so the printer that I got is a Sawgrass SG 400 and I got it from us cutters it shipped very quickly like I had it within a couple of days and I've actually had no problems with it absolutely love it and it was just under 600 ollars I want to say it was five hundred and seventy-five dollars so we're done all we're gonna do is peel off our turn you guys shut that down okay I'm gonna turn it and there's paper in there I don't like it you're supposed to put something in there so it doesn't bleed through so that's it that's what you get when you're done and that is sublimation like I said the design the frog design I actually designed the whole thing but I sell the Frog design on my Etsy store it's all one word it's my crafters anonymous and I will put a link to it in the description but that is it this is done with my designs on sublimation this is also sublimation so I hope this helps thanks for watching guys", "CXVKfl0BnYY": "Let\u2019s take a moment to talk about\nwhy white 100% polyester T-shirts are best for sublimation. You can use cotton-poly blends,\nbut remember that sublimation dye does not adhere to cotton. This is a 100% cotton shirt\nwe tried to sublimate. Not very nice, is it? It can actually look\nworse after washing. This is a 50/50 cotton-poly\ntee that we tested as well. It looks way better! The colors aren\u2019t as bold and\nvibrant as 100% polyester,  but it works. In fact, some people like\nthis because it has a cool vintage look to it. This shirt will fade a little\nmore after a few washes, but not too much. A good rule of thumb is that\nthe more cotton in your blend, the more fading you\u2019ll\nget after washing. If you have a colored\n100% polyester tee, you can still sublimate it. However, the color of the tee\nwill heavily affect the final look. For example, we have the same\nimage sublimated onto this blue 100% polyester shirt. The darker parts of the transfer\nlook good, but the lighter parts get lost in the blue. Also, where the graphic\nshould be white, it\u2019s blue. This is because sublimation\nprinters can\u2019t print white, so any white is left as a blank\nspace on the page.

I'm Kenny with embroidery library t-shirts are the most popular garments to embroider on in this video I'll talk about designs how to position them stabilizer and hooping so you will get excellent results t-shirts are usually made of cotton or a cotton and polyester blend wash and dry the shirt before embroidering on it to get all the shrinkage out of the way choose designs that are light with open areas light designs drape beautifully on t-shirts designs that have a lot of stitches will drape poorly and you may see puckering too this wolf design looks much better on heavier fabric like a sweatshirt where you place the design is largely up to personal preference I'm using a template or a printout of a design to arrange on the shirt traditional placement has the top of the design about three inches down from the neck centered between the left and right seams that measurement may be different if you're working with a very large shirt or a very small one after you have the template placed where you want to stitch the design mark the center point and the vertical and horizontal access lines these marks will be used when hooping turn the shirt inside out spray a piece of cutaway stabilizer with temporary adhesive and smooth that on the back of the area that will be embroidered now turn the shirt right-side out again slide the outer hoop inside the shirt press the inner hoop in place lining up those marks on the shirt with the marks on the hoop roll the excess shirt up so it doesn't get caught while embroidering use clips to keep the excess out of the way embroider the design a size 11 or 75 11 embroidery needle will work well t-shirts are stretchy so cutaway stabilizer is the best choice I don't use tearaway stabilizer on t-shirts because that type of stabilizer tears away with the needle perforations and that leads to gapping and misaligned stitches after you finished embroidering the design turn the shirt inside out and cut the excess stabilizer away I leave about 1/2 inch around the design that looks great the design is light and open so the fabric is draping very well here's a crafty design on a v-neck t-shirt for the crewneck example I measured down from the neck but for this I place the design about two inches down from the point of the V usually designs are added to the front of a shirt but for this one I embroidered a pair of angel wings on the back t-shirts come in every color you can imagine and it's fun to experiment with different thread colors in this example i embroidered butterflies in bright thread on a dark navy blue shirt on this shirt i embroidered the filigree swirls in a color that's just a bit brighter than the shirt but use more contrast in the words fabric lover thanks for watching today for machine embroidery

going on everybody today we're gonna be going over various white tees and a bunch of different brands in pursuit of the perfect white tee if that's even possible to him I mean I've gone through so many different types of white tees from different stores different fits different prices alright so hopefully this video eliminates any future guessing games when it comes to the white tees you ready to talk about these men let's go [Music] all right team first whitey that we're gonna review is a classic white tea from pains man from what I remember when are these hain tea is growing up once you get them a little bit dirty you throw them in the washing a dryer they're done the color pretty much turns into like shrivel the bacon real ugly that's why the price is 5 for $20 like you cannot beat that price right there deals and after trying it on I'm gonna have to go and say the cotton is not that soft okay okay well what about the supreme one though okay that's another slavery the supreme one is for hypebeast aesthetics only wear Hanes I feel like they have a lot of brand recognition you know Payne's class or in Jordan it's a beautiful thing I put them up there with fruit of the Loom and whatnot but as far as the product itself I'm gonna have to go rate it at 5 how to change whatever you man the fit was a little bit off I'm gonna have to go and say solid because you do get five t-shirts for 20 if you just want to cover yourself up these are the ones that go ain't ease are definitely the ones that you wear to go to sleep in yeah generally not something robbed with a nice pair of denim definitely there's a go to safe bet go to sleep don't on your girlfriend type team your girlfriend okay alright so that wraps it up for the hangs white tee I think we could find something better I agree alright alright so next white team we got one from the rail department in North Sean I would say off the bat supersoft we already tell it is a lot better than the Hanes one you can tell right that with the price point to 430 that's not cheap at all that's kind of steep when it comes to a white tee but I'm thinking this is the one when you could wear not just to sleep so right off the bat looking at this white tee right here you could tell the fit is a little bit different the caller is a little bit more structured than the Hanes white to you that's definitely one thing when it comes to quality the white tee then I look at is the collar and you can't really see through the fabric like the Hays white so you can see I think you can foresee the problem if the nipples are Perkin the hanky is gonna show so after trying on this t-shirt I'm gonna have to go and say the fit is pretty good maybe like an 8 out of 10 okay it does feel pretty trendy the mid section is not too baggy it's not flowing all over the place overall when it comes to the rail white teeth I'm gonna compare to the Hanes you're gonna see this white seat hung up in my closet more I see what you mean cuz it hangs ones you're gonna play ball at the park with and then the rail t-shirts you're gonna you're clark's with alright so there we have it the rail department white team I would say worth checking out if you guys want a very soft nice fitting white team mover right along we got a pretty popular one that a lot of people get cuz it's so damn cheap we got forever 21 White T's for 4 bucks just feeling the Chi right now I wouldn't even call this con it has like slight like cardboard tight it leaves a little bit Scratchy let me tell you one thing just observing it before even touching it it does have a trendy look it does it almost reminds me of the real one that we just covered but it has the quality and the feel of the Hanes one well I mean that's what you're gonna get from a lot of forever21 products you're gonna get to look down but you're not gonna get the quality oh I've got these over the Hanes one the $4 so their dollar cheaper they look more expensive than they are I see what you mean I see what you mean but you know what am I I don't even put them in the same category the haze or whooping in the park tight white seat though on your girl like you said earlier this is more for like you want to hit the club and look trendy you know right but I don't put them in the same category so there we have it the forever 21 white tee you're gonna get that trendy look but you're not gonna get the quality down but for four dollars you don't really have a seat so next t-shirts we have up or from H&M and for a longest time I'd walk in there and be like why is there two white tees and two different prices one is a premium version it has like a slim fit you know a little bit thicker and kind and the one is just your regular plain $6.99 and white seat I'm not gonna lie I would get the ones out of 69 cuz they're cheaper and I really did not know the difference so for the ten dollar one this is called a crew neck t-shirt and then it also has a slim fit label on them I put this kind of in the category of like maybe that's all Bay white t-shirts you know what I mean like this fits a little bit tighter around the body and everything that leaves are super super short kind of like a euro fee okay I don't know you personally like it I can see what you're saying because the sleeves are kind of small the armpit of late is pretty short I got a long armpit hairs me you're gonna go down and stay away from this one man so I've always gravitated towards the $6.99 one I don't know why I decide the price point I just felt like wallet II was there for the price okay okay so everything on is not Dashie yes that's half the price of a regular screen print very true I do like these because I've always taught about a white tea could only be worn you know underneath the flan oh yeah well underneath a dress shirt but for some reason man I could wear this with a nice denim and they also have another section in H&M called the divided section they have really good white tees as well so also check those out they have a blue tag on them but as far as these white tees one thing I really never liked about the $6.99 ATGM White T's is the color is very wide do you like that I like it the blue chain shop I see fresh clear then ballers man they a not even a baby that's a newborn chain no it really is though this is how I categorize it man I think the big dudes you know the Johnny Simms and I in a weird way consider myself that big dude okay like I've been called a nugget before he's not sure people come in a nugget like a little stumpy so I'm gonna put myself in the category of your big news we like white tees with nice solid color collars I mean so for myself the hnny tees I never really liked them because of that reason I would definitely rate this one part of one of my favorites top three white tees I'd rate it solid nine out of ten I would put this over the rail or this one I just wanted to get this across that just cuz it's more expensive does not make it better from H&M it's not even gonna be the same thing as a cheaper one so you definitely got to try it on see what works for you so the slim fit white tees $9.99 I'm gonna have to say no go from H&M so last but not least we got the Stafford white tee right here you get four for 20 from JC Penney's if you would like and this is the type of color that I was saying that I like man meaning Johnny you know what I mean I really like this I don't like him at all I feel like this is oral Tim we need to rock the fitted over the ears yeah they arise with too much of the champs in footlocker for 420s men I already know off the bat quality is really good the quality is on point very thick you get a really husky collar right here best fit a little bit oversized when you do get them out the pack but these shrink really well after you shrink them okay pretty nice Stepford overall in general they have a lot of variations of their white keys this one is just their standard bit but they also got like the slim fit they also got some like cooling that one so definitely try out all the variations they have they don't all fit the same so overall wrapping up the Stafford white team I'm gonna have to go and say for myself okay as a small little nugget I like the Stafford white to nihilism right would you rate it are we gonna have to break this a nine out of ten there's no perfect white see out there idea no truth if you guys know what Earthlings signature is it's a brand from Costco and may have white team's very similar to this alright so there we have it the Stanford white tee not really for everybody but if you do want that feel of a street wear tight t-shirt go with the Stafford ones wrapping this one up tan what was your favorite white tee that we went over man I'm gonna have to go with the hmm for $6.99 for myself I like the Stafford white tees we get for 4/20 if you want that more like premium cotton feel but if you want more of like a trendy flow wear t-shirt I actually really like the ones from the rail department even though they were 15 bucks you definitely get that soft cotton feel alright so there we have it please leave down in the comments below what your favorite white tee is to wear right now some other brands that you guys recommend shoutout to tan tan for being in video and until next time we yeah boosts our guys save with checking out that video

getting ready to do a shirt and I've had a lot of people asking for tutorials on sublimation and so I thought this would be a good chance to show you how to press a sublimation transfer on a t-shirt or tank top or for the most part any fabrics but the t-shirts seem to be kind of the trickier ones and there's a few little tricks that I've learned they make it a little easier so we're gonna start on the computer just to show you some print settings and how to set it up and and then we'll go from there okay so we're starting on the computer and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to open up a new document and show you right from beginning on how to set it up in case this is the very first time you're printing a transfer I use silhouettes to do so there'd be a whole different set of steps if you're wanting to promote different software but basically when you open it chances are it's going to look like this with your mat they're probably not that so you open it up and it's gonna look like this what we want to do is drag in the design so I'm doing a buffalo plaid mama bear tank top and I want the ping file so if it'll load and tell me what that is well I'm thinking this one yeah so the ping files have transparent backgrounds and that's ideal that there's usually JPEGs available too but the white background sometimes can be a different color and you don't even realize it just barely tint in a different color and then it'll it'll print with a different color so the transparent backgrounds are really the ones that you want and they should be a minimum resolution of 300 dpi which is dots per inch and that's the resolution anything less than that I mean 240 is probably okay but less than that you're going to start to see a pretty big reduction in quality but you just drag the design right into silhouette studio and then you want to set it up to print because we're not cut so this when I do these tank tops I've done enough of them that I do them all 11 inches wide so if you come over here to the transform panel and then this little diagonal arrow looking thing it'll let you select on the graphic and then change the size so you hit the little lock aspect ratio and you change the width to 11 inches and then we can want to go back to the page setup I'm gonna turn the cutting mat off I mean it really is a big deal if it's on but it just bugs me and then we're gonna turn the cut border off but show print order is a big deal because you'll it's gonna tell you if it's gonna print like right now if I printed this see the line the this stuff outside that border won't print even if your paper has plenty of space it will not print if it's outside that border so the border is going to tell you if you've got some sort of print settings that are not set up the way that you want now so this is 11 inches wide I need to do it on 13 by 19 sheet of papers so that it does the whole thing because in 8 and a half by 11 there's the print border goes in just a little bit and so I can't actually make it the full 11 and I actually wanted to show you how to print on a scrap anyway so we're gonna set it up for a 13 by 19 I uh 13 by 19 and 8 and 1/2 by 11 sublimation paper that's the only sizes that I buy I just haven't had the need to get anything in between but there's there's lots of different sizes that you can get but set it to 13 by 19 and then we want to fix this border right here so we're not gonna print it yet but go up to file print and make sure you choose your printer so I have the WUF 77 20 and then you go into preferences and I have pre-set saved so I can just come in here and click on 13 by 19 and it'll have everything that I want but I'll walk you through how to do it so I always print out a paper cassette one just because the settings that I use aren't available on paper cassette to the premium presentation mat if I was if I change this to number two I went to the type the premium presentation mat isn't an option so I put it on cassette one I choose the paper size so 13 by 19 I do it portrait but obviously you can change that to whatever you need and then you go to your paper type and go premium presentation paper mat and then go into quality and hit hi and I think that's it for this tab the borderless I don't turn on one it pops up with a warning and says that the quality might not be as good are on the edges but the issue that I've run into is the sizing tends to be off a little bit and I do print and cut sometimes or I do it alongside vinyl and I want to make sure that it's exactly the size that it should be and when I print borderless it seems to stretch it or something so I keep order less turned off so that's why there's this little line here that doesn't go all the way to the edge of the paper and why I'm doing this on a bigger sheets which I can obviously shrink shrink it down a little bit more but I'm just showing you this way anything so second tab this this document size is going to just automatically match what you had on the first tab color correction you want to go into advanced and hit ICM that's like the internal color profile for the printer itself so it's just the default it's gonna let it use the settings that Epson has set for the printer without having any special changes being made by the software so turn on ICM and then down here turn off high-speed and turn on mirror image by turning on mirror image it's going to automatically mirror it for you so you don't have to do it you never have to worry about forgetting to mirror and with sublimation it needs to be mirrored because you put the design face down onto whatever you're putting it on and so if you don't wear it everything will be backwards so highly suggest clicking that and saving a preset so the preset you can come in here at remove presets and once you have everything set on that screen you could just give it a name and hit save I already have some in here but then that just makes life a lot easier for you so thirteen by nineteen Kosmos that's the ink that I use I did have different ink and so I started saving with Cosmo so I know which ink because some of the settings were different with different inks so if you don't use Kosmos ink do some tests Walmart has fabric for a dollar ninety-nine a yard hundred percent polyester I've done hundreds hundreds and hundreds of tests compare and write it down very carefully and figure out what setting works better best for your ink but for the cosmos this was definitely the best for shirts now I changed up a little bit for mugs but fabrics and stuff the premium presentation met so anyway you hit OK when you hit apply but then you hit cancel don't hit print yet so hit cancel and if you look you see that the print border changed that's what you need to look for if you did something wrong in those settings and that print border isn't lining up like this you need to go back and look at them again this is basically the print border is going to tell you if something's messed up and it happens so I highly suggest turning that on so we have the design and I'm just gonna go all the way up see zoom in just inch it up to the edge here and because I'm kind of OCD we're gonna hit the center button so that it just makes placement easier when you're doing the shirt so I'm centering it and there it's good that's how I want it so we're gonna go back to file and print and hit print except I'm going to show you how to set up the printer first then I'll hit print okay now we need to set up the printer to make sure that it's doing what it should in order be printing the right thing with the computer is gonna be sending it so by default the tray is all closed up so you need to since we're doing the bigger sheet of paper pull it out there's a blue tab over here pull the tab and it'll let me extend the whole thing out and you need to have this one pushed back and this one pushed all the way back so you have the full tray size for the 1319 paper if you're using a different size just look at the lines on here and line them up accordingly now I'm not actually gonna put 13 by 19 in here because I am going to print on a scrap because a lot of people have asked me that so we're dual purposing this little this is 13 inches wide but I cut it off I was probably a pillow I have a lot of squares we're gonna pull off the side there's kind of so I'm gonna use a scrap and you just push it all the way up where the paper would be and you make sure your design is up on the top and paper so prints first and then the rest of its blank the printer will just push it out this blank there's nothing that's trying to do there just make sure there's no design that's going to go down beyond where there's no paper and I'm using a sub paper I get it on Amazon it works great and there's a pattern on the back so you want to print on the white side so you put it facedown you should see the pattern then you know you have it loaded right then push it in and you need to tell the printer what size you're loading don't tell them into scrap just put 13 by 19 in here so 13 my 19 is actually called Super Bee or a 3 plus so for paper size you choose that and for paper type you choose premium matte and it's actually working up on my screen and I have it saved as a paper favorite paper setting if you want to save it go into favorite paper settings choose which setting number you want and then you'd hit edit and go in and choose everything and then hit safe but I already have mine all sorts I'm not going to do that but I choose super be premium Matt okay use and they'll pull those settings in and you get close and you're good to go hold this out because otherwise it goes flying across the room I have my printer up on a big tall dresser it's the only place I have room for this giant printer but pull this out and then it'll catch it for you there's a little on the lid that comes with these I took them off the first day I started printing it's it's not necessary and it was just driving me nuts having to take a lid and put it back off so I keep the lid off all that out go over to either printer and hit print okay so the transfers printed what I like to do now I know I censored it on the page so I'm not really gonna worry about the left and right side but just to show you guys I usually cut it out as close to the design as possible so it's easier to line up on the shirt and I mean you can kind of see through the paper a little bit but sometimes it's just a little bit tricky so just for helping replacement I'm gonna cut off the extra on the bottom just so it doesn't kind of mess with my linemen so what I usually try to do is see the space that I have over here and match it over here with whatever is the lowest part so something like that and I just cut it I try not to put my ruler over that so I don't scratch the transfer itself and like I said I centered it in the software so I'm not gonna worry about trimming the right in the left but if it wasn't centered I would trim both sides too okay so one more thing you wanted to mention real quick make sure that you lint roller your shirt really well there's lint that gets on it in the factory or shipping or whatever and you can't even see it but it will show up blue when you press it and it's bad so lint brush lint roller to the front roll over the back go through a few sheets if you have to just to be extra careful that you don't get any of those little blue flecks on there and one more thing I just thought about the butt transfers I cut mine in squares like I showed you if you still have issues with the square of the paper showing up on the shirt you can try tearing the design out and it gives you kind of more of a feathered line that's a lot less noticeable on a shirt I haven't had to do that honestly I don't like doing that because I feel like I can't get it lined up as well and I got my pressure settings I'm Torri I don't have that problem but if you still have that problem try the tearing out thing that seems to work really well for people as far as the alignment I've heard some people will take a ruler or square and put like a plus sign or a big T on the back of the transfer really lightly in pencil so when you tear it you at least know how to get it level of where the center is but again I don't have to do that the foam kind of solve the problem for me but if you still have that issue that's just an idea if we're gonna try okay so now we can move on to the actual shirt process I do all my shirts and fabrics for the most part 400 degrees for 60 seconds I highly suggest checking the temperature of your press this beast for example is like 25 degrees too hot so I have all these little notes written on a piece of paper on the wall to get it to 400 days I have to set it to 377 so don't be confused by that you need it to be 400 degrees but little infrared thermometer works great make sure your platen is bare if you have tough long on the top it won't I won't read it correctly and you just aim it and press the button so it says 396 $3.99 so it just kind of depends this one is so big and it honestly it's a China piece of crap but it gets the job done but depending on where you shoot the thermometer on the Platinum the temperature is going to be a little bit different here and there but this one it was 399 right in the middle so we're gonna go with that now I use foam for all my shirts I have a couple different sizes I have a whole stack of them I just cut them with scissors I got this on Amazon I think I've heard Joanne's I mean really any craft store should have some foam but the foam gives it a nice soft backing so that you can get even pressure without having to do super high pressure and it helps allow for seams and stuff like that now even with paper underneath I have I've stained all of them just the ink that bleeds through some some things are worse than others this is from black sequin pillow and I had a sheet of butcher paper underneath and it still did that so now I always make sure that I kind of press it for a little bit to try to get as much ink off of it as I can and then I always put paper underneath if for no other reason than to protect what you're pressing so for this this little foam pad is big enough to cover the whole design so I'm going to use the smaller one because then I can leave the the seems to be off of the pad and then the shirt doesn't get quite so smashed sometimes you can see the back part of the tank top pressed into the front part of the tank top and so the smaller one works better but I just wanted to show you I have a full-size one sequined pillows I do on this this full one regular pillowcases waffle weave towels pretty much everything else goes on this bigger one and I never adjust the pressure on this press and they never changed the temperature I have another heat press that is a swing-away it's a lot easier to tweak the pressure on it this one is just a little bit I mean I had to add washers to the front part so that it would allow room and still be level with a foam pad so long story short I would recommend getting a nice he press but this works it's a sixteen by twenty four and I wanted the biggest one that I can afford and this is what it was but anyway so I'm going to take this one off it never press without this because this is pretty much those presses all just I use fabrics and so I always use with the foam pads so what you want to do first is get some butcher paper to go on the bottom I'm sorry you've seen my back but this is a big giant roll but your paper that I got from Sam's Club it's like I think I was like twenty bucks a piece that's big enough to cover the whole bottom platen and you can reuse this I got ink on the last one so I threw it away but I'm gonna pull this forward a little bit just so the top tank top strap can drop back there past the phone and put the phone down cover the top to protect the shirt itself so I have to then weigh the very first thing I do is I pre-press the shirt it gets out any initial moisture so I'm gonna take the tank top try not to burn your knuckles I really do like my swing away if you can afford a really big spoon or I get a swing away but this works so I'm just pushing this down so my seams I know you can't see this but right here is the edge of the foam so these seams from the tank top or not above it so they're not going to get smashed by the press nobody take butcher paper I put it over it and they just press it for a second whoa not a second but a few seconds then I pull it out and set it aside and I spray spray adhesive on the transfer now if there's I'm a little bit of a learning curve with this so I'm gonna show you how to do it this is my super high tech adhesive spring box I just use it over and over again I put it like this on the bottom and so what I'm not using it I just fold it back up and tuck at the bar get my kids labeled it sticky box so anyway put the transfer inside the box and this is the spray adhesive that I have found it works the best please for me I know that Conde sells a spray but their shipping was outrageous this was like 20 bucks at Michaels but you can use to 40% off coupon code so it makes it a little bit more reasonable but the trick is one use the box then you could be a little bit more flowy with it not worry about making a mess not to be as careful but there's a little black mark on the lid make sure it's aimed that way and it will get gummy after every time you use it so I take an alcohol swab which I keep a bunch of them on my windowsill here and clean that tip so that it sprays a nice fine mist if you don't clean that tip you don't have it aimed right it'll start to kind of drip and those drips will wreck your transfer so you can actually see it and know before you press it if you wrecked it and I've done it and I didn't clean it because there was only ten minutes since I sprayed the last one and it messed up so I am clean the tip I have the transfer inside the box I usually will shake it up I usually do a little test spray just on the side to make sure I'm getting a nice good mist and then you just kind of make a cloud inside see you could see the fog I probably should have the window open but the kids are outside playing being loud and so it's like a hundred degrees in here but that's all I do for spring so you pull it out and look at it if there's drips on the design those drips will show up when you press it so look at it and make sure that everything looks like it's got a nice fine mist before you waste a shirt cuz it happens I've done it just something to keep in mind so I'm moving the sticky box and not sure how well you can see this here okay so we're going back to the shirt so we pre pressed it it's sitting here looking all pretty quick thing about sizing I have yet to find some cheat sheet size chart that just tells you what size to make the transfer I measure every single one and just kind of get an idea so I thermometer over here I look at thermometer ruler I look at my ruler I might do this 11 inches I've already done this for I'm showing you I lay down on the shirt and I see where 11 inches would hit and no it's you know probably five inches tall and just kind of eyeball it and that's how I decide what size to make it but then I save it so I don't have to think that through every time I do a shirt so um there's a hair anyway so take your nice sticky adhesive transfer and I'm so I'm I'm big on eyeballing if you want to fold the shirt in half to get like a center line and put a careful crease whatever rulers t-squares there's all kinds of tricks but I just eyeball it and another reason why it's kind of nice to keep the extra edges on there's less gap on the side so it's a little bit easier to line up but I usually go a couple inches down from the neck of the shirt and I look up here these corners so it looks even and then I look at it from top to bottom okay I really don't like picking that up once I put it down but the shirts actually going to my sister-in-law and I don't want to mess it up so okay that looks good too so here's here's the really important parts that'll keep you from messing up a shirt you got to put paper inside the shirt on top of the shirt and under the shirt because it could depending on the design the ink can bleed through the shirt onto the back and I actually like to try to save these big pieces so I put paper underneath it as well so the paint doesn't give on this big sheet I have a stack of legal paper and regular letter size copy paper and that's what I use oh we're gonna cuz it's cheap and it's easy and I don't have to cut it so I take my legal paper and I put one on the press where the design is going to be I've kind of move it around as I need to I put one inside the shirt so this is another reason why I really like the spray adhesive is it'll stay put while you kind of mess around with it and you can line it up on the table and move it to the press when you're done it just it stays where you needed to there is adhesive tape high heat tape but I this big press creates like a suction every time I open it and even with the tape I couldn't get it to not move a little bit and once I got the spray adhesive down I'm sold okay so I can actually feel the paper through the shirt and we can pick it up and sometimes see it a little bit better but you just want to make sure that the paper is covering up so you don't send it through to the back cuz I've done that and then I get it as flat as I can and I grab you could feel the paper on the inside and the paper on top I just grab both and I pick it up and they move it over here to the press which I hate this part constantly fumbling the only for that foam again trying to get this stuff not getting smushed but make sure that the foam is underneath your whole design because otherwise it won't press you need to have good good contact okay then legal paper over the top so it saves this big giant piece of paper I just don't want to waste any more paper than have to cover the whole thing now remember 400 degrees 60 seconds but depending on your shirt you might want to you know you might have to adjust that a little bit but I've done the shirt I did this exact one yesterday so I know that this works so cover the whole thing the paper just kind of helps protect the shirt a little bit if you have a really shiny polyester shirt you could put two or three sheets of butcher paper on there it can help it a little bit but this press has a timer built in on it you just close it and starts counting but one last thing before I put it down I have a lint roller handy and you'll see why okay so now we're going to press it okay lift it slowly because it's it's gonna want to try to suck your paper up and make a big mess pull off and don't panic here you're not in a hurry do this carefully it's okay if it sits on here for a second even if you wanted to let it cool you don't have to like being a panic to rip it off so I'm gonna pull this off recycle bin the recycle bin gets filled up like every day okay so peeling this is important now I know we have spray adhesive but if for some reason you don't get enough on there or whatever it can still shift so just be careful in every step of the way when doing shirts I put my hand now it's hot but it's not - I actually my fingernails I can use my fingernail so I don't burn my fingers but I hold it a little bit in place while I grabbed the corner with my finger and then I peel it it just makes sure it doesn't shift while you're doing it um right when you get it out and pull it off I pull the paper out now I should have done this faster but again this is a really forgiving shirt some shirts are not as forgiving but while it's hot lint roller the crap out of it so this one like I said I've got the pressure down really good in this shirt stupid boy this shirt is is really forgiving that's why I like doing these ones so much but white especially it just seems to be harder but if you lit roller it really well and I'll do a video on towels that's where you see the biggest difference of towels but it helps lift up those fibers while it's hot so that they're not so melted down and then shake it out really good and that helps to but really this shirt this one is so easy this is a thread fast Apparel blizzard tank this is silver and down here is white blizzard they're my favorite super easy to do but anyway Oh turn this press off that's it and look at how good those colors look so I've done tests on all the the paper settings and stuff and the premium presentation Matt rocks now of the Kosmos ink rocks - so that helps I used to use a different brand and I won't name it because there's some people who love it but the blacks were kind of blue and the colors were just kind of randomly off some would be awesome and some wouldn't be so awesome so anyway um that's it beginning to end on how to sublimate a t-shirt just don't rush through it and practice but there's just a lot of little steps and I've I've wrecked all of them missed paper underneath missed part of the platen and so the design was cut off that's why I went for a really big press because it makes life easier in that aspect but but that's it and it's right than the fibers of the shirt it's smooth you know it just works awesome this was actually an SVG file and I went through and made some versions with buffalo plaid and I got like a grunge one or something and I can get links to all of those feel free to ask I can get you links for the tank tops the paper the ink any of it so let me know if you have any questions and hopefully you this helps some of you thanks [Music] you", "9h4Cj26ZZB4": "[Music] [Music] hey everybody welcome to another screen-printing video by cats bit productions thanks a lot for clicking on my video today I really appreciate your time and attention and of course if you like my videos make sure to subscribe to my youtube channel right now alright so try to make this a little shorter than the last one if possible just checking out some more shirts little t-shirt reviews remember that this is very casual it's not supposed to be scientific or anything like that I'm just kind of checking them out letting you know what I think about them casually and that's about it doing a couple test prints just for fun and checking these shirts out so today I have a couple of gilt ins and we have a soft style 64000 I think is the model number and then a guild in 2000 I think is this one and a lot of people know the guild in 5000 so I thought we would look at these two gilded shirts so let's take a quick close up look at the shirt itself and then do a couple test prints alright so this is the Gildan soft style it's like six four zero zero zero 64,000 if that's correct guild and soft style soft style delta t and it looks kind of like a fashion cut you know it's not really boxy and the surface is soft feels pretty soft you know stitching looks pretty good you know if you look at the collar on sleeves and stuff it looks pretty you know centered and well-formed you know I don't see any strings or anything hand you know looks like a decent shirt nicely made feels pretty soft this one probably will fit a little you know tighter than the Gildan 5000 would you know but just checking it out the stitching looks pretty decent and everything looks excuse me looks pretty good and I like the soft feel of this one and that it's not such a boxy cut here's the Gildan 2000 ultra cotton adult t-shirt and this one you know feels a little bit how do you say it's not a soft so you know theoretically it might have a better print surface possibly than the other one we were just looking at again stitching looks pretty good these two specimens that I have here look pretty straight pretty uniform stitching looks pretty good there's a little you know spot of bundled up stitch right there in the collar but that's not too bad up here so that's interesting there's a little wad of fabric or you know thread or whatever okay let's see does this one have a lot not really but there are a couple strings hanging here in those same spots not on this side but this one so that's interesting it's a little piece of thread hanging out over here in the collar on these two you know and then this one has some little wad of thread over here or something I'd have to look at it closer because I'm blind I can't see so but you know looks okay you know so you know but I mean in other words it looks like advice well made sure there may be some I don't know I'd have to see more of them you know to make sure of it you know these are only this is only two out of a lot so who knows but it doesn't look too bad you know the true you know what is it the proof is in the pudding when I try them on and stuff like that you really get a feel for how the garment is made okay so here's the Gildan 2000 ultra cotton adult t-shirt preshrunk 100% cotton Jersey net six ounce t-shirt this one printed pretty well it's not as soft as the other one we're looking at the sixty four thousand or whatever that is they're the soft style so it seems to print pretty well and pretty sharp looks good let's check out the spot color okay so again pretty sharp seems like a decent print surface the knit is good you know for screen printing seems pretty decent you should be able to get some fairly detailed prints all right and then the 64,000 Gildan soft style adult tea again actually you know I was pretty impressed it has a soft you know knit or or feeling to it but it actually printed pretty well I think the this halftone design I like the way printed better than the spa color there could be you know much more of a chance for fibrillation on this shirt alright so you know less ink I don't know it just this one kind of looks better to me I think this this halftone print not sure why exactly not sure why let's see sorry alright so here's the spot color and it printed well I thought it would not print as well as it did honestly like I'm saying but it printed pretty good but yeah maybe you know more of a chance for fibrillation than the than the mm okay so the Gildan soft style 64,000 is a four and a half ounce 100% cotton ring-spun t-shirt its preshrunk knit fabric so yeah so that's probably why it feels a little bit smaller than the mm maybe but we'll take these home and wash them and see what happens yeah okay yeah it's already getting warm here this I had to turn the dryer off already so all right so I've got my specimens here I've got them separated marked just in case you know they're actually pretty different I should be able to tell by the shirts but so yeah I'll bring them home I'll wash them bring them back tomorrow and then we'll try them on and give you the kind of you know what I think about the bottom line of what I think about these shirts and like I said before it's just a casual little look at these to give you any information that I can share just by taking a little look at them and sharing what I see what I can feel you know stuff like that but by no means am I trying to be scientific or find the best shirt to print on or anything like that that's not what I'm doing here I'm just checking out some t-shirts and giving you as much you know casual information about them that I can wash testing and printing on them and just a general kind of feel okay so that's it let's get these done and we'll be back okay so I took both of these shirts here all of these specimens and I took them home washed them inside out you know regular cycle not a gentle cycle or anything and dried them in the dryer tumble dry that sort of thing and so now I'm taking a look at them you see sometimes also you know when you have a t-shirt that's brand new it looks pretty good and then sometimes if you wash it and dry it when it shrinks thinks it can happen as well to the stitching even right so it's interesting to do this and take a look at different shirts just to see but I was actually I was actually impressed with the way the soft style you know the 64,000 soft style adult shirt printed is very soft but it printed quite well and the the mm the killed in two thousand printed pretty well also and you know so now I you know let's take a look at these a little bit close-up of course and then I tried them on and that's really where I kind of get an overall feel for the shirt I'm wondering if the Gildan you know soft style is gonna be really tight as opposed to the mm so let's see if we can take a quick look at the print surface and then we'll try them on this is the guild in 2000 okay and yeah actually I was impressed with the way these washed you know printed and washed I think you know compared to the Hanes you know we did the Hanes review and I just think the print looks better after washing with these gild ins than it did on the Hanes but you know who knows I'm not sure if that's you know did you know what I'm saying it just I don't know for some reason I think I like these better as far as printing and washing them they you know they look pretty good so you know also though I noticed the necks the collar on the mm we'll have to see when we try these on but they look really small so let's see about that this is the Gildan soft style 64,000 6-4 of zero-zero-zero Gildan soft style and again I was actually impressed with the way it printed I thought these would have you know more fibrillation problems and you know you can always have fibrillation if you caused it yourself you know what I'm saying but some shirts are more prone to it than others and even though these were kind of soft feeling it they seem to do quite well with that again the stitching on both of these Gildan specimens the mm and the soft style you know they went on the palate pretty well the stitching looks pretty straight and all that and you know once again the wash you know the way the print looks after the wash I kind of I don't know hey I don't know if it's just weird or if it's just the weird happenstance but I like the way this print looks better washed on these guildenstone I did on the Hanes and you know one of the Hanes was a beefy T which is an expensive shirt and it's supposed to have a nice print surface and stuff and it does and it's a really nice shirt but you know I'm actually impressed with the after wash look of the print on these gild ins so that's interesting oh sorry but okay I just put on the the Gildan soft style you know 64000 or 64000 Gildan soft style of del t and I'm just laughing because it's really tight and this is what I was saying before about sizes you know of shirts each brand and even style within a brand can run differently in the way they're cut so this is a medium you know all the shirts that I'm doing are mediums but this is way too small for me I mean it's I mean it's like yeah if this is if I ordered this as a medium and I'd be like I'd be bummed this is this is way too tight for me okay so that definitely is something you know to be concerned about the collar feels okay it's not it's not choking me or anything but I'm getting choked in the armpits and around the chest very tight and you know that can be uncomfortable sometimes you know for people who aren't into the so let's try out the gilded mm okay so this is the gilt in 2000 and it definitely fits much better it's more of the medium you know the collar the collar is a little bit small as I mentioned earlier I do feel the collar it's interesting the soft style the other shirt the collar felt a lot better this one it's definitely a little bit tighter around my neck but the cut is more generous it's it's more of a medium it's probably right you know since I washed it and it's shrunk so it's probably about right but I have to say that it feels when I first put it on I laughed and I said this feels like sandpaper so it's kind of it has a little bit of a rough feel you might need fabric softener with this shirt you know the soft style Gildan 64000 model was much more comfortable in the feel of the fabric but it was way too tight this one seems okay in the cut the neck is a little tight and it's a little rough or something so interesting things I never actually really you know doing these comparisons like this is interesting for me because I've never done anything like this before so to feel the difference is and and what not myself by trying each shirt on and printing them and touching and working with them is actually more interesting than I thought it would be yeah actually I might suggest this for you as a screen printer the person who sells the shirts you know if you actually were able to try them on and test print them I think it's actually a valuable exercise obviously you couldn't do ever shirt on the market but you could do some of the most popular sellers for your particular print shop yeah so very interesting that's it for today that's all I have I think the these two definitely you know they they pass muster you know they're definitely good shirts professionally made the stitching was good they went on the okay seems to have good print ability good wash ability just the major differences in comfort and feel and the way they fit I think are the most important factors in this little casual review here so I hope you found something valuable in this video I hope it wasn't too long it probably was longer than the first one and I hope the focus was okay because I had to experiment with locking the focus and stuff so hopefully it's okay and you will forgive me for any shortcomings in this video thanks a lot for watching I really appreciate your time and attention make sure to check out cat Spitz screenprint supply.com if you need equipment supplies and of course subscribe to my youtube channel right now thanks a lot for watching we'll see you next time [Music]", "arC41M3Fs4Q": "[Music] hi everyone I'm Jan from pins-and-needles in Cleveland Ohio and so it online and one of the questions during this math challenge is how do i make ties we know that there's hardly no elastic in the world if you have some of you're one of the very few so what we came up with is just taking a man's t-shirt now I don't bring a man's t-shirt with me today so I am just cutting up the bottom of this t-shirt that was in our store it says I don't need therapy I just need my sewing machine now isn't that true so what I'm doing is I want you to lay out a t-shirt rather just imagine in your mind right now a man's white t-shirt doesn't matter what color it is doesn't matter if you're Truman if you're if it's a man's okay we're just taking knit fabric you could also look in your sewing stash and see if you have some t-shirt fabric that uh but I'm trying to do this for the mask people for the the mass market who may not have t-shirt fabric in their stash but I bet you you got a t-shirt you could give up so all I'm doing is cutting across the bottom hem and getting rid of that ham that's not nothing that you have to throw away that's a tie cut it apart and it's a tie so there's no waste here but then what I'm going to do is I'm going to move an inch and a quarter and I'm just going to cut across here one and a quarter inches and I'm going to keep going all the way up my t-shirt following me so what did that do that made me a tube because the front in the back is is cut at the same time so now I forgot a tube here so what I'm going to do now is that measures watch out that measures about 22 inches double so 44 inches but now when I pull it it because all I'm doing is pulling this is your break time this one's got a seam in the sides most of them don't have a seam in the side so now look at how much I've made do see how that coiled so now it is down to 23 it came to me about an extra 12 inches so now you just use that for your elastic use that for your ties if you're making the kind of go here and you're using elastic just make it it's about 8 inches and tie it you don't even have to sew it together just tie it in a double knot if you're going to use them as I have in all my masks they're just the ties and I just use them this one hasn't been pulled yet but to get to get you the idea okay so this coils and it's very soft so you're just going to use your piece and cut it and happen you're done so consider using this for your ties but everybody keeps asking me how do I do it how do I do it I just showed you cut it across pull it it becomes a coil no you do not have to sew this down it washes like a dream it's softer it's easier it's comfortable go for it give up a shirt there the hero today keep sewing the mask folks we're not done with this I know your friends and neighbors still need them we know the hospitals I just got a call this morning from rainbows children's here in Cleveland and they want masks for kids so we are not done with this ballgame I would tell you that I get phone calls from hospitals on an everyday basis asking me for these as well as nursing home Police Department's asking them for them so we're not done keep selling and thank you thank you for all you've done hope to see a real bit real soon [Music]", "ctmeCFqcvjM": "hi so I know that the ring light was reflecting in my glasses but I am struggling to see these days so I wear my glasses a lot more often I'm going to go back to the eye doctor soon and get now reflective lenses so that you just don't see my ring light be in my glasses but I gotta wear them because I can't see but I just started the camera on real quick because I want to distress some shirts today you know bleach em out cut some holes in them rough them up a little bit and I thought since they're kind of in style via Instagram right now that maybe you guys would like to see um I'm just going to just go with it and cut some holes and spray some bleach and stuff on it so I'm gonna do this tea here that I got from I think this guy's from H&M I'm pretty sure it's from H&M and I got it in a large because I wanted it to be long enough to kind of wear you know like as a t-shirt dress kind of and I do always wear like these kind of biker shorts type of things underneath people always ask like are you wearing pants and I'm like some kind of pant so I'm going to do this guy and if you're on the shorter side but you still want to give it like that oversized look but it's just like way too long for you what you can do is cut the bottoms off I'm going to leave the bottom because I am tall so I don't want to take any length off of it because it's already like when I put it on it's already pretty short anyways but if you are on the shorter side you can just cut the bottom of the tee off or as much of the tea as you need to adjust it to the length that you want so the most important thing you're going to need is a pair of scissors fabric scissors would be best just so that it's going to be a lot easier to cut the fabric as opposed to using like dull scissors or just like regular kitchen scissors so get you a pair of so get you a pack so get you a pair of fabric scissors and then of course you're going to need some kind of bleach I am going to transfer the bleach into this little maker forever our spray bottle that was empty and then I'm also going to take the lid off of one of these guys and just put it in the bleach and use it to spray just because I don't I currently don't have any spray bleach so to quickly transfer the bleach into this bottle be careful and then I'm working on just like a craft table that I don't really care if anything like happens to because we are going to be like slicing our t-shirts so we're just make sure you're not doing it like on your grandma antique table and you should be okay I'm just gonna lay it out and get it going if you don't feel super creative but you still want to make your own peace dress shirt just go on Instagram or go on Google and check out like distressed tees and you can just kind of pull inspiration from there or you can just like wing it and go off of your brain which is what I'm going to try to do so hey girl and if you don't have a spray bottle what you can do is take a bottled water poke some holes on the top fill that with bleach and then just kind of sprinkle that over your shirt if you don't have anything to you know can you people want to see you but if you don't have anything don't excuse me I'm about to de-stress this tea okay okay one moment to give you to pot to lay on how about you come over here in Lee all right so I'm just going to start by cutting the tea and we're going to start like here on the neckline so what you want to do is you want to pull the fabric up and like pinch it together and then cut into it that way so we're just gonna what this is going to be a bigger hole here and then as you see you have a hole and then what you want to do is like just get your fingers in there kind of pull it apart a little more so it doesn't look so much like I've cut looks you know like a rip like it's naturally there I just want to stretch it out little holes here suade all it's hard to see but I'm just kind of creating little cuts in the collar in when you're making your holes you just want to pinch it together and cut and then stretch it don't be scared to like rip it more with your fingers the whole actual hole I'll just give it a better like overall look miss you too I just got home from LA yesterday so she's little just a little more clingy when I come home and then what I'm going to do is take the sleeve and right where the line is stitch I'm going to cut right along there to get rid of this stitching here so that the seat kind of gets a little bit of a roll up to it so just try to cut as close to the actual stitch as you can or you going to cut off more like if you just want a little bit of a shorter sleeve and then so that you don't have that rough kind of edge you just want to give the shirt a tug so that it starts to so you see like the sleeve is like rolled up now we have to give it like a raw edge I like to cut holes down here on the bottom like along the edge because member I'm going to keep my actual seam here so I like some holes to be like in the mix so just very repetitive we're just going to pinch the fabric together and then cut it cut it oh got a little wonky on us it's all right just go with that little hole there okay that's a little better okay the shirt did switch but the other camera just wasn't picking up the distressing like this one was so what I do is I open my scissors wide like this this is going to be easiest way to de-stress your shirt and then you're going to pull the fabric and then scratch along the t-shirt this is going to give you a really nice distress mark and it's going to be a lot faster than just cutting little tiny holes if you want to go through and cut little tiny holes be my guest but this is what I do throughout the entire t-shirt and then one more time just pull the fabric taut and drag the scissors along it as you can see it's super easy and it creates really nice distressed holes just be careful with these scissors to not cut yourself I did end up cutting myself a couple times but it is a lot easier than like I said going through and cutting holes so let's go ahead and switch back to our Guns and Roses tee okay so here's my Guns N'Roses team once I finish distressing it I do think the easiest way is to just drag the scissors across to create your distress marks and then add little holes in between where you drag the scissors that's the way that I think is just easiest to do it and don't be scared to distress your tee you're not going to mess it up I promise you just kind of go with the flow and I promise that it'll turn out good so let's go ahead and move on to the bleach so I buy bleach just in a spray bottle I'm going to start with this for like light things the bleach it'll start to turn immediately this is just like mere seconds of the bleach being on the shirt alright so I got the bleach and a little dropper and as you can see I've just been kind of dropping it all over the shirt wherever I feel like it needs it so it's just a combo of spray bottle and just little drops and then you just leave the bleach on until you kind of get the desired color that you want out of it so I'm gonna let this change colors a little more and see how much more bleach I need to put on this guy I'm looking pretty good I'm still just letting a little bit of the bleach turn you can do the back if you want I kind of just let it bleed through so then you'll just have kind of like these little bleach marks throughout the back of your shirt but I mean if you want to de-stress the back be mad yes all right so now what we're going to do is we're going to go wash this bad boy in cold water to stop the bleach from activating any more than it is [Music] then you just want to let this guy hang and dry overnight and when you wake up I'll have a

multivitamins i haven't had multivitamins in a while i feel like i recently mentioned come on man come on there we go haven't had multivitamins in a while i feel like i mentioned that recently in a

amazon for two so we're gonna see if they fit and see if this is what i wear from now on because i need thicker shirts i need good shirts um and these are three x's i usually wear two x's but i'm gonna see if these uh work a little bit better uh and uh yeah these work then i'm gonna be buying different colors of these and multiples of these uh because and i okay so this is the three or g thirty 3500 maybe it's the g5000 it'll be in the title but uh that's what these are so i'm going to take off this jacket right here you know what i'm saying getting all sexy you feel me you feel me this is what this is what my exoskeleton actually looks like you know what i'm saying i'm a i'm beefy i'm beefy but i got i got that muscle you feel me but i'm obese like my stomach it's it's it's fluffy right now it's very fluffy you know what i'm saying my beard still looking sexy you know what i'm saying i could do all my videos like this but i just ain't showing my nipples you feel me i'll show them a little bit you know what i'm saying just anyway ah this is a little fan it's a little oh my god this is huge this is huge oh my god this might actually work this might actually fit big time oh this is nice yup this is this is where it's at you can go hold you i don't think this could actually um ever like get too big or too small you know what i'm saying yeah this is my style this is my style for sure i like that see how everything like it it fits you know what i'm saying and even if it got tighter it'd be all good in the hood but no these are nice shirts i like this and it's not tight at all whatsoever and i feel like if i got the double x it still wouldn't be tight um i'm trying to think is there anything else to really say about this shirt i like it i'm gonna wear it for a couple days maybe come back with a like a more in-depth review of this shirt uh but for now i really like it it's definitely long enough uh this is the 3x though that's what kind of oh it's all the way zoomed out here let me get all the way back here yeah see it's all the way it's all the way past my generals which is very rare like it's like uh right here like it it's it's very long like it's it's a good long too but no this shirt is nice you know what i'm saying dang that's crazy so shout out to big john for recommending these uh very very nice shirts um so as of right now i'm going to get more but i'm going to wear for a couple days wash them see how it goes that way and if it pretty much stays the same size then i'm going to keep it and get a bunch more so uh yeah that's uh that's where i'm at right now uh with these shirts that i mean this is a very very nice shirt let's see if it's shrunk or not let's see oh yeah it shrunk it shrunk quite a bit let me go look in the mirror right quick i'm going to keep it real i don't really know how to wash shirts so that they don't shrink um i'm sorry i think it's the dryer that makes them shrink i don't think it's the washer but yeah i don't really know how to wash shirts to make them not shrink but after washing this and everything um it's about a double x so it just goes down to size if you you know wash and dry it normally the way that you would normally dry wash and dry something i'm not quite sure that this is the one that big john was recommending but i'm gonna assume that this is close to you know that as i can probably get um and yeah i think what it really boils down to is the fact that i need to lose weight that's pretty much it that's pretty much what it boils down to i need to lose weight and i'll like the way that i fit in clothes better but overall if you're wanting a bigger t-shirt a shirt that fits you more like even um no i guess it didn't really shrink that much it didn't really shrink that much the the length did um it's uh let me see yeah because it was like under under my genitals before and it's not am i wearing it the correct way yeah it's not under my genitals anymore but i'll definitely buy more of these shirts i really like them they don't shrink a tremendous amount now a couple washes down the line who knows what will happen but for right now you know it's uh it's pretty nice and i'll buy a couple more of these shirts i i do like them they're comfortable they look good and all that kind of stuff and yeah yeah i just need to lose weight and work out that's like my only issue right now um and yeah that's my only issue but anyway that's all for this video i hope you enjoy my name is king civilback if you go on amazon and you look up heavy cotton um what the title is is what i got so uh it did shrink a little bit but not that much i don't know that this is the authentic heavy cotton but this is a lot heavier than the other shirt that i got because the other shirt was really really i mean i don't know if it's down here or not but it's really really thin um and this you can't really see see through the shirt um but yeah anyway that's all off this video hope you enjoyed my name is king silverback hope you have a fantastic day i will say that i do recommend these they're decent shirts my name is king silva back i'll see you later", "z31TqO1tCFM": "hey guys it is so freaking hot like i hope you're not wearing any synthetic shirts out in this heat if you are please stop please go through your closet and see which ones are 100 cotton and which ones aren't because 100 cotton shirts are going to let the moisture from your skin breathe out into the air and take with it excess heat from your body if you don't your body has to produce more adrenaline to keep you alive because it constricts the blood vessels to maintain blood pressure because they dilate from the heat your body has to produce more adrenaline in the hot weather and that is not just a short-term thing it affects you long-term it affects muscle tension muscle pain any pain uh relaxation like lack thereof um [Music] it heightens your nervous system long term and then you also get a crash the next day if it's bad enough you get a spike of adrenaline when you're outside in the hot weather and then the next day you'll go down so anyway please we're 100 cotton closed and yes it will shrink more than synthetic but that's the price you pay to feel better so uh make sure you do have moisture on you because you know the more moisture the more there's evaporative cooling i don't really sweat a lot unfortunately i wish i did sweat more because then i would have more evaporative cooling um this is a professional not professional but it's like a mister you can get it even sally beauty supply has them um the more moisture that you have on your skin the more there is evaporative cooling the the water actually can hold on to heat from a surface and then take it away but guess what i got some t-shirts yes i did because i need them i'm a t-shirt enthusiast because i'm big on comfort and i want to protect the skin i have on my chest from the sun and just to let you know um this chest skin doesn't heal like the rest of your skin if you get a sunburn here it's gonna heal okay but if you get a sunburn here it's not gonna heal as well so protect the chest um girls tend to wear a lot of open chested shirts so you know think of the future and what your skin what you want your skin to look like um and then also uh yeah those are the two reasons that i like t-shirts and i think they look cool i mean you gotta make them look cool you know you gotta accessorize and um and i could not find my other shirt that is a cream color so i have this black one on but in the sun do not wear dark colored shirts because it will absorb all the light energy and turn it into heat and it is just like so bad so yeah i just got my t-shirts um oh my gosh i can't open this oh these are the designs i made oh my gosh oh wow i'm so excited so i'm excited to see like the colors that i chose and um like i designed these oh cool like i wanted some that were light colored you know for the sun and i like this this blue this is like this color is supposed to be sand and it's a really good brand of t-shirt raise the vibe metal detect or metal district mercantile oh this is a good shirt i really like this now i got medium i can get small or medium but um it's 100 cotton so if it gets really shrunken like really really really shrunken like if i keep it in the dryer for like two hours or something which no don't do that don't don't don't do that that that might be some kind of harm to something i don't know but um oh wow i like this i really like this one okay and then um okay huh interesting okay here's the next one choose piece i really like this color too it's called warm gray which it doesn't really look i guess it does kind of look like right but it is it's like a taupe color um i like this taupe color i think it looks very classy and it says choose piece i think that is so appropriate for right now um i wish that the white was a little more like thicker like this one is thicker so i'll have to contact the company and ask them um i don't know if all t-shirts are like i don't know if it's different on each t-shirt you know what i mean but still it's it's fine i really like it i like this color and it's still light pretty light enough for the sun you know okay and then um this one is cream color still light enough for the sun metal detecting yay um that's a such a pretty color and i think these two colors go well together like i said i chose these colors so i'm proud of myself like i thought about like which colors would go well together i like thought about everything okay so ah yeah now i can wear these cool and then the last one i got was an alien t-shirt i like aliens i'm just that way if you know what i mean um now this is a black t-shirt um i'm not gonna wear this in the sun but oh my gosh this is so cool and the the die is like really thick on there and it says and that was 20 20. oh my gosh i love this shirt the only shirt that i'm like questioning is um like like this ink is thick enough the only one that i'm questioning is this one that the ink didn't get so thick and i don't know why it's still okay but it's not as thick as the others so i'm a picky person okay i'm very critical and scrutinizing and so like my eyes just like zoom in and pick everything out but anyway oh man so anyway you can get these shirts if you like um if you have any questions about sizing or whatever please contact me bad because i don't want you to get a shirt that's too small or that whatever i want you to get a shirt that you really love and it can be like a cool shirt to wear out or like a statement shirt or just choose peace wow that is so cool anyway um let me know what you think bye-bye hey guys what do you think do you like it okay so i just wanted to give you one tip if you ever get a shirt which i'm sure you will in the future it's really really important to keep in mind the color and if it goes with your skin undertone for example i have a warm skin undertone and so if i go with warm colors like this cream or like some of these colors it just makes my face look brighter and more alive and it just it just makes my face look better if you have a cool skin undertone um it's better to go with like with cooler colors just like experiment with it and you will see so anyway um yeah i emailed the company and they said this um they said oh no we are so sorry to hear that we definitely want to do all we can to help could you go ahead and send over the photos you have of the issue for for this shirt with those picks we'll be able to work with our production team to diagnose and remedy any potential issues so i emailed them the pictures and then they said thank you for getting that over to us please keep the one you

quality means a lot to me too but so anyway if you have any comments or questions leave them in the comment section if you just want to say hey that'd be awesome and i'll talk to you later [Music] you", "XBadLUHLe6E": "hi guys it's Bob Young from heist embody and today I'll be walking you through three ways to tie-dye your t-shirt we'll be doing three different methods crumpled shibori and spiral first let's go through everything you'll need gloves to protect your hands an apron or old clothes a tarp or plastic cover fabric dye salt or soda ash dye fixative plastic squeeze bottles large Ziploc bags of container and hot water rubber bands wooden dowel and of course your white t-shirt to begin make sure your t-shirts are clean wash them even if they're new new shirts sometimes have a chemical that keeps the dye from taking properly prepare your dye instructions will vary we use the powder that you mix into hot water which we then transfer it into our plastic squeeze bottle you don't need to put your dye in to squeeze bottles but if you're gonna die a t-shirt multiple colors this is the most accurate way if you're dying with just one color you can dye the shirt in a container full of dyeing you're ready to prep and dye your shirts the first technique is called the crumpled pattern start crumpling the fabric with your fingers keep scrunching the tee until everything is in a crumpled Mound hold the shirt in place with rubber bands the tighter you make it the more patterns you'll get apply the dye using the squeezed models and don't hold back you can really soak the tee flip the shirt over and repeat on the other side if you're using multiple colors liberally apply the different dyes for more vibrant random final result once died seal your t-shirt in the ziplock bag to keep it damp as the die sets and let it sit for six to eight hours [Music] lay your t-shirt flat and set the dowel in the center where you want your spiral to be twist until the t-shirt is a spiral shape find the tee tightly with three rubber bands creating six wedge shapes [Music] apply your colors one by one to the wet shapes for the best results make opposing wedges the same color now flip the spiral fabric over and repeat on the back once died seal the t-shirt in the ziplock bag and let it sit for six to eight hours [Music] roll your t-shirt tightly around a non-absorbent tube we use the paper roll which honestly wasn't the best but it worked secure both ends with rubber bands [Music] tightly scrunch both ends of the Roll t-shirt towards the center you can also secure rubber bands along the entire tube applied to the fabric rotating the tube is necessary once died seal the t-shirt in a ziplock bag and let it sit for six to eight hours [Music] final steps once you've got your t-shirts sit for a while prepare the dye fixative by mixing it with warm water you'll want the water to be between 100 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit soak the t-shirts in the fixative the exact time they'll need to soak varies based on the type of fixative so check the packaging after soaking the t-shirts rinse them in cold water you can use some light detergent if you want finally leave the shirts to air dry one important thing wash your tie-dyed shirt on its own the first time you put it in the machine to avoid the die bleeding onto other clothes and that was our

I'm gonna flip the shirt over and I'm going to go ahead and do an extra 15 seconds so it's gonna ensure that it lasts and there you have it super cute", "xQLuPSE69Ao": "- Hey, everybody! And in this video I'm gonna be revealing five mystery T-shirt designs\nthat made over $100,000 on Teespring or the very\nsimilar website, ViralStyle. Not only am I going to reveal\nwhat these T-shirts are, but I'm also going to\nexplain why they sold so well so that you can help take these lessons and create your own successful designs. Now, my last video on\nTeespring turned out to be pretty popular, so I suspect a lot of you know what Teespring is, but\njust in case that you don't, Teespring is a website\nwhere you can sell custom, print-on-demand merch that you create, with the most popular being T-shirts. Once you sign up, which is free to do, you can then create\nyour own custom products by uploading an image file. You then in add in a product description and set a price. It's like having your\nown website where people can purchase your shirt from you, but of course, you don't\nhave to pay anything to list and sell it. Then, when a customer comes to your page and purchases the T-shirt\nfrom you, Teespring will then print your image onto a T-shirt and then ship it out to\nthe customer for you. Best of all, they will\ndo this automatically without you having to do anything. In the industry, we call\nthis print-on-demand. Now, for many people that's not actually the best part about Teespring. The best part for some\npeople is that to sell an item on there and\nto make money doing so, you don't actually need\nto have a credit card or any start-up money. That's because when you\nsell a T-shirt on Teespring, what they'll do, is take\nthe money that the customer pays, remove the cost of\nthe T-shirt from the price and pay out the difference\nas profit, like a commission. They have multiple payout options. You can have it paid out\nto your PayPal account or a worldwide Payoneer account. So obviously, all of this is pretty cool. It allows you to sell\nproducts and make money without having to spend any money. But, it does beg a couple of questions. Question one, what T-shirts should I sell? And question two, how should I sell them? And I think those are great questions, so in this video we're gonna be looking at previous case studies and examples of successful T-shirts that sold hundreds of thousands of dollars on Teespring. But that's not all, because\nwe've had a huge influx of new subscribers, I decided to introduce some to a staple here at this\nchannel, which is quiz videos. What I'm gonna do, is I'm\ngonna reveal one T-shirt to you you have five seconds\nto guess how much money you think that this T-shirt made. Play along and see how\nmany you can get right. All right, here is mystery\nT-shirt number one. How much money do you think\nthat this made on Teespring? You have five seconds to guess, go! (cowbell timer tings) (high-pitched bell dings) All right, drum roll please!\n(drum roll drumbeat) The answer is that this\nT-shirt made over $200,000. Yep, this T-shirt design\nhas made it's creator over $200,000 on Teespring, which is pretty incredible. But how did he do it? Well, he followed that exact same method that I talked about in last week's video. He used the Facebook Fan\nPage plus Teespring method. Best of all, this T-shirt\nhere, it's just one example of a successful design that\nhis Teespring store has had. It's made hundreds of\nthousands of dollars by selling a big range of engineer\nrelated merchandise, thanks to this Facebook Fan Page. So here it is. Now, yes it's pretty big at this point, but even when it was just\na fraction of it's size, it was making money and in fact, it's been making money consistently\nfor years and years. It's built it's following in a simple way, by posting funny pictures that\nare relevant to engineers. Funny pictures and pages\nare one of the easiest ways to grow, because people will often share the posts with their\nfriends and best of all, tag them in posts. Now, over time this page has\ngrown organically for free as a result of consistently\nposting funny pictures that engineers like. Now, he usually posts\nabout two pictures a day and this keeps your audience engaged and as you can see, he also advertises the products in the post\nand because of the fact the pairs it with a funny\npicture, it gets huge engagement and advertising for their products. Now of course, building\nup a niche social media account like this is not\nan overnight strategy, but that's okay because\nit is a free strategy. As I said before on this\nchannel, if you want overnight, fast, free\nmoney then you need to be prepared to pay for traffic\nand I will be showing you an example of a fast money\nmethod later in this video. But if you want a free\nstrategy to make money, then this is a great one. Build up a social media\nfollowing that focuses on a group of people that are highly passionate about something. In this case, engineers are very dedicated to their professional careers\nand are extremely passionate. And then, once you have built\na social media following, you can then use it to\nlaunch and sell products designed to appeal to\nit over and over again. Honestly, this is pretty basic. It's not rocket science to\nsee why this works so well. But, even though there are\nliterally countless examples of people who are doing this successfully, I still had people asking\non my previous Teespring video, \"Hey guys, does\nthis actually work?\" And whenever I saw a comment like that, I'm not a good person because\nwhat I was thinking was, gee, let me think about that for a moment. Does building a niche\naudience online of people who are passionate about\nsomething by posting great content that they\nlike and then using that platform to share\nproducts that appeal to this audience, does this work? Because even though\nthere are lots and lots of examples of people who are successfully doing this, I'm still not actually sure. If this whole, take time\nto build a dedicated social page about a niche\naudience and then post great niche-specific\nshareable products on there that the would actually like. I'm not sure if this actually works. (deeply inhales) Well, if you're still\non the fence about this, then take this video as your answer. Yes, if you're dedicated\nto this and don't treat it like an overnight gold rush, this does very much indeed work. If you're looking to follow\nthis strategy for yourself, but you're not sure what\nniche audience you should build up on say, Instagram\nor Facebook or another social media page, then\ncareers can actually be a great source of inspiration. For example, here's one of\nmy favorite Instagram pages, which yes, also works\ngreat with this method instead of a Facebook Fan Page. This page is all about accounting memes. You know, I'm not even an\naccountant, but I have friends that are and they love this page. And as you can see on Social Blade, they are growing rapidly\neach and every day. They plan to launch merchandise soon and if they do what the\nengineering memes page did and create a great design,\nthey will be successful. And here is another example\nof a career-focused design. This nursing T-shirt was\naimed at a very specific type of nurse, an OB nurse\nand it made well over 50 thousand dollars. And this T-shirt here for math teachers, well, this one made over\n50 thousand dollars too. And by the way, if you are\nenjoying this video so far and you have learned\nsomething and you would like to learn even more about\nmaking money online, then be sure to subscribe and click that little notification bell\n(bell dings) next to it so that you\ndon't miss out on any of our videos. Did you guess right? If so, congratulations. If you didn't though,\nthat's okay because we've got another chance for you to win. It's on to mystery T-shirt number two. All right, here is the T-shirt. How much money do you think\nthat this design has made? You've got five seconds, go! (cowbell timer tinging) (high-pitched bell dings) All right, time's up! Drum roll please!\n(drum roll drumbeat) This T-shirt made over $400,000. And it's such a simple design! It's mostly just text\nwith a simple graphic of a football that you could easily find available for free! So why did such a simple\ndesign that anyone could so easily replicate sell so well? Well, this T-shirt is actually in a niche where simple text-based\ndesigns with great slogans that appeal emotionally to the customer actually sell well and\nthat's because the number one thing in life that parents\nare passionate about is their kids. So it shouldn't come as a surprise then, that this similar T-shirt\nthey created aimed at mothers of kids that play baseball\nmade well over $100,000. And this design for\nmothers of soccer players made over $50,000. And fun fact, unlike\nmost places in the world, here in New Zealand, we actually use the same terminology as the USA. We call this soccer and\nwe call this football and of course, we call this rugby. RIP the All Blacks. Anyway, back to the video. Did you guess right? If so, congratulations! If you didn't, it's all\ngood because we've got another chance for you to win. All righty, here's mystery\nT-shirt number three. How much money do you\nthink that this one made on a Teespring clone\nlike website, ViralStyle? You've got five seconds to guess, go! (cowbell timer tings) (high-pitched bell dings) Okay then, drum roll please!\n(drum roll drumbeats) The answer is that this\nT-shirt made over $200,000. The question then is why? Well, there are two\nmajor factors as to why this T-shirt and it's product variations sold so well. But first, we wanna go and take a look at where this Teespring store\nmanaged to find it's customers and surprise, surprise. It's customers came from Facebook. Here is this store fan page. They have tens of\nthousands of fans of people in the hunting niche. Now, this ad promoting this\nT-shirt did incredibly well and it's not hard to see why. From the comments you very\nquickly get the impression that people are taken aback\nand pleasantly surprised by the shirt because\nthey've never seen anything like it before. Yet it speaks so strongly to them, because the time that\nthese fathers and daughters spend together is some of\ntheir happiest memories. At the time that this T-shirt launched, very few T-shirts out there existed that targeted this very large,\npassionate group of people. Targeting an underserved niche of people is one of the secrets\nof creating successful print-on-demand products. It's why that this T-shirt,\ndespite statistically being more relevant to a bigger audience, did not sell quite as\nwell as this T-shirt here because the previous\nT-shirt targeted a group of people that already\nhad products for it. By focusing on daughters that go hunting with their dads, despite it\nbeing a smaller group of people, it did well because\nproducts in this sub-niche did not previously exist. Although, yes this T-shirt\ndefinitely sold well too, even if it wasn't quite\nas big of a winner. But this fan page is also\nnoteworthy for something else. It's noteworthy for the\nway in which they rapidly grew their fan page and\nthe way that they rapidly grew their sales. What they did, was they\ncreated this amazing design to kick-start it that\nresonated with people and then advertised it\nwith low-cost Facebook ads. Because people really liked\nthe design and shared it with their friends, not only\ndid people go and buy it, but the page got thousands of likes too. They got paid while growing their Facebook Fan Page with ads. The fan page that they then\nused to launch new designs for the future. Pretty cool, right? There's another bonus feature\nto this T-shirt though, that helped them sell a lot of shirts and it's because when\nmost people buy this, they don't just buy one, they buy two. One T-shirt for the dad and one T-shirt for the daughter. Being creative and creating\nproducts that are designed to have somebody buy not\njust one, but multiples of it is one of the easiest ways\nto drastically increase the profits you make when selling online, which is why I teach you how to implement this tactic effectively inside my premium print-on-demand video training\ncourse, The ECOMM Clubhouse. If you're interested in\nsigning up, you'll find a link to it in the\nvideo description below. And you know what, there's\nactually something else that eagle eye subscribers\nwho were watching closely earlier might have noticed. These two successful\nT-shirts, they're essentially just the same design. Once this one design was\nmade, all the creator had to do was swap out\nthe word daughter for son. It's two winning designs\nfor the price of one. So, did you get it right? If so, congratulations. If you didn't though, that's\nokay because we've got another chance for you to win. Here is mystery T-shirt number four. How much money do you\nthink that this made? You have five seconds to guess, go! (cowbell timer tings) (high-pitched bell dings) All right, time's up! Drum roll please!\n(drum roll drumbeat) This T-shirt made over $300,000. Yep, over $300,000. Isn't that crazy? Well, it's not actually that crazy at all. Because believe it or not,\nthis whole little niche of making T-shirts designed\naround people's ages, is actually extremely popular\nand very high in demand. This Teespring store, it\nhasn't just made $300,000 from this T-shirt, nope! It's made over $150,000 with this design and over $40,000 with this design and over $35,000 from this design. If you haven't guessed\nalready why these T-shirts sold so well, a really big part of it is that they kinda fall\nunder the birthday niche. I.e. someone might buy\nthis T-shirt for a friend who is turning 50 or some\npeople might just buy it for themselves as a\nfunny surprise for their friends and family on their birthday. Now, this isn't the\nonly reason why somebody would buy an age-based T-shirt, but it is a really big reason. And actually, while this\nvideo is about Teespring, it is worth deviating for a moment to talk about another website\nwhere this niche dominates and that is Merch by Amazon. This is Amazon's free\nprint-on-demand service. For those of you that\ndon't know, Merch by Amazon works incredibly similar to\nthe way that Teespring does. Once registered, you can\ncreate your own custom products like T-shirts. All you need to do is\nupload the artwork or design you want onto it. You can then go in and select which colors you want your T-shirt to be\nand create a custom product page for it. Your T-shirt product page\nlisting will then go live and people can buy it and find\nit directly on Amazon.com, Amazon UK, and Amazon Germany. Just like this T-shirt here, which is also in the birthday niche. In the last month, it made\nit's creator over $3,000. It's a nice source of side\nincome for it's creator. Just like Teespring, Amazon\nwill collect the money that the customer paid, take\nout the cost of production and then pay out the rest to you as profit in the form of a commission. However, unlike with\nTeespring, where almost anyone can sign up for an account,\nwith Merch by Amazon, you do need to submit an application. So I highly recommend\nthat you go and you Google for advice on how to successfully submit an application letter so that you can get accepted first go like several\nof our subscribers were when they applied after\nwatching my last video. But yes, Amazon is actually\na really common place for people to come and search for T-shirts to buy for birthdays,\nespecially milestone birthdays. Such as this simple text-based\nT-shirt design here, which made over $1,400\npassively last month. And this T-shirt here,\nwhich made almost $5,000 last month passively from free internal search traffic. And another way to\nsuccessfully twist this idea of making a T-shirt about birthdays is to instead of focusing on the\nage, focus on the birth year. Such as this shirt here. While it's aimed at 50 year olds, it focuses on the birthday\nyear, rather than the age. In the last month, this\nhas made over $3,000 and has consistently\nbeen making it's creator thousands of dollars each and every month from free internal search traffic. Did you get it right? If so congratulations. If you didn't, that's all\ngood because you've got another chance to win. It's on to mystery T-shirt number five. Here it is! How much money do you think\nthat this made on Teespring? You have five seconds to guess, go! (cowbell timer tings) (high-pitched bell dings) All right, time's up! Drum roll please!\n(drum roll drumbeat) The answer is that this\nT-shirt made over $100,000. Pretty insane, right? Just the word pretentious\ninside of a red rectangle. And creating this on image editing app would be super simple! Making money online is so easy! I'm gonna go ahead and do this right now. But no, sorry son. It's not quite that simple. The reason why this\ndesign sold over $100,000 is because it was sold by none other than Philip DeFranco, who if\nyou've never heard of him before, runs a news and\ncommentary YouTube channel with over six million subscribers. So, remember, if you are\nusing a product research tool like this to look at\npreviously successful products in places like Teespring\nor AliExpress, be careful. Just because you see a product sold well, doesn't mean that it's\ngood for you to sell because the context of\nwhy a product or a design sold well is extremely important too. So yes, product research apps can be great for print-on-demand stores\nand drop-shipping stores, but don't rely on them. Thanks for watching this video. How many T-shirts did you guess right?

believe that's what in scarcity when it comes to like choosing t-shirt you want a good balance of quality because just the amount of money you put in for me Uniqlo supima cotton t-shirt sits on that sweet spot the t-shirt isn't too expensive and it's made up of supima cotton so a little background if you guys are not familiar with supima cotton it's basically like to the best of my knowledge superior from mixup on 1% of Earth's cotton resources if you dive deeper the reason why supima cotton is such a great company is because the nature of its cotton it's able to retain the color dye as well as offer a smoother texture compared to other type I'm not really like a huge fan of my printed t-shirt having a printed t-shirt means you're putting a crime stamp onto this t-shirt once this print it's out of fashion your t-shirt is about window and me it's not really an idea that subscribe because I think to some extent we can all contribute and do our part to maintain the longevity of the clothes that we have to do our parts for the environment moving on let's talk about colors some of the basic colors that I stick to I like black gray white maybe and allowing a random color that suits my mood so in this case this season it's like this sort of dark green color I thought it'd give up their military vibe it's something I'm trying out this time this t-shirts are like stable so you can get them all year round as long as there's a Uniqlo store near you what are some of the basic color you guys have let me know in the comment section down below and I'll see you in the next

see you in the next video bye guys have a great day [Music]", "j3BvRCNoHG4": "[Music] hey guys this jason with DTG mart and in this video we're gonna go over why it's beneficial to print on ring-spun cotton over a regular cotton when using a DTD printer for this test we'll be using a guild an ultra cotton tee for one print and a ring spun tongs blank tee for the second print [Music] the processes for creating regular cotton in a ring-spun cotton are totally different regular cotton is made from soft vegetable fibers that are twisted together to make yarn which is then woven to make the material regular cotton is less expensive to make which means it's a big seller ring-spun cotton is the more expensive counterpart ring-spun cotton is spun in a way that produces stronger longer strands that are soft extremely durable and free from the rough texture of standard raw cotton the process of continually spinning twisting and thinning the cotton strands is what yields long soft strands because ring-spun cotton uses thinner and more tightly knitted strands of cotton this provides a much more flat and even surface for you to print on now let's take a look at the difference between the both prints the image on the ring spun cotton provides a smoother looking texture to the print while also keeping the colors more vibrant is the white underbase is able to provide a flatter surface for the color to lay on [Music] as always thanks for watching make sure you subscribe to the channel and if you have any suggestions for future videos make sure you leave them in the

product review for the trusted Gildan guild ang mm altar a cotton t-shirt 100% cotton this is a great product and the reason why I wanted to choose this product for today's review is because he's holed up so well we've been printing t-shirts for over 20 years believe it or not and some of the very first t-shirts that we ever printed were in fact printed on the the guild an ultra cotton and be still be still hold up we still have we still have we still have teachers from 20 years ago and that's why this is a great value based product now it's not the softest of hand you know it is 100% cotton so it is a little bit coarse it doesn't have what it doesn't have a lot of a lot of other features like the dry like the dry fit or if you want moisture wicking it does absorb it does absorb sweat very well however so a lot of people in the kitchen industry tend to prefer the hundred percent cotton what else is nice about this they come in an awful lot of colors there's a very wide color selection they come in a large variety of sizes up to 5 6 X and a lot of different different colors that aren't available from most companies but the biggest reason why I like this product is that it holds up again so I got so this is a brand-new this is a brand-new t-shirt right here brand new Gildan 2000 shirt and this is one that I've had for at least two maybe three years and I have I have worn the heck out of this I have intentionally tried but you can't even see the you can't even see the label anymore here honest to goodness I have washed this just so many times worn this out in the desert wanted out camping let the dogs sleep on it and they still hold up I mean there is just you know look at this I mean you know four to three year old t-shirt you know the the stitching is still all intact the hems are pretty good here look around the neckline there's a little bit of a little of wear and tear but not too terribly much stretching here this is still a nice t-shirt in fact I'm gonna put this on when I'm done with a review and go do some yard work in it and and people love it they always can still see the design look at how nice that shows up this is this is the black one this is your we didn't print this design all this is just a sample shirt so I took it out and researched and developed it and you can see kind of how well this wood held up well this dark dark Heather anyways it's a nice really nice shirt here the last thing we'll enjoy your attention to is the discharge water-based screen printing that we did on the Gildan t-shirt and this is why I specifically chose this shirt for it is because it holds up so well because again this is a brand new one the only drawback what you have and use white ink is that there is titanium in it which will cause some cracking as you see here very minimal but it is gonna crack eventually versus the discharge ink which will never crack at all so either way you can find all of these designs on our HMS nation website or contact heart mind soul for a custom quote today", "3UmS2zWXrLc": "hey guys this team of style I'm Jose Zuniga and for this week's video we're going to be talking all about t-shirts so like you guys have been pointing out in the comment section I've been wearing a lot of t-shirts lately and that's for a specific reason I've been test driving a lot of brands lately trying to find the perfect t-shirt for you guys then for myself as well now I already know where you're going to say but Jose you told us not to wear t-shirts like three years ago and you're right however my feelings towards t-shirts have drastically changed I feel that a good t-shirt that fits really well can be a suitable casual option for men especially in hot humid summer heat one of the biggest reasons why I didn't like t-shirts was the fact that they shrunk so easily here's a prime example this is an H&M t-shirt that I bought literally less than six months ago honestly after three washes the t-shirt was already two sizes too small and this is what I did it light I have a drawer full of about five to ten hmmm t-shirts that I just don't use because they're two sizes too small and why I love their six dollar price point I don't love that I have to be buying new ones every four wears or whatever it may be so the reason why you've been seeing t-shirts so much lately is because I've been test driving t-shirts trying to find the perfect t-shirt under two categories one quality I wanted a t-shirt that's so well-made that it's not going to shrink after one or two washes but instead fit great always and then the second one was that fit a t-shirt that actually fit well and stayed with that proper fit for multiple wear so I wasn't looking for disposability I was looking for quality t-shirts that look good and feel good and I've never in my search to three brand recommendations for you guys and some of the best t-shirts out there for men and there are multiple price points and I did that purposely my three recommendations are going to be Tanny trim menswear and black socks also in that order of price point so let's start with tani tani is going to be my high-end recommendation of the three I'm going to be talking about the reason why tani is that the high-end one is because their t-shirts can retail anything from 65 to 145 yes I said $145 for a single t-shirt so this is definitely for the guy that's comfortable paying that amount and why it is the high-end option you also must understand those that you're getting the best of the best there is when you invest into tanning the owner was nice enough to send over a discount Konan if you use TMF 25 you'll get 25% off your order which is a hefty discount considering the price point of these t-shirts the t-shirts you're seeing right now are they're lower priced t-shirts at $65 the great thing about tanning t-shirts is that they feature a moisture wicking fabric called micro motor air fabric all their shirts are made in Europe with natural materials the fabric itself is super lining cool it's actually softer and thinner than silk giving the user a remarkably comfortable and soft feel these two models you're seeing have been washed twice already and as you can see their Fit is still excellent and I really didn't experience any shrinkage with these two t-shirts most in part because these t-shirts features 6% elastane and their shirts that really helps for the shirt to return back to its original shape and that shrink or stretch out which are two things you don't want in a t-shirt next up we have trim menswear trim menswear as a handcrafted brand that's tratar 'get it for the athletic man so if you have an athletic build this brand might suit you best it's also it also Falls second on my list because it's it falls right in the middle price point wise at around $45 at t-shirt given that I usually recommend this shirt more to the Henri crowds a high earner not rich yet and of course we snag the discount code for this brand as well and if you use TMF trim 20 you'll get 20% off what I love about these t-shirts is their design and fit for around $45 you're getting a luxurious model supima cotton fabric that is natural and breathable the deep crewneck design is a refreshing twist from the various deep v-necks I already own as for the fit the t-shirt fits perfectly in all the right places I mean look at it it has a nice and snug fit around the chest and region area however it doesn't pull or constrict that it looks like I'm wearing a t-shirt that's a size too small it also has a relaxed fit through the midsection so this really adds to the breathability and the coolness of the t-shirt which makes it perfect for summer I washed both of these t-shirts you saw the both the black and the white one before this video and as you can see they're fit and quality is still on point which is the reason why they made the cut for this video and finally we have black socks black socks for Falls last on our list because it is the lowest priced model of those three we're going to be talking about this is for the guy that still wants that quality t-shirt but doesn't want to break the bank especially on a college budget black socks produces two shirts I really like their deep V Claudette model which retails around 125 dollars and their regular v-neck Suzette model which retails for around $23 and of course the good news is since you're a viewer you can use code TMF ten off and you'll get 10% off oh and then I mentioned they also have free worldwide shipping so it's really a great price point and great value the great thing with black socks is that the t-shirts even at this unbelievable low price point you're getting amazing high quality pima cotton that is naturally breathable in a fit that is perfection what I really like about the shirt though is that it also has that 5% elastane and I usually like this in shirts for two reasons it really helps make the shirt more resilient so this helps it keep its original shape even after several wear so it doesn't matter how many times you wash it the shirt always bounces back to its original shape I also like it because it hugs the arm area a little bit closer this helps gives the illusion I'm having fuller arms than you really do which almost all of us need a little help in that area when we can get it so that's it for this week's video guys I hope you enjoyed it I'll have the link down below all the t-shirts I spoke about in the order that I did with their corresponding discount code if you're interested in any of the t-shirts I spoke about so I hope you enjoyed this video if you did remember to hit up the like up I'm also let me know what you think down below which tee shirt was your favorite that's it for me for this week's video guys see you guys next time", "zyGQ8mpTXlM": "hey guys okay so I'm back in the back of the shop and I've got the heat fresh heated up and we're ready to print so forth the sublimation transfers of sublimation final as I should call it the sublimation file this one you need to pre-heat your press to three-fifty and my purse my camp is a little high I met 369 one state between and I know that sounds long but it's not so we're going to do 350 for 60 seconds when you print your final sublimation transfers your promo vinyl it's going to look like this okay so it's gonna give a dull look but once you press it this is what it's going to look like now this one is faster so once you press it gonna line up and these are the colors that you're done please so you see it's a big big difference okay and here's one that we actually be it on a t-shirt so we're going to go ahead and we're going to get started with this particular type of printable vinyl you do it comes with a clear backing and you see those sublimation inks they go all the way to the back so you do have to take this apart and remove it now because this is a pretty easy design it's all in one piece I can just remove it with my hands if maybe I was doing another video where I'm doing some tag sorts of things that are separated and I'll show you how to print how to pull those up early in the morning my mouth is very dry so that's just how you do it and you're gonna lay it face down and you always want to have some type of paper and you can use just regular regular old coffee paper this is my subs I'm sorry my screen credit transfer but I'm going to use this today while I'm waiting on my feet French to PETA is I just take my t-shirt and I fooled my t-shirt in half like this and I lay it on the fridge and I'm gonna move this camera over here some so I lay it on the crest I can lay multiple [Music] we are pressing under the stairs so all I'm doing is I'm giving a 17 and I can do five or six of these at one time if I need to [Music] so this give me a knife I already know whatever Spencer thirty and I know exactly what I'm told so that's fine everybody so I'm just going to take my transfer and because I've gotten to a point here I'm gonna [Music] without one and can't touch them done so you can't really go from scene from well I'll just pull that turnout sorry folks I'm gonna pop that down now because I'm doing sublimation vinyl transfers i'm not going to pre-press and I just had quit Princeton anyway so close this down and count off about 30 seconds go right to that [Music] and I'm going to lift my transfer straight up I don't want to leave it there and move it around okay because they'll get the wrong thing on it so I've got one down [Music] [Music] and normally don't use a ruler but [Music] now sublimation transfer they start to roll I'm gonna put something over that collar right there because it looks like a scientist I don't want that so just gonna do another one [Music] now let's remember that I am paying myself for the time that I print so always remember to calculate in your crisis the time that it takes you to print those garments [Music] good thing I didn't put that there [Music] [Music] the colors of nice and vibrant I'm continued with these [Music] [Music] but I'm always using just a regular heat transfer paper uses a regular not heat transfer for regular copy paper you'll save a lot my heat breath was not flattering [Music] probably [Music] [Music] I noticed that I've got just a little bit of that white outline showing someone go back over this with my favorite friend and that's the ability continue to go on - sure you [Music] it's a good idea to invest in a lint roller and lint roll that area I don't have a lot of [Music] so I'm just going to continue to do this and show you guys the picture to kind of give you guys an idea as you get to get to going on this fresh thing you know once I pretty much know where the print goes and I don't really use the metric package well one thing you have to realize is you see how that curling up is that when you're pressing you gotta watch out for that that makes sure that you don't get curls now I'm going to reuse this paper but the reason that I'm reusing if I am doing a black shirt I've gotta make sure that it doesn't you are my sublimation I've got to make sure that my paper does so that's one of the things that you need to watch out for when you're pressing shirt another thing is if you start to get press lines on your on your charts these are polyester shirts if you start to get press lines then you want to rip your paper that's on top of it so like for example here I don't know if you can see but there is a little press line pretty much come out [Music] a really high temperature but if you were hundreds of we'll do those press live let me get a fresh taste of fresh so they're going to do is just rip the edges of it and should they ever do that in the smooth the edges I exam you will avoid those principles so this is the last shirt I'm going to a manual inspection of each and every last one of these shirts now and since idea to this cut by hand I'm going to go in with a fabric marker and make sure that I don't have any white spots it's all about so just when it's hot put this on my pray grab a marker I just gotta [Music] [Music] fabric [Music] that [Music] like [Music] so [Music] here we have it in Canton and scale [Music] and I'm doing this very I'm just looking for I want my [Music] it's about right about 9 o'clock

t-shirts now they're not ordinary men's t-shirts because on the package it says they were sent to me by Queen Esther herself it says Queen Esther company at 8900 Avenue in Spring Valley New York 10 977 ok so these were sent to me by Queen Esther of all things I mean that's just amazing right there okay so anyways um this advanced t-shirts crew neck tee short sleeve combed company now these come in all different colors you can check out the link in the description video click on the amazon thing they come in all that because I ordered to two black t-shirts now I've already opened this because I didn't know what it was when I got it I was kind of curious about Queen Esther and what she sent me so anyway there's only one black t-shirt in here but that's forgivable because this is justin's epic amazing reviews okay and people send me stuff all the time I review it if there's a mix-up and they sent me one is still got one it's okay right I can review the one t-shirt I can tell you the quality of an all that it was a mixup okay it is I I'm grateful for what I get okay as long as it works and it's good and I can review it if it's reviewable I mean sometimes I get products that are so terrible that I don't even do a review on a more review video because I'm just like hey you know sometimes sometimes if you can't say anything good at all don't say anything but but you know are the ones where I'm required to do a review and it's terrible um I usually do a review anyways if the company doesn't send me replacement which sometimes they do these people I haven't given them a lot of time to get back to me I told them there was only one in here and I said I can do the review anyway and I've had on a schedule here and I got all these these items and list so that's why I'm doing this okay nothing against Queen Esther and her amazing shirts because I'm sure they are amazing okay so here we go we're going to find out right now we got us a invoice in here and let's see what the invoice says he says to back right here to pack black extra large and this was supposed to cost sixteen dollars and ninety-nine cents and with the promotion sixteen dollars needed two cents and all this and then there was some shipping that they were going to that might include the shipping I don't know and they end up having to pay me back for the shipping on the item but anyway because I end up having to pay even though the amazon prime and paint shipping so they end up just pay me back for the shipping anyway so here it is and we're gonna we're going to try it on because it's awesome just as awesome epic amazing reviews right and so it's a friend just so awesome and so handsome and so rugged i am going to model this shirt for you okay now first of all it's very soft does it say you what it's made of i don't think so let's open it up and look at the tag let's look at the tag on this beast okay we're going to have to take a picture of this is made in pakistan so it came from New York but it was made in pakistan by Queen Esther of all things so that's kind of interesting their Queen Esther lives in in Pakistan evidently it makes these shirts or has her people do it why should dry with light colors wash as a sin as synthetic so it's a synthetic material hundred percent cotton ah what the world bombing me ah some other I don't know if that's another language or what it is I don't know okay so we're going to take pictures here because that's what we do on Justin's epic reviews we take epic pictures of products that's what they have us do okay so here we go we're going to take a picture there we go that's pretty epic in its extra large right there we're going to take another one just because just because it's so epic and there's their logo whatever it is it looks like some sort of a bowl or something I don't know hopefully it's not like a pig and statue or something and this is night k ni ght so you're going to be one Aquinas's nights when you're wearing this okay because this is nice you're a night okay so we're going to put this on and we're to try it out now I mean I probably should get a wider picture somebody's going to want me to so that's what I'm going to do and so let's take this this coat off here okay and we're going to we're going to put on the shirt it's pretty cold in here that's why I'm not going to take off the blue shirt and hopefully this one will overlap and there won't be any wrinkles or anything but anyway so yeah I'm going to punch cuz I'm a big and im Welling a trough and I'm going to put this shirt on it we're going to we're going to be awesome right okay so you know I'm not sure that I've ever modeled before in a male model for for t-shirts not on not on Justin's epic reviews so should I be nervous should I have stage fright should I be like I i hope that this this t-shirt doesn't make me look too fat I hope it doesn't make make my butt look big let's see here I guess someone in like a big butt so you know i don't know i don't i like them tight so I just don't but anyway oh there we go see that's that's it right there this I'm gonna model of shirt I would just be like oh right like that ok now let's get on this be serious here okay it feels pretty good doesn't feel comfortable and for some reason when it comes to cotton stocking caps I'm allergic to them I haven't any issues with the t-shirts though not get any way usually have to wash them first or something i'm pulling this out because it seems like it's a little longer than the black t-shirt business and that's okay that's okay it's all good don't you know oh good rock he in his house Jesus bless you okay so there we go mmm we're in black and now how does a male model like model one of these shirts I don't know because I haven't really seen it on TV so i guess i'd be like mmm hahahaha I am Justin this is just as epic reviews I'm modeling this t-shirt this night t-shirt from Queen Esther in Pakistan what do you think mailed from New York City it feels great it fits great all right pumps right but because under percent cotton I believe it can shrink unless it's been pre shrinked so you gotta wash it on cold which is what I do anyway with all my clothes Washington cold water so anyways thanks for watching the video like comment share and subscribe okay you better you better do it now okay and you better click those links in the description of the video too ok and G and may Jesus bless you", "GxZVoImp03M": "[Music] hey everybody and welcome back to the embroidery news network my name is sue and I am from oml embroidery and today we're gonna be stitching on an old t-shirt so what I'm doing here the first part of placement now we are placing this design on the back of the shirt so you want to get the middle of the shirt and usually with new shirts you can just hand press it down and get a nice line but as you can see here it's pretty hard to do I'm gonna try it anyways just to show you guys print out your template now if you're using PE design 10 you can also print out your snowman sticker it's not a sticker but it'll show you exactly where to place it general rule of thumb and the person tried on this shirt it's three fingers down from the collar so on the back or the front depending on what you're doing so I'm trying hard to place this and I'm really having a hard time and there's really no point in doing it if you can't have it straight and have it perfect so yeah I fiddle around a little bit I mean hooping is if you can't hoop something or if you don't hoop it properly the embroidery is gonna end up looking crappy so I placed it down and I thought hmmm that's okay but it's it looks a little off to me so I grabbed a ruler feel free to do that and I realized it was about an inch off on one side so scrap that that's not gonna work I don't iron so and I and I think when you use the seam at much steam it might stretch it out a bit so I double-check everything and I'm like now so here's a little trick to doing it take off your sticker because it doesn't matter anymore turn your shirt inside out grab some cut away so cuz you won't cut away on a t-shirt you have to base it down a little bit of spray and press it down give it a good press so it stays carefully turn the shirt the correct way now fold it in half now take your time because you want this line to be straight and you can finger press it and the cutaway stabilizer underneath look at my sharp line how cool is that that is how you do it the better way so I fold my template so it's easy to line up the Snowman sticker I had to straighten it up just a little bit and voila how fantastic is that I measure it just to make sure cuz I'm really picky loosen up your hoop I'm using the 8 by 8 hoop for ragnar which is my brother 1000e and make sure it's straight in and I press down and the hoop was too tight so you wanna loosen it off so you don't have to use too much force now with the Snowman make sure that it fits properly in the hoop you don't have to do it straight or anything but you do have to make sure that it fits in take it to the Machine pop it on make sure take a few minutes and make sure that nothing is gonna get caught up I double-check everything now tell your machine if you have a brother I think it's an X you have the Snowman stickers tell your machine where to find it it's scanning it right now and it's gonna straighten up the design because I didn't hoop it straight and it finds it no problem make sure you have enough lighting and once you do that it tells you to take the sticker off now do this really carefully I look like I'm being careful but I kind of got under there and I made a little wrinkle and I didn't like that because I'm again really picky so I just smoothed it out remember we have a little bit of spray on it so I just smoothed it out and it's not gonna be any problem so let's get stitching [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now how awesome is that look there's no puckers it's an old crappy t-shirt and I did some beautiful embroidery there's no problems with it it's it's not puckering it's not bubbly it's not anything that's how you want your embroidery to look so remember hoop carefully and get your designs to look exactly like this on t-shirt so thanks everyone for watching I hope you guys like this video I hope you guys will stitch out one of these designs on a t-shirt and try it and I'll see you guys in the next video you", "YTrDucbyRtU": "[Music] hi I'm David gross with conde systems back with you to share a little bit of my wisdom for sublimation success well one of the questions I have been asked for for many years going back to when I started doing civil nation was in 1992 asked can you sublimate two things that are not white well when I first started selling Maine that was the rule you you the thing needed to be white whatever you sublimate it to where there was a tile piece of metal needed to be white and so when the subject of sublimating two colors came up i said well that didn't sound like a good idea because we didn't have perfect color reproduction on a non-white substrate okay and of course you know so nation doesn't have white ink so we start with the sub sublimation process starting with white and we can go all the way to the black if we're sort of already yellow we have a limited color spectrum and so all this kept kept me saying the same thing that I just didn't think it was such a good idea to sublimate to something that wasn't white well long cane vapor and of course experience and people calling me and telling me the great success they had with sublimating to things that are not not white like fabrics for instance and and of course many years ago I had to sort of change my tune and I have been startled by the success of things that are not white like fabrics and so our friends at vapor okay have a very large product line much of which is not white and so what I wanted to do was spend a few minutes with you talking about sort of the the the the results of sublimating to these color fabrics now when we when we sublimate we essentially so make two kinds of things we so made a graphic or a photograph graphic is like the color of a fawn or something like that and so I've right before us here I've so made it on four different color shirts to give you sort of a feel for the results and and I'm telling you the results are quite impressive and I think this is this is something that you should show your clients because it's a whole lot better in many cases then the the standard just white the the Henry Ford one size fits all I've got every color you want as long as it's black and so on this first shirt here this is sort of the we'll call it the perfect shirt we've got our photograph and at the bottom of it we've sublimated the what I call the default RGB chart which we can furnish you so you can do the same thing and on each of these shirts we've we've done the same thing so you can see the effect of the underlying color on selim ation now it's a good idea if you're going to go offer this to your clients that you sublimate a color chart to each of the color shirts so you know what the color is going to be when you soul mate to it and this allows your client for instance if you wish you can show them the shirt and you can pick out they can pick out the color they want okay so so that they'll know what the results are and over the years I've seen a lot of shirts and I'm going to show you one shirt right here that that I'm startled by the results on this shirt which is one of the performance vapor shirts I believe it has a picture of a boy on it on a surfboard and even though you know sort of in theory we shouldn't be able to have reasonably good flesh tones on this shirt lo and behold not only we do we have an awesome looking sort of a neon blue here but we have some great looking flesh tones and it's just it's just very impressive almost like you know UFOs and aliens how in the world did it turn out so good but nonetheless the colors on this shirt look spectacular and so what we need to do is we need to put our images put a photograph put put our spot colors on these so that we'll know what they are now often when we print and we're trying to pick a spot color let's say we're trying to match a school color or color on a business card something like that a small chart like this small RGB chart will not allow us to pick pick accurate spot colors so my recommendation is if you fall in love with with colored shirts like I have is that you transfer a larger chart and I carry this with this this this chart with me practically everywhere I don't have one that I could get my hands on quickly on fabrics but I should but anyway this is the palette that I'm in love with it's called the Pantone go goe and I recommend that that you transfer this chart and you can get this from us it's part of CorelDraw in most programs and transfer its shirt with this number of colors which i think is about 2000 colors you have a very good chance of nailing whatever spot color you want and so for instance let's say that we were looking to match a school color well we would go get an object from the school and match that one things you could also do with this is some of the shirts and I'm looking to see if I can put my hands on one very quickly here they have colors they have ribs and I think those are called the Phenom shirts and so you could print out this chart and you could use it to match the the rib color of the shirt and that's a common thing to try to make it look really nice and match that and you've got our website and see the Phenom shirts they're very nice and understand vapors coming out with all sorts of neat shirts that are orientated towards vertical markets like cycling or something like that so those folks at vapor are always working very hard to come out with with new styles to keep our sub lemaitre's out there helping them please their clients so the point of this video is to tell you that you can get I think excellent results sublimating to that's number one number two is often a sub lemaitre's we'll say to ourselves well we don't think it's good enough for instance when we put it on but let's say this photograph right here on yellow we don't think that's good enough but I'll tell you what the the eyes of your client and how their brain works they'll look at this and they'll say wow that looks awesome and and that's what people are looking for they're looking for something that looks a little bit different than the norm okay and and that's one of the great things that you can offer is you can offer value that maybe they can't get anywhere else so I strongly recommend that you contact your county rep get you a collection of some of the more popular vapor colored shirts and make your transfers and show them to your clients I think you'll be surprised it's pleasantly surprised by what your clients are saying about them and I think it'll open new markets to you and give you give you something fresh to show your climb well welcome your feedback on this and one of the great ways that you can provide us feedback as well as share with others is take a picture of the shirt or whatever you're making and post it to our client gallery on our website that's a great way for you to see what others are doing get some ideas of your own so that you can bring that value to your clients well till we meet again this is David gross with conde systems thank you [Music] [Music] you", "phBuY4uZvnU": "all right guys I apologize for all I'm always going on the background my son is currently in the living room with me but yeah so I'm gonna go ahead and print this logo from his YouTube channel on to one of my shirts it's super simple I mean once you have something designed all you have to do is print it your inkjet or to your home printer the same way you would print any other document I've had a shirt that's been printed for a very long time now and I'll show you that as well it's like just a small little circle that says border detail season and it's like a piece of sweet bread or a crunch ow and I even scratch that I've washed that garment or that shirt over and over already I think I wear at least once a week or as soon as my as my fianc\u00e9e claims that I wear it so I know it's durable one of my son's birthday shirts was printed in this as well and it has been extremely durable and this you know people are asked well if you can't do full print color shirts what would you use this you know material for and it really is that you know it's really good for small logos it's really good for kid shirts like birthday party shirts you know how they always want some type of design and it's falling color with their name similar to the logo it's really good for those type of location occasions but it actually does last you know as opposed to a lot of these other birthday shirts or party shirts that you find on that teehee or your local market please wear their Walmart iron-on and the crack really quick this is not so without further adue you know let's go ahead and print this guy and let's show you the process of how to get this onto a shirt are you guys so look like a regular sheet of paper it's not go ahead and put it facedown that's kind of the orientation you put in so for low iron arms and on the design you have to flip it over because you typically cut it and you like flip it or something on this you just print as it is you don't have to reverse the image like when you do vinyl cutting so you print as it is regular and yeah let's continue alright guys so I'm just gonna kind of go through the settings that I use messages that I have found so yeah second screen recording I know but I don't feel like doing all that right now so it resides it's later it's a regular day and a half by you know half by 11 sheet of paper you're gonna leave it that's plain paper do not do photography because it'll saturate it too much and it'll be a little bit more difficult for you to kind of heal or to seal the the print the print quality is where you want to go ahead and click best I do use an HP printer and I'll tell you why in a little bit color same portrait same for both sides now all this stuff is the same and then also what I'm going to do is I'm going to switch this to landscape almost forgot so we're gonna click and so now it's flip the orientation mode in here all this stuff pretty much stays the same I do click sheet to fit unless you're positive that your margins are exactly but this is a pretty large print that I'm in so I want to make sure you print properly and I know the camera looks pretty vibrant and it is it is kind of library but when you put it on the garment it becomes a more vibrant I don't know what it is about using the heat press that kind of makes them much more much more colorful alright so for this next part all you're gonna need is literally the paper you just cut you just print it out or the I don't know I guess you have called it heat transfer paper that's what the proper term is oh and some scissors now is there a way to cut this out with your vinyl cutter yes there is but I will be showing you how to do that in a further video so that you can learn how to cut out perfect silhouette shapes with any model cutter a Cricut explore two for my fiance and then I have my big us cutter vinyl cutter over here I'm gonna go ahead and cut this guy out and they all show you the type of material this thing is I get to the touch it feels like a regular sheet of paper but it's really neat how this works so a quick tip I would recommend guys especially if you don't black garments I sell a black garment this will startle off whatever your design is put a very thick black border around everything that way makes it easy to kind of cut a along the line and if it's white then you do like a white border sort of thing with a little thin black outline that will you cut along the line and you're able to get those nice contours and you don't you don't mess up or show none of the exposed bone oil or expose heat transfer paper where there's no pink because as you cut this the scissors are little rough on him it's not like it's not they're not as precise as your vinyl cutter and so what happens is you'll expose some of the the heat transfer paper without ink and so it looks a little bit unprofessional I guess you would say all right finally done I know the more the details are the more curves and shape that you have the more difficult this becomes but I still have a couple of white areas to weed out I guess or cut out I'm gonna do that with the exacto knife you kind of look at their little white areas but you can tell for the most part on the edges there I got a little cleanup to do like right there but you see where the scissors aren't very sharp it kind of lifts they left like a fuzzy but you can clean that up fairly easily but for the most part if you see there's just a nice black outline much white so it should press really well on to whatever garment I put it on I said I'm gonna go ahead and we lose out with the lack of knife so place them my little Raglan that I have here again I'm just kind of doing this for demonstration this is not a professionally made strip I'm just trying to you know for doing purposes I'm gonna press it down so I get the moisture out I know you can see you 160 16 seconds counting down over here now you can't see on the camera doesn't need to be that long just a couple of seconds so that's kind of ready little heat transfer you take the backing off of course let's have the backing on it you kind of see well be a little careful especially when you're going around there's you've cut or where there's holes and I forgot to mention guys there is two versions of this paper there is the dark garment version and the light permit I always purchase the dark no matter what even if I'm putting it on Lars on dark garnet I see that because on the light garnet version of this guy you have to get the transfer paper with it and then so you have to print everything in Reverse and then there's just much more steps for you're not really saving any type of money so go ahead and set that what we wanted I'm go ahead and put my little silicone sheet over this like that now let me go ahead and press it for a 16 seconds put as much pressure as you can typically what I do that boy like to give them a little bit of a texture so I I remove it and then I kind of do it again for the paper up like this the thing that I go fibers I run across the silicon paper so it gives it like there's a nice little square pattern on the print and the final print so we're gonna go ahead and press it one more time this time only for half the time which is 8 seconds nice and so I don't know if you could tell from when it was sitting laying down before I press it but you can definitely tell how the color has came out now so let me go ahead and switch camera angles and I'll show you the final print hi guys so this is the final print check that out look how vibrant the colors are I really can't explain how much more vibrant they become after it is pressed it's hard to to to show it on the camera but man these colors are super vibrant now the the material is stretchy you know you're not gonna rip it on the first there were a couple of tries it feels nice to the touch after you heat it up now I will say one thing you know after you wear it you know if you don't iron it the day of wiring is or thrown in the dryer it will feel hard it doesn't feel as hard as paper or crinkly like paper but it does feel you know like a little bit I see you for the way you can fix that or tell your client says you know if you plan on wearing it that week just make sure you thread in the dryer at some point or when you iron it turn it inside out and just be gentle when you're ironing over it so you can kind of heat up the vinyl and just make it stretch again if you guys are gonna like me to try the light garment version go ahead and leave a comment below earlier I did tell you I use HP for printing and I'll tell you guys why I don't want a little cheat code in a life so HP with their new printers have what's called HP instant ink and so what that is you pay a monthly fee instead of you having to go out and buy cartridges every single time you need them you pay a single monthly fee I think I'm subscribed to the 50 prints a month and then I believe three dollars and 99 cents a night a month for 50 prints and of course and I have roll over from the previous month I can still use them what's great about it is yes you pay one monthly fee but the coolest thing is you don't really run out of ink once your printer starts kind of notices running low lately I automatically send you a new cartridge I'm not affiliated with HP at all I don't even have a code or anything I'm just kind of you know raving about their services because it honestly has been a godsend you know ink used to be super expensive to where you couldn't really do this type of stuff at home I mean it wasn't cost productive but now with this type of subscription you definitely can and they have different tiers they have you know the one I'm using for 50 pages on one which is 399 or $2.99 they have a 100 page or 500 page I mean you can go on and on and on until you know I'm guessing even into the business level but for somebody that learned something from home I definitely recommend you get in the newer HP inkjet printer which are not expensive at all make sure have instant ink logo on them or instant ink ready I showed you what type of printer I have and I also link that in the description the type of printer I'm using it also makes everything easier because it's super dense Wireless you don't have to ever connect the cable to your computer I don't know you know it is my computer's in my living room and my predators in the dining room and I keep pressing anything else in or laundry but I'll definitely get an HP printer guys all right so that's probably as I have a shirt here that I printed I would say it's around three months but I'll have this shirt and I wear it like I said at least once a week so I get to watch once a week and you can see kind of print quality that's still on here now these little things are part of the prayer I know looks like it's kind of faded right there but they're partly were part of the print so I do apologize for that and guys look I'm literally scratching at this with my nail as hard as I can I mean the color does not come off it doesn't flake it doesn't peel I mean and and what I mean see like so this year has been sitting for a good I would say week now I'm getting ready for this tomorrow actually but like if you listened it's a little plastic you don't throw it in the washer I mean in the dryer or you know iron it a little bit nothing look at that guys still nice and flexible it doesn't have been cracked no I pull hard enough am I gonna crack it yes but for you know small graphic teens like this it's great you know for birthday shirts or advanced you know family reunions anything nice I mean I you can put a picture on there's a portrait on this and it'll it'll be vibrant and and nice now I've never tried on any other printer besides an HP printer so please you know if you have for example a Canon an Epson a brother or whatever I apologize if the quality is not the same I can tap you know vouch for those those printers but I know the HP I've had an older version of my inkjet printer and this is a newer one that I read recently acquired and they worked great you know they work amazing so I think the total cost to print for me you know is you know I think it's around 80 70 cents I was a 72 cents a print when you buy the paper in bulk and you built the HP instant ink like I'm doing thanks so much for watching guys do you like these type of videos if so please hit that like button it definitely helps more than you think please subscribe to the channel comment below what type of video you like to see and I would love to you know invest a little bit of money and investigate for you guys and you know get to the bottom of whatever you guys it is it is the owners thinking is our product you want me to try you know in this industry anyways thank you so much for watching guys you",

this trend that i keep seeing on tiktok where they are taking poly acrylic and mixing it with water and spraying on their 100 cotton and poly cotton blend t-shirt and making sublimation stick to it um i really do want to try this i'm a little bit skeptical because i have bought like dye sub sprays before and they didn't work uh again it might not have been the product it could have been me and user error i don't even have it anymore to even try it again but i thought we could try this and see what happens so i have a couple different shirts here i have just a 100 um heavy cotton t-shirt then i have a 50 50 color and then i have another 100 cotton shirt but this is a soft style not sure if there's going to be a difference with that but i did want to try and then i have another 50 50 that is already bleached that i'm gonna put an image on and let's see if it makes my image any brighter so what i did was is i put 16 since i'm doing so many shirts and i'm trying on so many i did 16 ounces of water in here and then i added four four tablespoons of the poly acrylic into here and just kind of mixed it up um i already had this um i'm not sure if the semi-gloss or any of that really matters but i already had this so i wasn't gonna go out and buy anything just to try something and then it not work but anyway let's i'm going to go print out my images for these shirts real quick and then we'll be back at the heat press all right so now i'm just going to give my little mix a or my little mixture a little shape just make sure nothing's settled at the bottom make sure and all i'm going to do is just spray this all over the shirt that's on the pad i'm gonna take another piece of parchment paper i'm gonna lay on top and just kind of rub it and i'm gonna press it at 350 for 30 seconds all right so now you're going to go back in with a second coat um but it doesn't have to be as heavy of a coat i put my parchment paper on here again and i'm using this because i don't want to burn my garment and i don't want anything to bleed onto my heat press either i'm gonna do for another 30 seconds so what i'm gonna do is i'm going to pre-press all my shirts like this that i have or i don't know i'm gonna go set this one to the side and do my other two shirts all right so now that we have this one set and ready to go i'm gonna up my heat press to 400 degrees and once that gets there we'll be back all right this is the image that we're going to put on this to center forty another piece of parchment paper and i'm going to heat press it at 400 for um 50 seconds okay so this is the heavy cotton my paper is sticking to my shirt i don't know if it's supposed to be what is and this is the heavy cotton this is what it turned out i'm gonna throw it in the wash and see if it fades all right so now we're going to do the 5050 seconds sorry all right so this is on the 50 50 um i think it did better on this one than it did on the cottons but we're about to see i'm about to put them both in the wash or all three of them on the wash and see how they turn out all right so i'm back with the update on these shirts so i ended up not doing all the colors like i initially thought i didn't want to waste any shirts and i had like a bunch i was gonna do and i'm like let's not do that let's not waste anything if this doesn't work um so i only did the 4t which was the heavy cotton i did the 100 cotton soft style and then i did the 50 50 bleach um i don't have the 50 50 bleach on hand because that was actually an order and i had to get it i had to get it out um but i'll tell you it didn't change um there wasn't much of a difference on it once it was washed it faded out like it normally would with the 5050s um maybe it was a little bit darker but not much i didn't i didn't see that much of a difference in that one um now i did find a difference in the cottons so this is the heavy cotton here this is one wash um i'm gonna move this in so maybe you can see the she is anything that was black is now brown uh darker brown so it did fade a little bit after one wash on that one this one i did two washes and this is the soft style on here it looks a little bit darker but on the blue line you can kind of see where it's faded it's not um it's not that not that dark as it would be on a 100 cotton um does this work yes it does work but the there's no quality in this it's still going to fade over time it works initially um but this is just going to keep fading the more you wash it the more it's going to fade it gives you a little bit longer durability on the cotton if you was just to do a cotton one time it would just fade right out um but i i wouldn't sell these personally i would not sell these to my customers because within a corner how many times they wear the shirt within four washes it's just gonna wash right out or be like super faint so i don't i don't recommend this i don't recommend selling this now if you have like an event that you're doing yourself or something that you have shirts it's just gonna be like a one or two time wear i would probably do it it would save you money instead of doing polyester shirts um but that's it i wouldn't sell these other than that they're just gonna keep washing out um like i said it does work it does work it's not a myth i couldn't find any videos on youtube about it which i thought was like kind of weird um i think i found one but i didn't get any information off of that video so there was the only information i could get from this was through tick tock and those are like literally one minute videos so there wasn't much information there um i seen one girl on tick tock that she said it didn't work for her either and she wouldn't sell them as well so then i seen other people that it some way shape or form worked for them i don't know what i did wrong i went by everything that i seen and all that and it just didn't didn't really work for me um but if you guys have done it please leave a comment down below and let me know what what you did if it worked for you if it didn't work for you how many washes you got out of it so you notice the difference i would really like to know if there's something that i did wrong um but yeah if you guys have any questions or comment again leave them down below i try to answer and respond to everyone that i can and as well as please don't forget to give this video a like and a subscribe i would greatly appreciate it you guys have a wonderful rest of your day", "TS3IpvXLOfc": "hello again it's brett with shirtspace.com today we're going to talk

show you how to cut up shirts like Adam Sachs from ed hardy the first thing that almost always has to go is the collar so we're going to cut that off and remember you can always cut more but you can't cut less so just cut right on the other side of that seam holding the collar on and stretching is another thing that we're really going to be doing a lot of the next thing we're going to do is decide where we want our cuts so we're going to take some right down the middle here in order to do that if it's not on someone and you can't just see where the middle is we're going to fold it in half and line up your shoulder seams and your side seams if you have them if you don't just line up your arm holes and your shoulder seams and try and get your shirt nice and smooth like so then it's all about cutting little stripes into your shirt in any shape you want so we're going to go strip strip right down the front about the same width until we get under the bust then we're going to make them a little wider so we don't mind showing the belly a little bit you want to keep them about the same distance apart but you can just make them deeper cuts again you can always cut more but you can't cut less also want to cut off the bottom of the shirt and then we're going to stretch so now I'm going to show you basic weave stitch for t-shirts so you want to take reach underneath your first one pull up your second one and then pull it over so that you can pull the third one up through the second one and down then grab your fourth one up through their third one and just carry on like that it's very simple all the way making sure you don't skip any just reach your fingers through grab the next one pull it up carry it on all the way once you start getting towards the end whether that's the top or the bottom what you're going to do is bring your last one through you can either cut it off and tie it to itself around each side or get another strip of fabric from somewhere else on the t-shirt like along the bottom stretch that out which will make it much longer and loop it through there and then this is going to tie around behind the neck and to do that we can make a little hole in the back here for now we'll probably put another weave in the back and then this can attach to the top of that one and it will be glorious but in the meantime we will just tie it around to the back this has been mo of mo West creations ciao Hey", "D5GaEJ2wfT0": "hi guys so today we are going to be making a t-shirt from start to finish so I'll show you how to make the text what to do with the text how to cut it out and then how to press it to your shirt so first things first we're gonna make a text box and I have this heart excuse me it's just makeup um I have this heart here because I'm gonna use this heart on the shirt and it took me forever to find it so I didn't want to subject you guys to search for it again so first we are gonna make a text box by clicking right over here and I am going to be using the font called lipstick lettering this looks like it is a Cricut font so I always get asked what font is it where do I get the font so this font is lipstick lettering and it is from Cricut so the shirt I'm gonna make is going to say mom life not for me I am NOT a mom I'm making this for my sister-in-law so um so if you're new to my channel she has a set of twins and eight now 10 year old so she deserves this out of anybody so we have our text here so now with a script font like this where the letters should be touching together we want to make all of these letters touch together so there's two ways you can do this one is to just decrease the letters spacing like this so now they're touching or you can ungroup the entire set of text by clicking ungroup over here so if you didn't see that so you just select the text and click ungroup and now you can move the letters to where you want it both ways work fine it's just personal preference if you have like a ton of text sometimes it's a little bit easier to undelete it yourself but completely up to you so I'm just gonna move this a little bit and then I'm just gonna have this heart go right underneath it so no real right or wrong way to do this just kind of wherever I kind of like it a little off-center so that is basically our design that's pretty much it so now that we have our design how we want it and actually I will say too this is not my idea this is a shirt that she found online that she liked so I am kind of doing the version of it so just wanted to throw that out there so now that we have our design how we want it we want to make this all one chunk of text so it all cuts out together in this how it's organized here on the mat so what we can't sameen all right so um why does this look this mom looks smaller than the rest of the text so I'm just gonna make it there we go so what we want to do is we want to use our weld function down here and basically that's gonna weld everything together so it all cuts out as one chunk so nothing is loose like it is right now so to do that all you need to do is click and just how I like to do is I just highlight everything so now all of our text our heart everything is selected so now our weld button over here is lit up so we're just going to hit weld and so now it's one big chunk of text super-easy see so this is basically it does all we have to do for our shirt so now we're gonna go over to make it and most important when doing a t-shirt or using heat transfer vinyl or HTV or some kind of iron-on you need to mirror your image so all you need to do to do that is click this little mirror button over here and turn it on and so basically you can see it's gonna make your design mirrored or backwards and that's because when we apply it to the shirt we're gonna be flipping it over so we're gonna be pressing it you know right-side up so it's hard to explain but I will I will walk you through it once I switch you guys to the camera so it's much easier than it sounds but the bottom line is make sure you mirror your text or your image it's going to look backwards but that is what we want okay now that I have scolded you all no I'm just kidding now we can move on to actually making it so we just hit continue it's gonna find our machine and then we will choose our settings okay so the material that we are gonna use is the everyday iron on here and I know you guys can probably see I changed my so the mom life is gonna be in green and then the heart is gonna be in black I had a conversation with my sister-in-law as I was doing this and she wanted green and black so we're good to go so now you can see it's telling us make sure mirror is turned on and the iron on material is faced shiny side down on the mat so I'll switch you guys over to the camera so you can see how exactly we are going to do that okay so first we are gonna cut our green and so I'm gonna use my light grip blue mat for this it is cool white dirty so we want to make sure we so you can see that the HTV has this really shiny side and then there's like this matte dull side so we want to make sure we put the shiny side face down so the matte side is face up that is because the shiny side that is like the carrier sheet and so that's why we had to mirror our design so basically it's gonna get cut out backwards out of this and then we're gonna flip it over and that's how we press it so it sits so like this dull side that's the side that's gonna get pressed down to the t-shirt so we keep oh my god sorry guys so we can pull out our machine so we have our HTV scrape down relatively well it's not perfect so now we can load our mat and we know that our mat is ready to be loaded when this is blinking so we'll load our mat and we can cut I really should get a new mat I just I'm so lazy you guys as long as it gets cut up here we'll be fine cuz down here is not gonna matter I just always cut in excess just in case okay so while I unload this I just grabbed my heat press I'm gonna turn it on and get that warmed up all right so we can unload our mat you can set this aside for now so now I'm going to cut out the heart on this black HTV so same thing we're gonna make sure we put these shiny side down on our mat load our mat and we can cut and that one should take no time at all so while that is cutting I'm just gonna cut out the text and so now this excess stuff I can just put it in my archive save it for later all right so we're done with our machine so now fun part or one of my favorite parts is we get to lead this and I love weeding HTV because it is so easy so this is sizer Caesar I have no idea how to pronounce it easy weed so I'll light and if you have a weeding tool you can use that I just have my scissor or my tweezers because I have no idea where my weeding tool is but I like to just pull up a corner and just start pulling so we're gonna be pulling away the negative space so we're left with the actual text all right so now we'll weed out the Middle's of the letters okay so we have our mom life and now I'm just going to cut out the heart and again same thing I'm just gonna pull up a corner and just pull away alright so we have our heart we have our text so I'm gonna clean up my scraps and the heat press is ready to go and so we will start pressing okay so we are ready to press our shirt so a couple of things one I know this is a little wrinkled don't come for me you know it's a little bit wrinkled but everything's gonna be fine I just took it out of the package well you know make sure it's presentable for her um secondly you want to make sure you spread it out as flat as possible and you do not press any of the seams or if there's like a fold underneath or if some of the material is kind of like bunched up underneath you want to make sure that you completely flatten the surface that you're going to press the reason is is because I've experienced like if I press a seam for some reason it like burnt it tends to burn the seam or just just I don't know it looked and gives it a weird look so just try and get as flat as possible now for placement I know there's a lot of likes you know kind of like charts out there that say like two inches from the collar or whatever and I tend to kind of stick to that but also I kind of just eyeball it and see what I kind of like so I just kind of place it where I think it's going to look the best so that is not good advice but that's how I do it so I'm going to do something like this and then I'll put the heart underneath once I get this mom life pressed first and what I also like to do to see if it's like relatively centered as I'll just do a quick kind of measurement so that's about 4 and a quarter and that's about four and a half so I can probably move it over just a hair so that's about four and a quarter and that's pretty close to four and a quarter so this the L the tallest part is about two inches from the collar so I think that looks pretty good and then we'll do the heart just like right down here so it'll look cute okay so now that we have everything placed where we want it I like to put a piece of parchment paper or Teflon over it just to protect mostly to protect the shirt just to make sure I don't burn it and I'm going to be using my easy press today so I'm gonna be pressing at 305 degrees for about 50 I'll start it off about 15 seconds and then if we need to press it more we will you can a hundred percent do this with an iron yes you could do this with an iron I've done many shirts with an iron before so if you are doing it with an iron you're just gonna want to make sure it's on its hottest setting you turn off the seam completely and you've given a lot of pressure Capisce okay so I'm gonna be using my heat press so it is ready to go we're ready to press so I'm just gonna bring it over and I'm going to set it down and give it good pressure set the timer for about 15 seconds and then I'll lift it up so I'm pressing it down giving it good pressure all right lift it up and we'll know if we pressed it hard enough if this just comes off super easy which it does yay and you can also know you can also tell if it's pressed enough because if you look at it you won't be able to see it but you can see like the fibers in the shirt so that's another way to see if you've pressed it hard enough okay so we have that so now we're gonna press the heart I kind of like it off-center so I hope she does too all right so I'm just gonna press the heart and I'm gonna put this back over just to protect that each TV just so I don't melt it so I'm gonna put my Teflon or parchment back on and I'm gonna give this one more press for 15 seconds and I'm gonna focus most of my pressure on the heart I mean that's kind of hard to do but you know everything's gonna get really nicely pressed all right so now we can unpin from there and unpeel from here and so we have our super cute shirt alright guys so that is it for our super cute mom life shirt I hope she likes it and if she doesn't she's lucky because I love her and I'll do it for her again but anyways I hope this helped you if you have any questions make sure you leave me a comment don't forget to Like and subscribe and as always happy crafting", "9yNtHyCRwww": "hey what is wrong guys this is planning today we want to talk about the best basic tees and where to buy them now today I do have my blue snowball right here I am testing out the microphone to see what this produced I go so yeah let's get into the review so the tee I have on right now and the TI I'm gonna show you guys right now is the Hanes beefy T now I don't if we don't have you kind of using Gildan that's kind of a cheap really cheap basic tee and then I made using some pretty much kind of like the top quality of t-shirts so the paint BP tease I think come in at around 350 I didn't buy my stuff on the website jiffy shirts and that's a really good website really good price isn't really good shipping they're pretty much competitive pricing so I think that's a really good site to use and the t-shirt I'll be comparing what their pains be PT is the comfort color I don't know what is a exact kind of model name but I do know that this is the kind of top quality version is the heavyweight e so we'll get into both of these CDs now do believe the fabric of both tees way around six point one I do believe is the weight which is kind of the standard white heavy weight t supreme tees are definitely in that heavyweight category they're like very nice and thick thick and they're pretty like solid and they feel really soft now this t-shirt nearly cost twice as much as the HD PT the quality is like slightly softer but I don't think that really worth the money I just want to comment for this reason of this video but it's not really like that much of it increase for the price late it does have a little bit more of a premium feel to it the tag is obviously a natural tag it feels very solid very nice the haints wind just printed on except for the navy color weight for some reason it is on it actually the actual tag so yeah I think this is 650 and the Hanes beefy T's around 350 so you'd not think that this is really worth the price maybe it handles better after wash I don't really know but so I can't really tell you guys on that maybe that's where the value really comes in but this will live it more of a like wife and slightly softer more buttery feel I don't think that's only wore three extra dollars when I stack qat the main reason I'm making these videos is let you guys know that you believe that buying plain of blank tees there's a lot better deal than going to a place like H&M and bind them because they're usually a bit more expensive and I go that the card is even that good because when you bite miss tortoise more layers to it and got an extra Kostas shirt when this one you buying it fairly close to the menu Patrick now the Gildan one is around 180 one one dollar fifty to one dollar eighty now I don't think that guilt is really worth it just for living more money get a much more premium t-shirt you get that a soft feeling a bit compared to the Gilda it's like obviously very very rough this feels soft and nice so I think that the price is really really what they put it ain't beefy cheese probably the best one for the price out there now these tees fit true to size they fit liver smaller than supreme so pretty bit slightly oversized and up old supreme cheese I'll live it's more my opinion so I think this one to decide I do believe we got these teeth like drippy shots very very good price very good shipping very fast and it's just overall really good place to buy blank tees yes a lot of different options you gonna starting brand you want your different bad breaks that you could go on the website these are the things I always like body body stand this is navy this is I think sage for their comfort color one and I think this is cost don't wash greed now this is kind of closer to the supreme stage actually and then this is Maru we got I will leave a link to Jimmy shirt and the links to these two teas in the Lipton down below I'll also leave a link to the Gildan one you guys want to be like that super stupid sheet beat it assured you guys can mess it up don't really give a crap about it and just like beat it up and then like get a new one so dance often is video hopefully this video helped you guys out a little bit if it did please jump it like below rotary please chef everything like you guys know me thank you for watching and I will see you guys next time peace out why did I just do that he [Music] you [Music]", "M02QVTxhOM0": "- Hey everybody, so my last video I talked about how anyone can get started selling T-shirts online\nfor some extra side money with print-on-demand and\nhow you can even scale it to a full-time income. So in this video, I thought I would take\nyou behind the curtain to show you one of my\nprint-on-demand sites and my eCommerce portfolio that has sold well over a\nmillion dollars in T-shirts. And I'm also gonna take\nyou through 10 things that you need to do before you start selling\nT-shirts to make money online. Now for some of these\nthings, if you skip them, you still might make money\nin your T-shirt business, but you will lose out\non a lot of extra money that you could have had. But for others on the\nlist, it's much worse because if you don't do these things, then you might end up putting your T-shirt business at risk. And just to clarify for\nthose of you that don't know what the phrase print-on-demand is because we have had a lot\nof new subscribers lately. Here is how it works. It's when you print products individually as customers order them. So, for example, there\nare merchandise companies like Printify that will let you upload artwork to their website and then place it on to\nproducts like T-shirts, which you can then list\nand sell in your own store. And then when a customer comes and buys one of the T-shirts from you Printify will then print\nthe design onto the T-shirt and then ship it out to\nthe customer for you. Automatically without you\nhaving to do anything. So yes, print-on-demand is pretty cool. So we've got 10 things to discuss so let's just jump straight into it. One, choose one niche market\nto zoom in on and master. Now there is one exception to this, which I will explain later, but for most people who are looking to start a T-shirt business,\nI very much recommend that you choose a niche market and you focus in on it. So this is one of the stores\nin my eCommerce portfolio and as I said, this one is quite unique because it's done well over\n$1 million worth of T-shirts. So the sales number that was on the screen was the total sales for the store. This is actually a flex store. It sources and sells\nproducts in multiple ways, but the main way it does it\nis through print-on-demand. So what you can do inside\nof Shopify's report section is choose to filter the\nresults by product type. There are much more complex\nfilters that you can use and honestly, as a store\nowner and marketer, this feature is wonderful and\nI'm gonna be using it a lot in this video. But yes, by filtering the results we can see that more than half\nof the sales in this store came from T-shirts. That's a lot of T-shirts. And you know what? All of those T-shirts were\ntargeting one single niche. Yep, all of those T-shirts were\ntargeting one single niche. And, of course, for those\nof you watching out there that don't know the word niche, which can be also said as\nniche, both ways are fine, means to target a distinct\nsegment of a market. In other words, having specific appeal to a targeted group of people. So, for example, if you had\na store targeting pet owners with products for cat owners, dog owners, fish owners, and dragon owners that would be a general store. But if you were to instead just focus in on one specific\npet owner, such as dogs, that would be a niche store. I was reminded the other\nday why I had personally had a whole lot more success with niche stores over general stores when\nI received this comment from a viewer. \"Hi, Sarah, I want to know\nif I'm on the right track. \"I'm aiming to two main subjects,\nHome Depot and clothing. \"For Home Depot, I'll be\nselling things like paintings, \"cups, accessories and things\nfor each section of the house, \"kitchen, bedroom,\nliving room and bathroom. \"For clothes, I'm aiming for women, men, \"babies and especially pets. \"So am I being greedy\naiming for too many things?\" Yes. Let's be honest, mate. The only thing that women, men, babies and pets have in common\nis that they have a pulse and they all living in houses. So I was recently talking\nto my friend, Fred, who literally spends millions\nof dollars every year advertising his niche stores, and I was talking to him about\nhow I get lots of questions from people in the comments\nwanting to set up general stores and he said to me, \"By why\ndo they wanna do that?\" and I said to him, \"It's\nbecause of the fact \"that they think that if they\ntarget one specific niche \"that they're not gonna be\nable to scale their store \"since they will run out\nof products to sell in it.\" And he looked at me\nbefuddled and he's like, \"But it's the opposite. \"Niche stores are easier to\nscale than general stores.\" and I agreed. The reason why we genuinely believe this is because when you have a niche store you're building up a\ncustomer base of people that you know are passionate\nabout one specific thing and what that means then is it much easier to launch new products again and again, and have your previous customers come back to buy your newly launched products, and this is especially true\nwith print-on-demand stores like T-shirts business where you can essentially\ncreate unlimited products. You are only limited by your imagination or by your designer's imagination. Whereas with a general\nstore, your customer list is very fragmented. It's pretty much summed\nup by that famous phrase. Jack of all trades, master of none. That's why as you can see, this\nis not a one product store. This is a long-term store and it has sold many different designs with lots of repeat customers. I get a lot of people ask\nme about one product stores and I'm sorry people,\nbut those just aren't the sort of stores that I\npersonally invest in to. So don't expect them for this channel. But like with all things in life I've got friends who\nreally like general stores and they can probably\nargue their case very well. So remember, in life\nthere is no best business. There are just different businesses. However, I genuinely believe\nthat niche stores are easier especially for beginners to market, but as I said there is\none exception to this. Two, consider opening a general store on third party eCommerce platform. Yes, this is the exception to that. T-shirt business is on a\nthird party eCommerce website like Redbubble or Merch by Amazon you should very much consider that. Why, well, it's because\nRedbubble and Merch By Amazon are general stores. So you're essentially listing\nyour T-shirts for sale on what is already an\nextremely large general store and you don't have control over marketing to previous customers. It's Redbubble and Amazon that do that. So you don't get the same\nbenefit from niching down and branding your store. Because think about it, here's a T-shirt that a\nseller is selling on Amazon using the print-on-demand\nprogram, Merch By Amazon, and if we use the Amazon sales\nresearch tool, Jungle Scout, we can see in the past month it estimates that they have\nmade thousands of dollars, which is pretty cool. However, when a customer\ncomes and buys this T-shirt they will have other products\nup-sold to them on Amazon, and you know what, these products here they are not the seller's products. They are the products\nfrom their competitors. What this all means then is that on a third party\neCommerce site like Amazon you don't get the same advantage that you get in your own store where you can create a curated\nexperience for your customer where you can control the customer journey and up-sell them to multiple\nproducts by niching down. Three, add simple text-based\nT-shirts as cross-sells and up-sells, and to pad out your store. One of the challenging things about starting a T-shirt\nbusiness is the design part. Even if you yourself are a designer, it still takes a lot of\ntime and creative energy to come up new great designs. So that is why, if you ask for\nany URLs to my stores I own, nope, I'm not gonna give them to you. So that you can come in and steal my IPs. But anyway, moving on. Something I've highlighted\nbefore on this channel is that simple text-based\ndesigns can sell extremely well for humorous T-shirts,\nbut that doesn't mean that they only exclusively\nsell for humorous designs. Nope, so if we come back to my report on the top selling T-shirts in my store. You'll see that sitting\nat number 10 is this one that sold 835 shirts, and trust me, this design, it is painfully simple. Like painfully simple. Now, since I don't want\nto reveal my design IPs for people to steal, I have instead opted to create a similar example product in my example Shopify store Brewed Treets, and here it is. Yep, it literally is\njust a big block of text of a popular one word phrase in my niche on a basic T-shirt. And it's these sorts of\nT-shirts that anyone, regardless of designing\nabilities, can create Just by using simple, free apps like Canva and Pixlr's inbuilt\nopen source free fonts, anyone can create these\nsimple text-based designs, like this one, that made over $22,000. And you know what, that's just\n$22,000 from T-shirts alone. Coming back to the product sale report, I switched up the filters to show all of the\ndifferent types of products that also feature this\ndesign in the store, not just T-shirts, and\ncollectively this simple design has sold over $82,000\nacross all of its products that it's been printed on to. But while that's great and all, I have to stress, this is not a design that I would recommend\nsending paid traffic to. Paid traffic is expensive and so to turn a profit, especially if you're using\nFacebook or Instagram, you really need to have\nan eye-popping design that's gonna catch the attention of the person who's\nscrolling through their feed and you know what, designs like this, they're just not very visually engaging. Obviously as you can see though, preexisting shoppers who are\nin the mood to buy more things will add these simple text-based\ndesigns to their carts too, but they are best left for shoppers who have already found your\nwebsite through other products or free organic traffic, not paid traffic. Teaching how to create these simple text-based designs\nusing Canva is something that I teach in my\npremium training course, The Ecomm Clubhouse. If you're interested in\ncurated tutorial videos I'll have a link to it in\nthe video description below. Four, check what T-shirts you\nare selling to your customers. Here is something to be aware of. When it comes to T-shirts,\nnot all T-shirts are the same. So, for example, if we\nhead on over to Printify, you'll see that there are\nmultiple types of unisex T-shirts. There's this one here,\nwhich is $20.81 a shirt and then there's this one\nhere, which is $8.30 a shirt and then you have this\none, which is even cheaper, $7.10 a shirt. So you might be thinking,\nwhy is one T-shirt $21 and another T-shirt is\na third of the price? Well, it's because of this. Not all T-shirts are the same. So this cheap T-shirt here,\nthe actual make of the T-shirt is listed here. It's a Gildan 5000 whereas this more expensive\n$8.10 T-shirt here, this is Bella + Canvas 3001. These are two completely\ndifferent makes of T-shirts and thus, they have two\nvery different prices. This information is usually available for a free third party eCommerce platforms with print-on-demand\ncapabilities like Teespring, you just gotta look for it. For example, if you come\non over here to Teespring, you'll see that there\nare different T-shirts and you might think well,\nwhat's the difference between the $10.50 Tee and the $14.33 Tee So to find out, you just gotta come to Teespring's product overview page. And here you'll get more detail on what brands that they use. So their premium tees use Next Level whereas their cheaper\ntees use either Hanes or Gildan, depending on\nwhere it's fulfilled from. So how can you choose\nwhich one's right for you? Well, actually it's pretty easy. Five, use Jiffy T-shirts\nto research reviews for different styles of T-shirts. So pretty much all\nprint-on-demand companies will list the different T-shirts that they use on their site. But there is one\nparticular company Printful which has an additional\nfeature, and it's this. Reviews. The print-on-demand store\nowners can leave reviews for different products. They usually aren't\nreviewing the print quality, more the T-shirt brand itself. So this T-shirt here, the Anvil 88VL has a 3.5\nstar rating out of five. Now on the surface that's not great is it? You probably think well, you\nknow, I'll avoid this T-shirt. But here is the thing. Four reviews? Statistically, that is pathetic. All it takes is for some\nsilly reviews to be left. This person here left a three star review with no complaints. They simply rated it three stars because they didn't know if\nthey liked the shirt or not yet. So to them, this was a neutral review. And this person here\ndidn't like the fabric and thinks it's bad. Yet, this person below\nthem really likes it. With such a small number of reviews you can't really know who\nwas right and who was wrong. So what you need to do is you\nneed to come to Jiffy Shirts, a T-shirt wholesale website and do a search for reviews\non that particular style and brand of T-shirt. And that will give you an\nactual true representation of the quality of it, and\nwhether people like it or not. When you do that you find\nthat actually this T-shirt is extremely well reviewed when you increase the\ncustomer sample size. Now when you're starting out and you don't have a strong brand yet, it's fine to use T-shirts like this to keep your starting costs low, but if you have an established\nstore like my one is, then like me you'll want to\nswitch to higher quality Tees with softer cotton. Two good brands that\nbalance cost with quality that are available on a lot\nof print-on-demand websites are Bella + Canvas and Anvil. Six, stop refunds by not\nselling T-shirt that run small. Okay, so if we come back\nto my report in Shopify, check it out, there have been\nover $1.5 million in sales with Tees in the store, after\nyou account for the discounts. And the refunds? Just $24,000, and when you calculate it, that is less than 2% refunds, which is way below industry\naverage for a store this size and do you know how you\nget a refund rate that low? By ensuring that you have happy customers. So when you come to a\nprint-on-demand website and you are choosing your\nTees, I strongly recommend, for the sake of simplicity\nto avoid T-shirts that feature this dreaded\ntext in their description. So, for example, let's compare\nthese two sizing charts. Here is one T-shirt. As the description says,\nit runs true to size. So if you scroll down to the sizing chart, we'll see the different\nsizes go up to three XL. Now, let's compare that\nto this T-shirt here, which runs small. If you scroll down to the bottom and check out that T-shirt's sizing chart, we'll see that the sizing\nis extremely different and that someone who fit a\nlarge T-shirt in the first one will not fit a large in the cut of T-shirt because it, well, is\ndrastically different. Here they are side-by-side\nand as you can see, the T-shirt that runs small does not scale as sizing goes up. And so when someone who\nnormally wears a large T-shirt, gets it, and it doesn't fit,\nthey go, huh, that's weird. Guess there's something\nwrong with my T-shirt and I need to get a refund. And even if they didn't assume that, if you normally wear a large T-shirt and the large T-shirt doesn't fit you, you know what? That's not a nice feeling. And not only will it mean then\nthat customers will feel bad because of the fact that\ntheir T-shirts don't fit them, but they'll also be less likely to order from you in the future because think about it, no-one who normally wears a large T-shirt wants to have to order a two XL. Having happy customers\nis extremely important when running an online store and it's something that I\ndiscuss in my free ebook. \"The Six Tips That Six\nFigure Online Stores Follow To Make Over $10,000 A\nMonth,\" and you'll find links to download that ebook in\nthe video description below. Seven, be aware that not all\nprint-on-demand providers do large prints. This is just a quickie, but keep in mind before you design your T-shirt, not all print-on-demand\nproviders do large designs. For example on Printify you don't order your\nT-shirts directly from them, they just act as a third party service that connects you to the\nprint-on-demand providers, and one of their suppliers that\nwill print onto this T-shirt is DTG2Go, and they have the capacity to print this design onto\nthis Bella + Canvas 3001 Tee. Whereas this other\nprovider, Monster Digital, can only print the\ndesign onto that same Tee at a smaller size. Now oftentimes this doesn't really matter, but there are some of you out there that might be designing your\nT-shirts to be a full print that goes over the whole T-shirt. So keep this in mind before\nyou start designing it. There is a slight work around for this when you're doing your marketing. Eight, pick product mock-ups\nto increase conversions. So here is a sneaky trick\nthat we use in the industry. So when you're using a\nprint-on-demand provider most of them will give you a\nvisual mock-up of the product that you are selling to be\nable to use to market it, but unfortunately these\nusually aren't all that great. So as my subscribers\nknow I usually recommend that you create your own product mock-ups to use in your own marketing. And the place that I often recommend is this website here Placeit. With Placeit, you can upload your design that you plan to print onto a T-shirt, Placeit will then create\nbeautiful mock-up pictures for you featuring your design\nthat you can then use to advertise and promote it. They are infinitely better than standard boring mock-up photos that print-on-demand providers give you. However, when you're choosing which mock-ups to use in your store keep in mind, if you are selling a T-shirt that features a small print or can only print onto a\nsmall area of the T-shirt when it comes to just the\nplain product mock-up photo it can look a little awkward. On a mock-up like this, the\ndesign looks really small in relation to the T-shirt itself, which it can make it\nless visually appealing and not pop as well. But there is a solution. And that is to use crumbled mock-ups or mock-ups where the T-shirt\nis tied in a knot like this. This helps to draw attention\naway from the empty fabric and instead draw attention\nto the design itself, increasing conversions by creating a more eye-popping picture. Nine, choose a T-shirt printing company that offers the services that you need. So here is another quick tip. Do you remember how there\nwere these two companies that Printify work with,\nDTG2Go and Monster Digital, that will both print onto the same shirt, but have different printing size areas? Well, that's not all that's\ndifferent about them. Monster Digital here, the only service that they have on offer is\nthey'll print whatever you want on the front and back of\nthe shirt and that's it. Whereas DTG2Go offers\nseveral other services. Not only will they print\non the front and back, but they'll always print on the sleeves and they will print a custom\nlabel for additional branding. Printing on the sleeves\nis free, I believe, but a custom label is\nnot, so keep that in mind. Now for most of you, the standard label that's\nalready on the shirt is absolutely fine, but\nif you were planning to have your own really\nhigh quality T-shirt brand, then you want to make sure\nthat that feature is included with the supplier that you choose. The same goes for Printful, they do all of their printing in-house, but not all T-shirts are\neligible for additional features like custom tags. So to check just filter the results and now you'll know which\nT-shirts to choose from. 10, check to see if your\nniche is about to die. Or if it is secretly a seasonal niche, so that you don't get catch\nout by any unexpected, unhappy surprises, when\nyour sales suddenly dip. So let me show you how to check this. So Google has a great\nfree tool, Google Trends. If we type in a phrase, such as SpongeBob, we'll see how much search\ninterest the phrase SpongeBob has received over time in Google. So if we set the results to show us how SpongeBob the show has trended over the past five years we'll see some interesting things, and as you can see, interest\nup until 2018 had kind of flattened out, but in 2019\nSpongeBob had a resurgence. So this tool is a great way to\nsee if interest in your niche that you plan to make and sell T-shirts in is about to rise or if it's about to fall. Case in point, there is an\nonline game called Happy Wheels, which has a huge online\ncommunity dedicated to it, but take a look at it on Google Trends. As you can see, the\noverall trend for the game, well, it's not good. So I highly recommend\nthat you come on here and you check out how your niche is doing. And something that I\nwant you to keep in mind is this as well. Even if your niche isn't\ndoing so hot right now, as SpongeBob showed us,\nniches they don't just fall, but they rise as well. So while it's probably a\ngood idea to think twice before you get into a niche\nwhich is in the middle of a rapid decline, if your\nniche interest is bottomed out then this could be a\nreally great time to get in to capitalize when your\nniche trends up again, which is exactly what\nhappened with Minecraft. Minecraft videos or\nrelated merch plummeted, but the creators who stuck\naround when it bottomed out got paid handsomely when it rose again. And by the way, while you\ndo have to be very careful if you want to piggyback off\nof popular IPs like SpongeBob when you're creating your own merch there are some ways to legally do it. Which I discuss in this video. There is another reason that\nyou should use this tool to double check your niche and that is because it\nmight actually secretly be a seasonal niche. So a niche that is seasonal that would probably\nsurprise no-one is baseball. If we take a look at baseball\nover the past five years we'll see that interest in it rises sharply when summer hits. But you know what? I've discovered something surprising. I've see plenty of successful\nprint-on-demand stores that focus on brands of trendy\ncars with big fan bases. And so I wondered how is the\nMini Cooper doing these days. When I did a search for\nit and I took a look back at the past five years,\nI was shocked to discover that this is, well, a seasonal niche. Interest in Mini Coopers\nrise as the summer hits and then it falls down over winter. Now perhaps because I'm\nnot a big car person, this is more surprising to me, so I decided to compare\nit to the Toyota Corolla and while interest definitely\ndips over winter for it, as a whole, it's not as\npronounced or as seasonal as the Mini Cooper. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with seasonal niches. It's absolutely normal. It's just nice to know\nabout this in advance so that when you see sales dip in the fall you don't freak out because you know that they're gonna rise\nagain in the summer.

"sGHrfC7fGzY": "this is a shirt wax product review for the Gildan ladies premium cotton t-shirt the GD 90 it's 100% cotton and is the heaviest weight that Gildan do in the latest fit the equivalent in the men's is the GD 0 8 it has quite a tight weave so it gives brilliant results for both screen printing and digital printing and it's a good choice for embroidery too because of the heavier weight of lead material in terms of weight the color t-shirts are 185 grams per square metre and as usual the white is slightly less at 180 this is a size small and I'm a size 10 so you can see how this fits on me it has a fairly standard sleeve length and slightly looser neckline that say the GD 72 it's also a little more roomy than the GD 72 in the sleeve area it has a nice comfortable length which gives good coverage and it's tapered fit through the side seams at the sides which also means that we can't print over the side seams now let me show you what it looks like in a medium so this is the medium and as you can see it's a much more loose fit it's very comfortable to wear but it's also not too big so I could also wear small or medium in this size depending on how I wanted it to look",

is Kenny and today I'm doing a review on ASOS design t-shirts [Music] this shirt right here is one of the ASA shirts that I bought the first thing I noticed when I put this on is how nice it fits I love how it wraps around the arm without leaving any extra fabric I also like how fitting it is around the chest without being too tight the one thing I didn't really like when I put it on was how loose it was around the stomach but after wearing it for a few hours it really wasn't that bad another thing that I noticed is that these shirts are longer than other shirts that I own I'm 5 foot 7 and I feel like these are slightly too long on me so if you're shorter than that you probably shouldn't get these I'm also wearing a size small when it comes to quality these feel very good on ASOS you can find the shirt in different colors for under $10 the quality you get for under $10 is actually really good at this price point you should be comparing these shirts to other cheap undershirts but this doesn't feel like an undershirt the quality and fit is enough to where you can wear this out this is another five to ten dollar t-shirt that I bought you can tell how cheap it is by the fit and the arms there's a lot of extra fabric and the shirt itself is very loose most of these five to ten dollar shirts are going to be loose [Music] now this is the same color shirt but from ASOS it's the same exact one as this t-shirt but just in a different color again you can tell how much better it fits especially in the arms each of these shirts are under ten dollars and they come in different colors you can also find them in a pack of five for around $40 or sometimes they have a sale I bought five of these shirts for under $30 like I said I didn't really like how it fit around the stomach area but after wearing it for a few hours it's starting to grow on me one more little thing I don't really like is how this area right here sticks up and that's on both sides that's just nitpicking

I am incredibly excited to show you the new product from Caesar which is their easy sub Lea so this product is revolutionary right now in our market because for the first time ever you are able to sublimate on continents dark fabrics fleeces and any other type of fabric that you can put in the heat press so while Caesar recommends that you use the EZ subway inks with the EZ subway vinyl we've been experimenting with a few different techniques and I'm gonna talk about those and show you what the difference is so here's what you're gonna need you'll need a computer a sublimation printer sublimation inks the C's are easy subway vinyl the EZ subway mask a cutter cut software the heat press your product that you're going to apply the vinyl to a squeegee scissors waiting tool and protective paper before you get started printing on your Caesar easy subway vinyl you first need to contact tech support with your computer and software info and they can set you up with the best settings for you alright so now that I've shown you what you need it's time to set up our cut software so there's many many different types of cutters and many different types of cuts software I have a great video out on conde TV that goes over all of that so if you need more information be sure to check it out for those of you that are already up to speed on that let's go ahead and go to our printer print out our vinyl and get started so now that we've pulled our vinyl off of the printer the very first thing we need to do is place it under the open heat press for at least a minute to allow that ink to dry I have here a image that I've already put under the heat press and you can see the difference in the vibrancy the heat really starts to activate the colors and it also dries it which is going to allow you to place it in your cutter without the ink smearing so to do that I'm just gonna place it right under my preheated heat press and let it sit there for about a minute now that we have our vinyl dried it's time to place it into the cutter I'm using the silhouette cameo so I'm going to place my image on my cameo sheet I'm gonna load it into the cutter and then send the cut file be sure to check Conde comm for all of the applicable cut settings for your cutter now that we have our vinyl cut it's time to weed it I'm just gonna take my weeding tool here and peel away my excess as you can see this product is super easy to weed so before we bring these to the heat press we need to mask them I have two different examples here because I want to show you that some of these actually don't need to be masked this artwork for instance can just be peeled directly off of the backing sheet because there's not a lot of detail in the vinyl so now this piece is ready to be placed directly on to the t-shirt and sublimated alright guys so now that we have cut and weeded our vinyl it's time to apply it to our t-shirt I'm using a 100% cotton black t-shirt the first thing I want to do is pre-press it so I'm gonna cover it with some butcher paper and I'm just gonna give it about a five second pre-press just to get any wrinkles and any moisture out of the fabric okay so once the free press is done I'm gonna take my vinyl and lay it exactly on to the shirt now I have two pieces here one piece is done with the subway jet HD ink and then this piece is done with the EZ subway inks so we're gonna press them both at the same time we're just gonna cover them with copy paper I'm sorry butcher paper and press so be sure to check condi comm for all of our techniques and tips all right let's see what we got well that looks pretty good so we're gonna let this cool and then I'm gonna show you the difference this piece needs to be masked because it has all of these little extra pieces that aren't going to just peel off in one piece so to do that we use the easy subway mask and the first thing that you want to do is peel it away from the backing and you can save this piece for later if you're not ready to press your item immediately so now that I have my sticky sheet ready I'm just going to lay it on top of my image use my squeegee and apply some pressure make sure you're using good firm pressure and now these two pieces can be separated I found that flipping it over and peeling the backing from the mask actually works a little bit easier and so now you can see all of these pieces are stuck to the backing paper and now they're ready to be transferred onto your shirt all right so now with the mask on here we need it needs to be peeled warm all right that looks great so I've showed you a couple of techniques on how to use the EZ subway vinyl and there's one more that I really want to talk about so in normal sublimation we print to sublimation paper and then we apply it to a polyester coated substrate so we can do the same thing here with the EZ subway vinyl so I have here a design the same design mirrored and printed out on regular sublimation paper then I have my vinyl which is unmarred and is pre-cut so I want to show you the difference between what this looks like compared to the sub low jet inks on the vinyl and then the EZ subway inks on the vinyl so I'm going to show you how to press this and then we'll compare the three together so I'm gonna press this on the same shirt the first thing I'm gonna do is remove my vinyl from the backing sheet and I'm going to tack it down for about five seconds now because we're doing a different method of sublimation the times and the temperatures are going to change a little bit so I'm gonna cover this with protective paper and I'm gonna tack it down so that's about all the time we need for that and then I have my image which has already been cut so that's gonna make it easier for me to to to line it up on my vinyl and then we're just gonna line it up I am gonna use a little bit of heat tape to tape it into place all right we're gonna cover it with a protective sheet and press so because this is regular sublimation it does require a little bit of a warmer press and a little bit of a longer press time once again check out our website for all of those instructions all right so I'm gonna remove my image we're gonna let that cool and we're gonna check out our results so here you can see the three different techniques that we use to print onto the ez subway vinyl we have the vinyl printed with the EZ subway inks we have it printed with the sub legette HD inks and then we have it printed onto sublimation paper and sublimated onto the vinyl after it's been tacked to the shirt so you can see that the EZ subway inks are a little less vibrant than the sub legette H Dinks when printing directly onto the vinyl now printing on to the sublimation paper is going to give you the crisper more vibrant results but there is an extra step involved in addition to being able to print on the vinyl you can also use the EZ subway inks to print across a large range of substrates here we have it printed on metal so this is the EZ subway inks printed on chroma luxe metal and these are the sub legette HD inks printed on chroma luxe metal you can tell there's a definite difference in vibrance and clarity all right guys I hope that tutorial helped you out a little bit you can see on the table here I have the three that we did with the ink comparisons I have this great piece that we used with the mask you can see all the little pieces stayed right where they need it to be then I have these two which are really cool so for these I just printed on the whole sheet peeled it off the backing press it onto the shirt and printed it these are huge in the industry right now so I hope this has helped you a little bit I hope this can help you break into sublimation to cotton sprite here candy systems happy sublimating [Music]", "IPBM2VF28kA": "have you ever wanted something so badly that you'd be willing to risk everything just for the past few years

about 50 percent longer which makes it stronger and therefore the yarn that you can make from it can be thinner and still performance pima cotton is grown in the u.s. it's grown in Australia and Peru and it's cousin supima cotton grown primarily and you know or only in the United States which is basically pima cotton that's been confirmed as authentic by the supima cotton Council other types of cotton just to mention them in contrast and this has become important later on as we discuss this further Egyptian cotton Turkish cotton actually referred to the origin of the cotton bean from those countries and not necessarily the quality Egyptian cotton which is actually been around going back well cotton goes back to BCE 5000 years Egyptian cotton being established as already a great cotton with a longer fiber length even longer than today's current pima cotton tracing the history of how kheema cotton came about so kind of starts in the 1790s off the coast of South Carolina the Egyptian cotton had already been marked as a target or as a strong competitor for a US versus u.s. cotton so they were trying to develop or grow their own Egyptian cotton in the u.s. the growers through selected cross pollenization cross bred the US and Egyptian cotton which then resulted in a product that they labeled as American Egyptian cotton it was more technically known as Els or extra long staple cotton this development of this cotton continued as they tried to make improvements through the 1800s and by the early 1900's the US Department of Agriculture became involved they grew different varieties on an experimental farm in Arizona located on an Indian Reservation and maintained by the Pima Indians the USDA designated the American Egyptian cotton later on as pima cotton and as to give some credit to the people who worked on it in 1951 the USDA in conjunction with the Pima Indians developed a cotton that had superior properties it was a time where they actually made a big advancement in this work that they were doing and that cotton produced a better yield and this truly is so clear touch and that from that point forward that's when Pima really gained its reputation as a consumer that really is no way for us to if this is truly Pema or not visually it's not apparent although pima cotton should produce a nicer hand feel it's really difficult even say oh this is much nicer than some other cotton you may have the Trust has to come from the supplier where you are buying your product from and or if you're a consumer the branch of mine that this brand this did their due diligence to confirm all the way up the supply chain that the Cotton's origin is in truly in fact Pema or supima or Egyptian or Turkish for that matter anyways we still evaluate t-shirts regardless of the type of fabric for the same things we're gonna look at it for construction we're going to look at it before and wash measurements so we can determine the shrinkage and then we'll sum things up and then as always so stick around alright so we have a nice decorative stitching here in the neckline with some taping to cover up that raw that edge that we would normally get we have a top stitch shoulder seam and that taping does continue across the shoulder so nice construction heat seal label and the neck not a woven label which I really think is important get those labels away from the neck there's no care content in the side team Mac Weldon logo on the back and it does say for daily wear they are along the bottom hem some nice tight stitching throughout on the cover stitch just a nice basic t-shirt it does have flat lock seam on the side team which is very nice to see and adds a little bit of decoration to look of the garment so let's get a couple quick measurements here this is an extra-large by the way so chest forty six and a half forty seven and a half I'm sorry forty six and a half sweep 45 and then center front or the center back lanes so fun the top of the neck to the bottom him thirty inches alright so we'll try it out in the wash and see if it doesn't shrink or how much important things because especially if you're going to fit in the store you're gonna want to know if it's going to shrink on you when you get it home so stick around hold on alright so here we are after wash and as you can see the Carmen came out of the dryer nice and clean no wrinkles very nice our chest is measuring forty three and a half it's about a three-inch shrinkage there let's see the sweet 42 and a half also lost about two and a half inches there and let's see in the length we measured from the back of the neck to the front 28 inches 28 inches we're originally 30 so we did have quite a bit of shrinkage three inches over 45 inches at roughly 7% 6% in the width and two inches in the length also about the same a little bit about 7% so the shrinkage is pretty high in the garment so if you do fit it in the store make sure you buy it a little bit big all right so the Mac well didn't sure - Here I am wearing it this is an extra-large I would say that it's fitting close to meet being like a large not quite an extra-large soft very soft and feel it's lighter weight maybe about a hundred and thirty hundred twenty gsm somewhere and there would be my guess overall performance as well the shrinkage does concern me but you make your decision let me know if

take care", "r51YroAFPds": "as you know we're all being encouraged to wear face masks when we go out and about but what if you can't find them to buy you don't so what do you do there are a lot of sewing tutorials out there including mine showing you how to sew them if you if you know how to sew but what if you don't I'm getting a lot of people asking and wondering what they do if there's a method so I've been trying my I've been looking and trying other tutorials online using bandanas fabric folding no sew stuff and I'm just not liking how they fit they're bulky it's they don't fit around the ears and you have to wear elastic I'm John Howell from you make it simple calm and in this tutorial I'm going to show you how to make this DIY face mask no sewing upcycle t-shirt is all you need and five minutes let's do it the only thing you're going to need is a t-shirt the bigger the better you want it to be at least 16 inches wide and a rotary ruler and cutter if you have one if not you can just use scissors so to square off that bottom piece and flip my t-shirt to the side and just get a square and even cut on the bottom edge [Applause] the next thing we're going to do is just cut to 1 inch strips for the ties for an adult mask I'm going to cut an 8 inch strip for a child's mask 6 inches and then for a teen 7 inches so as you can see I could get another another see how this is an angle I'm just going to quickly wear off the edges there on both sides so this will make two masks two adult masks this is about so this is 17 inches you don't want to go any less than 16 inches so take your strips that you cut for the ties and just cut off the scene these are 20 inches which is plenty you can have the ties be 16 to 19 inches because when we pull them they're even gonna get longer so when you pull these little strips they're going to curl and make some really nice comfortable ties those aside we'll save that other strip for the other mask good I'm going to show you how to make out of sleeve so I'm going to pull it to kind of stretch it and you can see how it's curling to the inside that's where I want my the inside of the mask to be I'll face that up facing up and take a strip and measure about four inches just eyeball it four inches from the edge lay your mask or your strap there and another one on this about four inches in I'm going to fold that over and over again and you can always depending on how wide you want it to be on your face you can adjust that at this point so just make sure they're overlapping a little bit and this is the top of the mask so I'm just going to take the ties and make a knot close to the end as possible and then this will be the top which goes over your nose and these will go behind your head so I'll take the mask and place that just on the rim of my nose put this on top of my head and take the strings that are dangling down at the bottom and just pull and it will cinch it and you just adjust it and cinch some more just adjust it on your head where it feels comfortable and pull it behind your neck and tie it just take a minute to adjust it if you want this to see how nice it's like there's no gap down here it's comfortable on the nose and the cheeks it gathers up nice you have three layers the top layer and the two folds right here and if you really wanted to make this tighter under the chin you just take the grab underneath and pull the fabric in a little bit what you really don't have to do but there we have it the most comfortable mask I have ever worn [Music] take your sleep you cut the straps about four inches from the edge now you're not I'm gonna gather this up a little bit and tuck it in the sleeve it's ready to go on your face so this is the one made from the sleeve hold that over your nose put it over your head take the bottom straps and pull at those and in seriously comfortable mask out of a sleeve or the t-shirt I almost like the one made from the sleeve better there's more layers and I don't know it's comfortable they're both comfortable so get out your t-shirts no excuses don't so you got this make sure you're subscribing to my channel to stay updated on the new things hopefully soon we'll be able to make something fun we'll see you in the next class [Music] [Music] you", "0js62kYPZPY": "okay you already know what's up everybody its King James back another video hey

I'm in the studio I just went to Target and I found these really cute and colorful textile markers from kid made modern and I thought I would try them out with you for the first time on one of Jack's t-shirts let's do it the instructions say to place a piece of paper underneath the drawing area to prevent bleed through so let's do that got a piece of paper a little bit thicker smooth cardstock here and I'm using one of Jack's shirts that he's already worn and you can see that there is already some spots on it which I'm going to attempt to cover up so the shirt has been laundered and he's worn it probably only a couple times it's by American Apparel size twelve to eighteen months let's take a look at these markers says that they're double pointed oh I thought that they would be all in a row like that but they're not okay I think these would be good to play with at first I'm actually a little nervous right now I don't know how it's going to turn out but we're just going to give it a go and I have no idea what I'm going to draw let's just do some fun little shapes or maybe I should do a little scene because this is kind of green right here so maybe I'll do some clouds the reason doing these kind of small strokes is because I think it turns out a little bit better instead of dragging the fabric with me when I'm making the marks that's kind of cool should I color it in see what happens there's got to be a technique to this that I don't know about pretty cute I think I'm going to do a tree right here underneath it there's no brown though hmm that's right I'll do a palm tree yeah we'll just improvise right on palm trees can have great runks right why not let's try the other tip this is the thinner side see if we can color with it so I'm just going to actually take a seat and play around with this and see what happens right so I think it's done I had a lot of fun playing with these markers by kid made modern and they're available at Target and I think that they're special care instructions for washing but I'm planning on putting my 18 month-old in this shirt some time and hopefully taking a picture I think it's really a cute and cool way to spend some time getting artsy with this whole t-shirt and I guess what you could do to is add some detailing to the sleeves or even to the neckline and also to the back but I'm going to just be happy with this for now and put Jack in it and take some photos for you hopefully soon and in case you're wondering the reason the markers go in like this and not like this is because you don't fit that way so I'm going to be putting them back the proper way all right well I hope you enjoyed watching how this t-shirt came together I certainly had fun playing with the markers and I hope to see you soon thanks for watching if you have any suggestions for fun short little videos that I can put together in the studio please comment below I'd love to hear from you", "yxVOts5uY0w": "what's up but it's Rob this is a peril success and I've made almost 50 videos now on this channel and I can't believe I haven't made a video on this topic yet but in this video here I'm gonna talk to you about the best blank t-shirts to use for your startup clothing brand and not only that but I'm gonna offer you even more value because I'm gonna help you find local suppliers in your area that will help you make unique t-shirts with customization this videos gonna be sick stay tuned I want to start out this video by letting you know that I am NOT being paid to give any answers here okay this is my own honest to god advice based on my own experiences and working with clothing brands and using blank t-shirts myself and I also want to point out that choosing a blank t-shirt to go with is a lot like choosing a screen printing company to go with okay it largely depends on where you're located and what's local to you okay so a lot of my answers here are going to be based on what I deal with what's local to me and I'm also gonna at the end help you figure out exactly what's local to you and how to find some more customization options that being said let's jump in here buds alright we're gonna run down this in like a top 5 type thing and number 5 the company that we're working with right now for our t-shirts tanks and hoodies is called HS apparel okay and they're located in Canada specifically in Quebec and the reason why we went with them is because we had really great teachers before and we even had really nice hoodies but a lot of the hoodies actually had their own custom labels sewn in so we couldn't actually make our own custom tags okay so we wanted to not only upper quality but we also wanted to go more custom with all of our clothing ok and as you start up as a beginner you know you sort of just start with whatever you get you print on it you try to sell it and then as you grow as a company you want to become more and more custom more and more unique more and more yourself ok so we went with a chest a pair we'll be right back this is an HS Apparel hoodie right here and as you can see they have a nice little spot where you can print your own tags on it ok i highly recommend h HS apparel this is what one of their hoodies lets like super nice quality okay I've won the out of this and I highly recommend them if you're in the Canada area you have to set up an account with them and you have to they sort of like filter out who they work with so you have to like email them and set up an account but they have really really nice stuff if you're able to go with them and once again I said that my options here are going to be based on what I use for my own clothing company because that's what's local to us and this is what we use now our number four choice is called avid apparel okay and this is who we're switching all of our gear to okay all of our tees all of our tanks all of our hoodies and all of our hats okay are going to be going through avid apparel why because they're closer to us they offer even more customization they're amazing quality and we've actually been able to sit down and have full-blown meetings with them going over exactly what we want to do for a clothing brand now avid apparel is extremely local to us okay and they offer us something amazing because they're only know like 20 minutes away from us we can work with them directly that can handle all of our stuff and we're really in the process of growing from an intermediate brand where we're just really you know growing and doing things to actually becoming an advanced brand where we go full-blown cut and sew and fully custom and make everything you know really really custom okay so we're going with avid apparel at number four now you might be wondering why are they you're number four if you're switching everything over to them well this video is supposed to be for startup clothing brands okay brands that are just starting up and not necessarily this far down the road okay so number four and number five have been our local suppliers the ones that we've really gone to as we've grown but number three two and one are going to be those clothing brands that you can go with for your blank t-shirts if you're just starting out that will give you really really high quality and give you a really really good foundation as a clothing brand as you grow into more custom clothing number three on my list is Bella canvas okay and if you're using Bella canvas I highly recommend ordering samples first get numb to your house looking at them and everything before you order say like fifty or a hundred to print all of your designs on okay don't just look at them online order them check out the samples okay this is because when we've done it we found a bunch of their stuff that we really liked and we found a lot of their stuff that we didn't like okay and we actually use them for our ladies tank tops okay because they're nice and soft and they have a tri-blend feel to them and they're really really high-quality in that regard so I don't think you can really go wrong with Bella canvas I'd just be really careful about which items you decide to go with from Bella canvas number two is anvil how sick does anvil sound anvil sounds like a sick little brand and they are a good little brand okay they make a lot of really high-quality blank t-shirts and we actually use their hoodies for a while but like I said at the beginning of the video a lot of their hoodies have their own labels like stitched directly in you it's really hard to remove those and I don't even notice we necessarily want to remove those because that's all I complicated it takes more time but they have really nice quality stuff okay so if you're not really worried about the labels for the hoodies and if you really want some high quality t-shirts I highly recommend going with anvil for your blank t-shirts now number one on my list buds if you're just starting up as a clothing brand who wants a really really high quality tea that's inexpensive is all style okay we used all style when we first started up for all of our t-shirts and all of our tank tops and they were absolutely incredible okay we never got any bad reviews on the quality of our tees and they were super inexpensive for us and they were just a really really good option for us to start out with so that we you know could grow forward and not spend a lot of money where we still had some options making lightweight heavy weight you know a bunch of different colors it's just a really good option if you're first starting out okay so I highly recommend all style so those are my top five picks for blank clothing to use for your clothing brand and like I said a lot of that has to do with where I'm located and what's close to me and what's an option for me in Canada if you're in Australia you might have different suppliers that are local to you that are even better than what we have to offer here okay so what I also highly recommend doing whether you're just starting up or whether you're deep into this is doing some research on Google okay and I highly recommend using the keywords wholesale blank t-shirts Canada or wholesale clothing Australia or wherever you're located find these local brands okay because a lot of these local brands are actually really really sweet and offer a really high quality stuff and if you set up a meeting with them you find out their prices they might be able to actually get you into more customization and you can work with them and build a brand that is completely unique off of something that's local to you okay so I highly recommend doing that otherwise use some of those options that I offered you in this video I think that you can't go wrong now I realize that this video is about blank t-shirts and has absolutely nothing to do with marketing but I've created an online course called Instagram marketing for clothing brands that's coming out on March 13th and there's a link of the description below if you're interested follow that link check out a video I got a little waitlist going and I actually have a special offer that's going to be going on for the first 10 days if you're interested I want to tell you about the closed Facebook group that we have going on for apparel success there's a link in the description below follow the link where a bunch of clothing brand owners all in there to support each other and answer each other's questions thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next one peace [Music]", "TG98lCVM6uU": "[Music] what's up YouTube welcome back to end living other how are you living today so we brought you guys a new DIY featuring portrait tees and we hope you guys like them if you have an array we are on our way to 2,000 subscribers so go ahead and hit the subscribe button below and don't forget to hit the bell so that way you get notifications for all of our new uploads we got inspired to do this DIY from the brand supreme and you guys know supreme is very popular for their street wear and also very popular for their box logo tease as well as their portrait photo tease they have been releasing those since 2005 so they had the current photo tee they had a distant one they had a Gucci bang last one and most recently they have this shot a portrait tee so us being frugal but still trying to be very trending we decided to come up with our own to save a little money and to show you guys how we did it and some of the do's and the don'ts as well so let's just go ahead and get into the DIY so pretty much we went to our local Goodwill and picked out some t-shirts some long sue shirts and some sweatshirts we tried not to spend over two to three dollars for the shirts and then around $5 for the sweatshirt just because if it cost more than that you shouldn't be buying it at a third store exactly I think our total was about twenty dollars and we got about six yeah about six well six years pretty much these are the teeth that we went out and thirsted at our local Goodwill we try not to spend over $3 per te or $5 per sweatshirt but you can see those here they're very plain and we pretty much purchased them to fit within our style so one thing you also want to make sure you do is make sure that you fully wash and dry your t-shirts especially if you search them you want to make sure that you put them in the washer and dryer first with the transfer paper that we purchased from Avery you do have to wait 24 hours before you can wash and dry the clothes again though the paper we purchase pretty much on Amazon he should actually got it if you guys have seen our using lookbook video you haven't seen that video go ahead and click the link to watch it here and then we have some leftover paper we did only have three sheets left so we have to get a little creative once we figured out which images we wanted to use for each shirt we took those images and we went on an application a website called canva comm the link will be below and we pretty much went fair and serve our images and resize them to our liking and then from there we went ahead and printed them out and then placed them kind of where we wanted to place them before we went ahead and iron them onto the shirt so let's just jump right into the details on how to do the portrait tees what you're going to need is a printer some scissors or an exacto knife and iron and of course your transfer paper and if you have any t-shirts wear hoodies jackets whatever you pretty much want the custom pictures to be on you're going to need that as well we will be sure to put a link below for everything that we used for the DIY including the type of transfer paper we use although there are multiple different brands out there I think we just kind of picked the cheapest one some other items you want to make sure you have is a pillowcase and you also want to make sure you are ironing on a hard surface so like a wooden surface from my three shirts you guys I chose Cullis because I don't know if you guys know he is my favorite rapper of all time second I chose Lauryn Hill she inspired me ever since I was little and then third I chose Rihanna because why not it's Rihanna she looked hot on screen on camera on TV why not she probably looking too hot or on a shirt so those are my three two of my shirts they're going to be featuring I'll leave just because I'm always dressing up as her for Halloween and of course I always like the 90 style so I just kind of want to talk to share it's dedicated to her and for my third shirt is a dedication shirt too though Isabella province and her mother Lisa Sunday because they are both pulling and they're both bet once you have the designs kind of place where you want them you can go ahead and download your image off your computer and start printing and so one thing that we had to test out before we print it was how to put the paper in correctly so that it printed on the right side our tips and our pro tips to you guys is to put the Avery or whatever transfer paper that you're using there should be like little design logos on one side put that facing front up into your printer and then that will ensure that everything gets printed correctly and on the right side they do actually in most transfer paper packages give you a test page that you can try and print on so go ahead and use that as well I want to make sure you're using some type of easiet once you have your images printed now you want to go ahead and cut them out we laid out each t-shirt we cut out the portraits the way that we wanted them to sit like I said we only had about 30 sheets left so we did have to get a little bit creative you have everything cut out and you have it laid out on your t-shirt the way that you want and you're pretty sure about how you want it to stay if you want to make sure that your portrait is perfectly Center you can actually use a chalk pencil to make sure everything is in line we kind of just wanted to throw everything up there we knew it was going to come out looking good anyway so we just put our stuff up there and moved on with the next step now you wanna move on to next step which is unpeeling the sticky side of the transfer paper and when you're doing this stuff you want to be very very careful please please please please please make sure you take the backing off before you start ironing it on let's see she went ahead and ironed I think it was Rihanna she started ironing Rihanna on before she pulled the back off and so Rihanna was stuck to the paper a little bit so it's just a little bit longer for us to actually peel that transfer paper off so just make sure you have it peeled off beforehand and the edges might curl up a bit after you have peeled the paper paper backing off so just make sure you're holding it down when you reach the next step now that you have your backing paper off go ahead and place your image on your shirt with the design facing up and then from there you want to grab your tissue paper which should be included with your transfer package but you want to get that tissue paper and place it right on top to get ready to iron it one thing you want to pay attention to or any direction that your transfer paper comes with hours for examples that make sure that you don't use the steam setting all steam settings should be turned off on your iron it should be on the cotton setting for the heat as well as make sure there is no water in your iron because that is going to drip and it's going to cause bubbling and that it's not going to look good at this point your layers should be pretty much your hard surface a pillowcase your t-shirt your transfer paper and on top of that you should have your tissue paper and you are all set to iron again ironing from left to right and then from top to bottom you want to make sure you are pressing firm on there but you don't want to hold you I earn in one spot for too long you want to kind of keep it moving at a consistent speed left to right top to bottom and nice and firm and if your edges start to curl up when your insurance or paper just lifts the tissue paper up a little bit and try and hold them down and iron as you go most likely they will fold back down and stick back to the shirt but if you can't get them to stick down it's not the end of the world sometimes it ends up looking good so I ended up actually burning one of my shirt right across a Leo's forehead I might turn my tissue paper slipped a little bit so I ended up burning it but it still looks kind of cool because it makes it look a little bit older so I kind of just started distressing another part of the portrait just to kind of make it seem like it was on purpose you can always buy a new t-shirt and of course the transfer paper is not that expensive so that is the benefit of this DIY you don't want to stay ironing on your t-shirt for probably about two to three minutes at a time just making sure all of the edges are firmly down you're going to want to let the t-shirt cool for about 30 seconds before listing with tissue paper up off and peeling it slowly off the t-shirt if your edges or your corners start coming up when you're feeling the tissue paper just fold it back down and iron over it and wait a few more seconds for it to cold once you take the tissue paper off you want to lay the shirt out somewhere lay it out nice and flat and let it cool off for at least two to three minutes now that we are done with our DIY we are going to go ahead and take these t-shirts and throw them on and scale them for you guys to give you a quick look of how they turned out and if you guys haven't already go ahead and hit that subscribe button if you have any comments

I'm now in the kitchen getting cooking no but for real though we bout to boil t-shirts so I'm gonna show you guys how to shrink these bad boys it's a very quick process but it's definitely worth the watch so if you're interested in learning how to shrink extra-large t-shirt stay tuned guys so I am in my kitchen I have filled up this pot with just cold water and I am going to move the camera so you can see where I'm going but we're going to put this on a stove which is already on like medium to high heat during the top on that bad boy you'll need a spoon or some tongs or something to like actually put the shirt into the water and like put it down in there but these are the shirt that I'm going to use for demonstration purposes because I'm actually wearing them in a shoot today so you'll see me make them small and you'll be able to see me actually wear them because I do this quite often in a lot of times people don't believe him I'm like yeah this was actually like three times too big and I shrunk it down but I think that a lot because I always have to make my clothes work for me so you know it just is what it is but I do like to be able to share the secrets because then you can stop shying away from buying all the things you want when you're out you can just get what you like and then figure out the rest later spin that coin says actually don't because we're quarantined because the world is ending so yep but anyway first shirt to go into this toe into zip box is going to be the Metallica shirt now if Fisher is a hundred percent cotton or polyester or whenever this shirt it needs to be made out of cotton or polyester in order for you to be able to actually shrink because the heat when you boil it is actually like sure the cotton and so yeah that's how that works so boiling it it's almost like when you watch something in the washing machine with hot water and you didn't mean to shrink it yes well this time we're doing it on purpose so we're just going to leave that here leave it on the stove for like five to ten minutes or until it starts to boil sometimes with the top will start to let lift up or you'll just be able to hear it steaming when it starts to do that we'll come back and I'll show you what to do stay tuned okay guys so I'm back and I'm also a dressed for my shoot I decided to go ahead and put my first outfit of the day on for my actual photo shoot so you guys could see what the shrunken clothes look like after you put them on so just so happens I also shrink these pants that I'm wearing so you guys can see but initially when I got these pants they were gapping in the waist in the back and now I don't have that problem so I Shrunk the pants and they're just polyester I got them from Target and then the Metallica shirt which I bought in a size large and shrunk down to like a large and a half like a medium and a half I don't know but yeah so the last shirt is the shirt with the picture of the picture on it and the guys so I wanted to come back and kind of show you guys what the sizing difference looks like at the end because I want you to think that you can shrink a size extra large shirt so size extra small it doesn't shrink that much but it does shrink it to where it's acute size shirt so depending on whether you buy a medium or a large or an extra-large will let you know how much the size difference will be after you shrink it so this is what the sleeve difference looks like and then also at the bottom you can see that the Tupac shirt is just much longer than the shirt that I shrunk and so it was just fitting more comfortably and it'll you like a little bit easier to style because it won't be that big if it make sense so enjoy this video please like comment and subscribe and let me know if you guys want garment care video about how to wash and care for garments to avoid shrinking them because we don't want to shrink everything some things need to stay the same so let me know and I'll see you guys in the next video peace", "D6fFLGW-0HE": "[Music] in today's tutorial I want to show you three easy ways to DIY your vintage t-shirts the first thing you'll need is obviously a t-shirt turn your t-shirt inside out and lay it on the flat surface use a pen to draw a triangle just under the neckline if your t-shirt has a print it's best if you measure out the triangle before cutting it to make sure it's right in the middle then just start cutting out the triangle you can start by cutting out a smaller triangle and then after you try it on you can decide if you want a bigger one [Music] [Music] I cut the sleeves halfway and tied a double knot at the ends in order for them to be a bit tighter on the arms [Music] for the next DIY I'm going to use an old vintage t-shirt turn your t-shirt inside out once again and draw a curved line from the neckline to the sleeves [Music] now cut along the lines you just drew [Music] for the last DIY I use the plain black t-shirt turn your t-shirt inside out and draw three lines just under your neckline pinch the fabric with your scissors and make sure you don't cut the back of your t-shirt now cut along the lines you just created it's easier to work with a thicker fabric my t-shirt was very thin so I had a hard time making sure the cuts are neat [Music] I've also decided to cut out the shoulders just like I did for the previous t-shirt [Music] to make it look more distress I've added another three cuts at the side of the t-shirt right at the bottom [Music] [Music] I hope you enjoyed this DIY and don't forget to come back next week for a new one [Music]", "PNUdm8nOXwM": "Oh what up everybody since I'm excited I get this mineral wash effect on a t-shirt t-shirt t-shirt t-shirt t-shirt t-shirt t-shirt t-shirt t-shirt t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t [Music] so I took the black shirt that I wanted to use and test it out bleach on and I didn't like how yellow it got the things so instead I'm actually used this water-based ink for screen printing I just put in a little container and added water and then got to consistency kind of like milk noise next I get my shirt I'm just using an old shirt of mine and the hard surface I can put inside the shirt I put some spray adhesive so that will hold still this will make it easier to get that mineral wash effect so then I just take four kind of round pebbles so that's before just some round pebbles put in that little mixture I rub around my hand and brother on the shirt every so often I'll take like another pebble and I'll put it back in the inking and I'll use that to get all the rest of the rocks ready to rub again on a shirt so rotate a shirt and rub the rocks on it until it's all over your shirt took a hot second hardest part was getting on the sleeves after you get all done how you like it you're going to want to heat set that ink so what I use is an iron now if you have a logo on the shirt what you're gonna want to do is put some teflon paper down this will protect your image because if the iron touches the design you'll probably burn that on to the iron so after that I threw it in the other like I did on my t-shirt video and then I washed and dried it well after I washed and dried it I wasn't too happy with how how much it faded so I did it begin this time I made a little bit bigger so the white would be a little more drastic and after ironing and putting it through the oven washing dry it turned out pretty cool pretty cool I was happy with it it'd be pretty cool to see um if you guys do this with bleach how it turns out maybe do it on something like a jean jacket or some jeans it could be real rad I'd love to see it so if you guys want to follow me I'll be cool I have some pretty exciting stuff I'm going to be releasing here a little bit and also some exciting news so you can get think on that tooth back", "I9OjXQJ5GyE": "hello guys II spoke today I would like to show you a quick very quick video about the one of the alternative how to preen how can you print dark garments with sublimation so as you know sublimation works on the white and light garments and fabrics or items but there is a way there is a couple ways of printing on a dark so you can you can use the transfer obviously you know sublimation sublimation but then but you can use the glitter but not everyone want to use the glitter on items because now everyone want to have the garment sparkling so here is something that is called so blue flock you probably heard about this this is my comm tech should avail but card I would say and you can sublimate on it so the most common thing that people do is bring their logos on transfer sheets and then they sandwich the sub leaf log sheets like this and they press it this is the most common way I'm not a big fan of it I show you how to do a better is a short cut you miss one you will miss one step but is much much better in my opinion so first of all I'll show you how to do it the old way so is the way you sandwich the prints so I was right so check this out the velvet side up and the printer sheets down protection paper and this is the standard way that you get you see a lot on the YouTube or elsewhere by the suppliers that's a 50 seconds 480 centigrade so when is it times up you should see the finished product he moved so here we go this is the finished product now you can slice this in the pits now it's very hard it's quite cardboard because we already press there any any sir not Steve but he's not as nice as it was before printing so now I'll show you that my way of doing it so we're going to skip the sandwiching products so I am by my printer now and what I do and I'm taking an a4 sube sube flock sheets and I print directly on it so just need to open the open the printer and load as you would normally with you submit the sublimation paper make sure is nice and snug oh so now we're just on the computer and the printer should start printing directly on the sub leaflet this is not something that you will see on any any videos because not many people doing it I'm not sure why in my opinion this is much better way of printing because you were skipping one one step which is completely unnecessary because you can print directly on the flog because these are fluffy it has a texture so ink stays lovely on it dry or instantly and the color will pop after you press the logo on the garment anyway so you doing it much quicker in much better way in my opinion of us me if you don't if you disagree with it recover better that's a way just let me let me know down the car down below of red lights on I think the time to change some things here we go so here is the logo directly on the shades okay so this is a this is a finished yes so now we just need to you can if you have an interact design different shapes you can use obviously your cutter to cut it into the shape this is just a simple shape so I'm gonna use my blade to cut it okay so here is the logo we can now apply the logo to the black t-shirt hey how the tissues ready in here this is some random lady feet cotton pre-press [Music] okay to remove the moisture and now you notice the sue brief LOC as a protective layer is a protective paper which you can peel off is quite tricky when you're looking into the camera here we go it's like a sticker and that's what the glue appears a shiny shiny glow so here we go let's try to press on so those colors should be more vivid after you press the products paper and we're gonna give it a bash for 50 seconds only 10 to 10 seconds left now hey Joe this is ready so bleep flock on the dog government which I will zoom in to show you a little bit movement here we go you know as you can see how vivid it looks compared to unpressed vinyl it's much much more juicy colors and more vivid so this is one I think and is much much much softer so here we go this is my way of printing onsubmit", "Xu4FmTNq62g": "the guild in 2000 ultra cotton tea

how to bleach a sweatshirt for christmas this is one of my popular designs it's very simple it's very easy it doesn't take too much work first off we're going to start with a walmart time and true sweatshirt these particular ones are 7.8 cents they're usually on a shelf in boxes along with sweatpants that match them so just kind of help you guys find where they are i did have a little bit trouble trying to find more of these red ones in particular in my area but you might have a better luck than i did so one of the things we're going to need is bleach i usually put mine in old spray bottles eventually the bleach will eat through the bottle up so you may have to change these every once in a while but one of the most important things to do is do not use old bleach when doing your sweatshirts i learned that the hard way bleach does go bad so try to use um good fresh bleach i just bought the dollar general brand and it works perfectly you don't need to spend a lot of money and also don't do these splash lists another thing we need is hydrogen peroxide i actually have mine in a peroxide spray bottle so there's no confusion you should find these in with the regular bottles and then i just refill it as needed and then this is going to be our sub that's going to go on our sweatshirt once it's bleached i got this particular design at red rocks designs i'll post the link in the description where you can purchase this file and last but not least what a lot of people would ask me is how do i do the flowers i actually use these rubber vinyl placemats usually you can find them in the seasonal sections like for christmas where all the christmas decorations and stuff are or you can find them in the kitchen stuff with regular placemats these ones i've actually bought at ross i have two different designs one of the main reasons why i like using these is because they're reusable once i'm done i just wash them off and they're good to go for another one so first what we're going to do with all this is i'm going to lay my vinyl designs where i would like them [Music] just like that make sure you guys can see what i'm doing [Music] so now that we've got our our vinyl placements where we like them we're going to go ahead and take our spray bottle and we're just going to lightly mist the design and i do my candy cane lines i just slowly squeeze the bottle and run it down the area a couple times let me give you a nice candy cane stripe all right and as for the section of our word it's gonna go i usually take mine and kind of measure out where i'm gonna put it just so i can reach just that particular spot and then all you gotta do now is play the waiting game and let it sit while it [Music] releases [Music] all right guys now that you can see after our bleach is sitting in here for maybe about five to ten minutes it's gotten pretty white these sweatshirts do generally bleach really well like i said it's very important that you use a fresher bleach to help you out but now that it has changed to white and we don't want it the bleach to do anything else we're going to go ahead and take our peroxide and we're going to spray our bleach areas what this does is neutralizes the bleach so it won't eat the fabric and now that we have our bleach sprayed and neutralized what we're going to do is we're actually going to toss this in the washer and run it on a cold cycle to help rinse out any extra bleach and then we're going to go ahead and dry it before we sew [Music] you", "M0pSYfKd4KI": "1 EINAUDI New Fashion Marvel Short Sleeve T shirt Men

your first time visiting thank you so much for watching my video and giving it a shot i hope you enjoy the content if you do please remember to like the video subscribe to my channel and also share the video for anyone who may benefit from it all right today we are going to be sublimating on this black shirt well kinda so when you hear people telling you that you can sublimate on black shirts or you can sublimate on cotton shirts because this is black and cotton and in the world of sublimation that is a no-go but what we are going to be doing is we are going to sublimate onto this glitter htv and that will be sublimate that will be pressed not sublimated but that will be pressed onto this black shirt another way to sublimate onto black or cotton is to um use easy subly by sizer and you'll be able to it's pretty much the same process you will print or you'll print your um image you will sublimate it onto the easy subli and then you will press it onto the shirt i will do a video um showing that also but today we are using the glitter htv okay so let's get started all right so today we are going to be designing in illustrator and before we get started i want to let you all know that i already pressed this shirt to get out any moisture and the wrinkles and prior to me printing out the design i usually measure the area that i am going to be using so um we are about i think i may be doing maybe a little bit less than an 11 by probably seven because i really just want it in this this area here okay so for that we'll need to print on an eight and a half by eleven all right so we are getting ready to design well i've already purchased a design from designbundles.net so we won't be making any um designs it's already made for us okay we are now in illustrator and we are just going to place our image inside of the program okay so it comes in a lot larger than we really want it to be so we are just i'm going to update the side size okay let's see if we can find it i'm going to smaller okay there we have it okay so i'm just going to make this a little bit larger so that we can see it okay all right so what i want to do is i want to remove some of the white space around so that i can get a true size so i'm just going to crop the image a bit okay all right so once i'm done with this what i want to do next is i do want to make it a little bit larger so i'm going to make it a ten and a half by let's see a six because it's still within the measurements that i wanted so that's perfect and i'm using this size paper so that we don't waste the 13 by 19 and flipping it as you guys can see we're uh doing it landscape or the orientation is landscape so that we can have a wider picture print out so if you ever if you only have a printer that can print eight and a half by elevens uh remember or eight and a half by fourteens to get it wider just flip the orientation and then you can have um a little bit wider a wider range to print or to design too okay so what i want to do is i want to have a black background because the shirt is black so i'm just going to make a rectangle here and i'm going to have black make it black and i do want to resize it but what i want to do is i want to get a very black um rectangle so i am just going to input the percentages of the color that i want here what you can do is if you want a specific color you can actually look that color up online and simply just put that you're looking for um the cmyk of a particular color and it will get you what you need okay okay so i just need to resize that because i wanted to have kind of a perfect um fit with the background i don't want too much glitter going beyond the actual image so we resized it to a ten and a half by five and now all we need to do is send it to the back okay and there is our image we are just going to bring it down just a little bit remember you want all of your image onto the glitter um htv because if not it will not print on your black shirt okay or you won't be able to see it and this looks good and i am ready to print so i'm going to go up here to print and you see you can kind of gauge it and see how it's printing here and i do have some a little bit over beyond the margin so what i'm going to do is i'm just going to have or do borderless printing okay so i'm going to go to setup today i am going to print from the epson um ecotank 2750 let's look what the default settings are [Music] we will go to print settings everything is exactly how i want it borderless is selected already so color options the the program is managing the color that's exactly what i want okay and the profile that i'm using is the epson ij printer07 okay sometimes i use this one it depends but for today that's what we're going to use and it looks like the settings are exactly what i want so i can just go it's mirrored always make sure that you're marrying your image i'm printing on high quality paper media is the premium presentation mat um you you have to test your own print settings sometimes because what works for me may not work for you um so just test it out all right and we're ready to print all right guys so as our printer prints our image we are going to cut our htv and we need to measure it because we know that we're doing a ten and a half by six so we just want to make sure that we measure it and we cut it to be precise all right so our image has completed printing and just want to let it dry a little bit i don't know what got held up in the printer but it's all good okay so now i'm just going to cut around the edge of the image so that we can get ready to line that up on to the htv glitter alright guys so we are ready to press our image onto our shirts and what we're going to do first is i like to measure the the distance from the neckline so you want to give it about three inches or so and then we want to make sure that it is centered okay and so to do that i am going to measure each side so that's about four inches on that side and a little less than four inches so maybe move it just slightly over and we should be good okay [Music] so i'm going to press this it's already on 400 so i'm just gonna press it for like 10 seconds that'll be enough because we're going to have to re-press it again anyway all right that's 10 seconds and now what we want to do is we want to move the plastic or the protective layer off of the glitter so just find it there it is voila [Music] all right guys next we need to place our image on top of the glitter and always make sure you're putting it on the right side and it's not upside down so we're just going to simply place this on top and we want to try to cover all the white because we don't really want any of that white showing [Music] and i'm just going to use a little bit of heat tape just to tape it down so that it doesn't shift that is optional be very careful if you don't have a drawer or pull drawer all right we are ready to press our shirt and it's going to press for 60 seconds [Music] all right guys so we are done pressing our image is very hot okay and this is what we have i could have made sure to kind of cover the white a little bit better at the top but this is all set all right so we're all done sublimating onto a black cotton t-shirt and this is our final product and just to recap we actually sublimated onto white glitter htv and we printed out our image we put the glitter backing onto the shirt first and then we pressed the image on top of the glitter and that is one way of sublimating onto a black t-shirt okay the colors look good what i don't like about this particular shirt is the white border around i want it to cover as much as possible but i see in the bottom a little of the ink um there so i should have just adjusted a little bit but i was in a rush but this shirt is still wearable um yeah that's it i do wish this was a png file had i created this file myself i probably would have made the word blessed teacher in white but i still like it and i i think it's going to be cute for me to wear to um school or on our virtual meetings all right y'all that's about it thank you so much for watching this video if you

complete a big basket like this I'm using this cotton sash cord that I got from a local hardware store but you can certainly buy it online and I'll give you some suggestions for some supplies and that will be in the description box below this video this particular one is quarter-inch you'll want quarter-inch for sure this one comes on a hundred foot rule or thirty point four meters so you'll be needing two of those so in total you'll need two hundred feet or sixty point eight meters this is the cotton sash cord multi-purpose depending on how much strengthen you alter different colored fabric you want could be between a half a meter to a meter of fabric I probably only use I'd say maybe about half a meter to do these two stripes you'll be wanting to cut one inch fabric strips cut on the bias I'm using broad cloth but you can use 100% cotton I'm using only this because I had it on hand and I wanted black if you don't know how to cut fabric on the bias then I'll leave a link to that video so you can learn how to cut fabric on the bias you'll want a tape measure scissors pins lots of thread in the color of choice I chose to use black and you need at least four round bobbins to make the size of baskets it's handy to have some clips I picked up these from the dollar store and I like these ones because they've got a nice wide edge that goes way too long for the ropes it's I did put three of these wooden beads to finish off my basket you don't have to have these but look for ones with a really big hole so you can get a large rope through here if you want the same kind of beads I'll leave the link in the description box below for you if you choose to want to unravel your cord at the end then you can use a peso like this I got this one at Walmart or just use a regular hair comb and of course you're gonna need a sewing machine [Music] you don't want weight pulling on your rope because it can cause uneven surface and you want it to be nice and flat so I like to unravel my skein of rope and then I roll it up into a ball and the first thing I like to do is I like to tape my rappelled in because it's much easier to have that all together when you're trying to form your first part of your circle because as you can see you're gonna get these little loose ends flying all over the place I've just got a piece of scotch tape and I'll wrap that around I'm going to end and then I'm just going to feel if my nail where the end is sometimes it's hard to see I'm only gonna leave a very very small amount on there there's the end there and I'm gonna cut most of it off just enough to hold those ends in place and this is how I start all of my rope pulls we're just going to make a really tight round on that first part nice and tight and let's go around for about four rounds [Music] keeping it nice and snug and tight all right so much here bear trap your pins and just hold it in place so it stays there while we go to the sway machine [Music] and with a straight stitch on the sewing machine I'm going to sew through this way and then through the other way so let's start on the end and back stitch and all the way through and when you get to the middle here just to reinforce that middle a bit I like to backspace and just a little bit more in the middle into the end and back space back stitch I don't know how many times I say that getting old so we'll take that off and we're going to come through the other way [Music] [Music] you might have noticed I have some Ford's to the side here and I do this because I don't have a quilting extended bed or tray whatever you want to call it and so you want to keep this part of your base flat as it works further further out it's got to be flat otherwise your bottom of your bowl or basket is going to start to curve up so I've just grabbed some wood panels and some books paper or whatever it takes until you've got a nice little edge now we're finished with our straight stitch we're going to move on and change it to a zigzag now if you've watched other Roble videos of mine please feel free to fast forward on these because it is the same for all my row bowls but for those who have not made a row bowl before this is what I do for my whip it's always at my widest selection so for me it's sitting at 5.5 for my length I like to set it at 4 I don't want it my zigzags too long and I don't want them too short so I find 4 is just about perfect now when you start sewing you want your cord coming off the right side and you want your bowl or basket forming to the left so always with your cord to the right I'm going to come in and I'm going to start to bring this together on the second and third row because we've done the X in here that's going to hold this part of the bowl quite firmly so I'm just going to go with my second and third row now what I line up my presser foot and my rope ball I'm lining it up so the center of the break in my presser foot is in the center of the two ropes and I use that to eyeball on the whole basket so on the first part you're gonna have to go a little bit slower just to get around if it's a very small circle so let's just start the first one and of course the doc speaks and now we're on our way and now on the first part I only go about two stitches lift up my presser foot and the needle is always on the right angle it around do one more angle it around and don't worry about this starting to wrap around we won't slow that in we'll see what we do in a second here again always keep that needle on the right if you're going to pivot up and around needles on the right and continue around [Music] [Music] so once you've got your first few rows done feel free to go a little bit faster when you get more comfortable with it so now instead of lifting up the presser foot and pivoting I'm going to use my fingers to pull it around like so you can lift up the presser foot and just let that wrap around till this is coming down to the front and now we're going to leave this coming down to the front and we can go a little bit faster now [Music] I'm holding the cord in my thumb and making sure that this is not tight and it's nice and loose coming off my ball and my fingers is guiding the Rope a little bit and I'm pulling it around with my fingers [Music] I'm watching really carefully that the break in my presser foot is right in the middle of these two ropes as I saw [Music] so continue on and keep sewing until this is a little bit bigger now I'm ready to add a little bit of black to my rope so I've got stripes on the bottom of my basket as well this is where the dollar store clips will come in handy and I'm going to start my wrap on the bottom here because what I find is when these are both hanging straight down you don't have to be like flicking this up and over every time and it goes a little faster so for now we're just gonna go straight like so I'm going to tuck this end in so it's nice and secure on that first part of that wrap we're just tucking in that little corner once we've got that nice and secure then we can start to angle it down so make sure your first two rounds are nice and tight and then we're on our way so now I'm only wrapping and covering half of this inch so half an inch of this is getting covered I'm at the end of my rapping so I'm just going to hear that with my little clip and then I can continue to sew [Music] I just want a little bit of accent of black on the very bottom so buy one piece of black material is going to end rate where I almost started so that's enough for me so it's going to keep selling take our clip off I like to tuck that little point underneath to hide it and then bring it in so my hand holds it together [Music] second I'm going to continue sewing just lift plain rope with no more black and I'm going to probably make my face approximately 12 inches or that would be approximately 31 30 31 centimeters it's all to continue to sell here I've just realized I've run out of bobbin thread and so I'm just gonna take this off the sewing machine rewind my bobbin and start sewing again I've got my bobbin rewound and I'm gonna come back in I'm gonna try to match up and bring my needle down right to where one of my points on my zigzag is so when I back stitch on this it's not gonna look like a bit of a mess it'll just help to look it make it look a little bit cleaner so there I go I've matched that up presser foot down and we're going to back stitch and away we go and now a little skinny a bit bigger instead of using my hand in the middle I'm bringing my baby finger on to the edge here and that's what's helping me to guide it around my little baby finger here isn't pushing in really tight I'm not pulling on this but just enough to just slightly guide it into the other rope here [Music] and I met my table inches I think that'll be a pretty good base for a nice little bin basket or that would be about thirty point five centimeters so now we're gonna start forming our sides I'm going to be bringing my hand underneath my base and lifting it all the way up so it's sitting flat against my sewing machine like so and then we'll continue sewing around before I start adding my black what I'm doing is I really want to make sure this is a nice straight side and I'm accenting this just slightly by putting my hand underneath and not just holding to the side of my machine here but I'm lifting up like so so therefore the angle is forcing this rope to be just slightly inward so I get a nice straight side otherwise I fight on the larger baskets it'll start to come out a little bit and I don't want that so just a little trick there so I'm going to lift up and so like bad [Music] and keep sawing until you've got the amount that you want for the depth before you add your first color now that I've made sure that my sides are forming straight up I'm going to start adding my collar now which is black already pre round some black on my cord so I can carry on now and now I won't need to lift it up anymore I'm going to just do some straight sewing and make sure this is nice and flat and I'll use my fingers in here to hold it flat as I sew so around we go adding more strips of fabric is easy enough to do just take off your last clip bring on the next one and then make sure your little and on your last one is tucked in bring this one and pull that little ending on the last one now bring in your little point in catch it in there and wrap around and away we go again first one will be on the tighter side and then you can start to drag it down so you're only covering a half of your material as before so if you're making a large basket like I'm inking I've now used up 100 feet of that one skein and now it has to add another one so this is a great time to add it if you've got just a little bit more of your fabric strip left and you're at the end of your rope and the easiest way is just to grab your next rope and tape the two together and you'll have your material hiding it and nobody will know the difference that you've got you got tape in there so let's grab a piece of tape we'll start on the rope I've got right here let's start to add the next one and we're just going to squish them together and get that tape wrapped around both of them and I'm pushing them together quite tightly so there's no gap and I'll continue to wrap my fabric around my tape portion and that will hold it nice and secure and we'll sew right through the join what I'm doing now as I'm sewing is I'm holding my fingers up here and my arm is kind of resting on the backside of the basket and I'm holding it up as I so it's a little easier couldn't fluffing around and you can't see what you're doing with your hip with the basket in the way so just giving it some support with your fingers and sole away when you wrap your rope with material it will make your best a lot firmer then the rope that's not wrapped also the 100% cotton will also give you more stiffness for your basket I'm using the broad cloth so not quite as stiff but it's certainly helping to give it a firm basket so I'll carry on I'm going to sew a few more rows of black and then I'm gonna go back to just sewing just with the same rope so this is as far as I'm going to go with my black and now I'm going to carry on and do some more rows of just with the plain rope with the basket getting bigger I like to hold it up at the top and then when I'm sewing [Music] this comes around [Music] I only want to use two skeins of this rope because that would be like 200 feet so I want to make sure I've got enough left over for my handles so I'm taking the end of my rope I'm gonna wrap it around my basket so I'm just wrapping it around once here just to get my measurement I'm allowing a little bit more for my handle to come out and go out so let's say it's about here so I've got my measurement there now I'm going to do that three more times I'm just taking my rope and I measure about three more times because I want my handle to be three widths of the rope thick and then allowing for a loop on the handle again and I've placed a clip and that's when I have to start my handles so I'm gonna come back in it add some more of my black fabric whines the sauna and start sewing again and I'm finishing up with my black and then I will continue on in me just the plain rope with no fabric I'm getting close to where I've made my mark that's where I'm going to start my handles this is the amount of cord we've left so we've got room to do three rounds of a handle so I'm going to backstitch and take it off this way machine [Music] look at that lovely big basket that beautiful now we want to place pins so we know where we're going to put our handles here's the end of my cord I'm going to estimate that this is where I'm going to place my handle right here so this is going to be the middle of my handle so what I'm gonna do is it gonna just squish in my basket like so follow it along and I know that this is going to be the middle of my handle on this side and squish it along and I know this is the middle onto this end from where my rope ended and where I placed the middle of my handle marker that was two and a half inches or about seven centimeters so let's make a mark on the other side again at two and a half inches placing my marker there so I know that I'll end it here but we need a little bit of loop in here so what I'm going to do is at this point I'm going to measure another two and a half inches place my finger there and that is where I'm going to place my hand will seem to bring that back and that's where it's going to sit right there and that's where I'm going to place my handle and this is going to come around we're going to sew around and we're going to do the same thing on the other side here so we'll just estimate that when we sew around this is where I placed the middle of my handle so I want to mark two and a half that's my first part of the handle and on this end another two and a half on the other side and I'll place a marker we'll take this middle one out just so it doesn't confuse us I've placed my need a little bit further back from where I started and I'm going to backspace just to give it a little bit more support so we've got strength at the beginning of our handle here so I'll just go back a bit forward back and forward now what we're going to be doing is we're going to sew along this top part here we're not sewing out to the top of the handle at this point in time we're going to grab it on our next round so what you want to do is angle your basket so you're only sewing into this last row and get it back again so you're stitching straight can take out that pin we're going to sell up to this point here as soon as you get to the close to the pin we're going to lift the presser foot push your rope up tight we're going to press the foot down remove your pin now we're going to grab these two and so long just to make sure I'm going to just use the end of my scissors here just to make sure that stays in nice and tight just enough to grab it once you've got it grabbed we'll just do a couple more stitches and then back stitch forward back stitch and forward now we're going to sew along till we get to our next pin [Music] oh not a good time to run out of often thread so I've gotta take this out well be careful of that and we'll have to remeasure that again and we'll do that again and I will be wined my bobbin not a good time to run out is it okay so I went back and I remarried where the middle of my basket was did my two and a half inches two and a half inches and back to the machine look at where I ran out can you believe it right before us then do that handle part ah that's because I wasn't paying attention and wasn't watching it's all back in again and I'll have to just backstitch here to secure my red hair and away we go again also up to this marker couple more spaces take the pin out and backspace that's different how many times have I said that you could do too much computer work in the sewing work at the same time and then I just interchange the words so we're going to back stitch already and that makes sure thanks to secure for they handle ok now this point in time now we're gonna angle the basket so we're only stitching on here again so angle it this way or if my head gets in the way [Music] stitch out to you're in stop rate of the pin mark and take the pin out because you know that's what went here's your marker so remember we're going to measure up to here and then we're going to add another two and a half inches or about six and a half centimeters so now I know I need to take this mark place it where my pin is let's take that pin out could I go right there I'm just gonna push that in with my scissors make sure it's in there I'm going to angle the basket so it's pointing toward that outside rope and then start to angle it up and making sure that's in there good and tight there we got it once we've got it back in the middle then I'm going to go forward a bit and back here we go now we can go around till we get to our other handle that we first made so go all the way around [Music] now we're getting close to our handle here so let me get to here we're not going to sew into this one we're going to sew these two together I'm just going to use my scissors to make sure that these stay together okay the book got them both together now I can lift up the presser foot just angle it out a bit and then so long these two [Music] your basket of forward and then you can see you're getting close to where your handle starts so we're just going to keep our rope tucked in there and now we're ready to go around again here's our handle again just swing into the handle [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and then finish off the handle I'm just going to backstitch because I want to take this basket off again now I know this is where my handles are so that's the middle this way I'm going to now squish my hands together and then I know where my mental is on the other side so I'm going to place the pin here and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to sew my cording just to there and then stop [Music] to finish this off I'm just going to tie a loose knot I'm going to hold it with my fingers right here so I make sure that the knot stays right up at the end here like so put a piece of tape on the end of my cording and make a little point with the tape and then I can spit some beads on easily there's the first one let's do another knot another bead and another knot you know like things in grouping of three and five rather than even I like odds I think it looks better so let's do one more and another knot and let's do one more knot let's cut off the end and you can just start to and Ravel this little using ordinary hair comb to unravel this or you can use a pet slicker and that will make it go a little bit faster for you well the easiest way is just to bite down on the table and then brush away this particular rope has a synthetic core inside so I'm just going to cut that away and then trim it up well I hope I've inspired you to go big and make this beautiful big rope basket and you can use it for so many cool things I've got my wool in here right now maybe your dog gets sad for his dog toys or your child's room to put all their toys in or use it for a shopping bag thank you for watching until next time fine [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "lAM90VD1y8g": "What's up garment decorators! We're here\nto talk to you today about some dye sublimation. Did you know you can dye\nsublimate on more than just 100% white polyester t-shirts? I'm AJ, this is Kirk, we're going to show you today on how to do different blends of t-shirts and a\nwide range of colors. First we pressed 100% polyester t-shirts.\nYou can see we did white, a columbia blue, and a dark grey. All the same exact print, and as you can see with 100% polyester, after you wash, the colors stays the same. You're never going to have any fading when you use 100% polyester, but you are going to have the different contrast of the color coming through the inks. As you can see here on this white, the colors were super vibrant. You know, white is the best for colors. But, also, there's some cool effects on the columbia blue. Really like the colors. I like it. The look is what, you know it makes it totally different. As you can see, the\ncolor, even between the yellows on the grey - totally different. So what we did, we went and found some tri-blends, because I like more of a softer shirt. I'm kind of the guy, that kind of t-shirt snob, so I liked that type of stuff. So we went and found some tri-blends and these are like 75% polyester they got\n12% of the rayon and also 13% of your cotton. And so you look at, is like when I\npress this, I mean like what do you think? (It's cool) It looks good. But when you washed it, we're going to have a little bit of fading to it. But, I think it still overall looks great. So obviously you can do the traditional white, but then you also, your wash look, you're going have a little bit of fading. I'm a big fan of the sublimation on color. It kind of gives you that a little bit more to offer your\ncustomers. What do we have on? My favorite - 50% polyester, 25% cotton and 25% rayon. It's another style at tri-blend, but it's\nreally nice as well. It has a really fresh look when you press it. So don't get used to that, because as soon as you wash it you're going to get that better cool of a washed out look that a lot of people are going for these days. I like it. I mean I like the feel, and I think kinda of has\nthat faded look. Already looks like the garment's broken in. When you're pressing AJ, \nyou prefer to use like, when you tack stuff down - you know I'm a guy likes to use the spray. What about you and what else do you use? I like using the thermo\ntape. We have green and clear. Typically green is used more often just\nso you can see it on any color garment. But that's what I like. I like the tape\nit's tried and true. The spray is your favorite. I like using this spray a\nlittle bit. So you just kind of tack along on top of the paper. And it holds it in place. Don't have to use the tape. Just a light mist on the paper and it tacks it right in place so you don't have anything jumping off our ghosting. So more versatile for\nme because I'm doing kind of back and forth But whichever you use, obviously you still get the same results as you can see. So now AJ, let's just talk a little bit about\npricing and make sure that everyone understands like now we're using a lot\nnicer garments - they're tri-blends. So you have a little bit higher end shirt. So\nobviously you factor in obviously your time and your inks and your paper. But now you have the garment that's a little bit higher price. So don't forget now you're\nhaving an very nice garment, so you can charge more and get more for it. So obviously make sure you're getting what you're worth on these garments and\neverything else you're doing, because this is nice stuff and it's neat. So you can get all these different styles of garments that you saw here today by\ngoing to HeatTransferClothing.com And anything in the dye sublimation world\nthat we talked about with the spray or the mist paper or ink by going to HeatTransferWarehouse.com Thank you decorators for watching our video today. Hopefully we taught you a little bit more about dye sublimation. You can check out this video more by going and subscribing to our YouTube channel.

there's a second most of good of Brandon the 55 $100 range so I'm pretty excited and I checked out the website and you know they had way too many photos of pale British Oxford types with beautifully coiffed hair I was immediately intrigued and they were British luxury and in big bold letters they said son spell played a little role in the birth of this the universal wardrobe staple the t-shirt a part of our heritage that we like to think gives us a certain expertise when it comes to knowing exactly what takes the best feature possible I mean England since 1860 Wow so they served in making t-shirts when Lincoln was still president they were making t-shirts more than 40 years before Ford made the Model T when Sun spell first started making clothing in 1860 they're gonna be people working there who could remember the Revolutionary War so I was imagining what kind of deep insights about the t-shirt that Sons ball had discovered in their whole process of making t-shirts for a hundred and sixty years so I keep reading lightweight ultra fine long staple pima cotton provides extraordinary softness comfort and lightness nice pink cotton I mean at $90 a t-shirt make it be using cashmere or silk no actually I'm telling you there's a company called Nodame nee-nee-nee dumb they make t-shirts from cashmere silk and it feels really really awesome but you have to hand washing and there's just is not enough time to do that [Music] so what's FEMA cotton so a cotton ball is may have a bunch of fibers and pima cotton is a specific strain of cotton where each of the fibers that make up the entire cotton ball is longer than normal which when you twist it into yarn makes it have a softer hand feel than short staple cotton or short fiber cotton and then finally they say made at the Sun spell Factory in Long Eaton England oh I'm 100% positive I've never worn something sung by someone with a British accent if I was an equation to get any crayon strong smooth fine cotton thread that what can go through being worn or bottom I think not positive that they're describing ring-spun cotton which is when you spin the cotton fibers into yarn that's super super tight and it makes it kind of fabric more durable so this is a one a hundred sixty year old British luxury and heritage brand - that helped birth the t-shirt and three is now using its expertise to make pima ring-spun t-shirts with a classic thing at ninety dollars that's a steal so I get the package and it feels good it's lightweight has a bit of the ring-spun stiffness as well as a bit of a roughness to it so it really does feel like a vintage t-shirt from the 50s something that you know Marlon Brando might have worn there's an imperceptible sheen which enhances that vintage look I put it on I like the fit it's on the boxers side but not Kanye and a little long so very much the classic fit there you know describing and then I notice the sleeve opening is a little bit on the tight side and it's weird it feels a little coarse around the neckline is that a hanging tagger no not the Hang tag but there's something sharp and rough like like uncut nails just going all around the neckline so as I'm fingering this in the neckline scene I noticed that the stitching feels like the stitching you would use for industrial grade tarp each of the stitches is coarse and sharp and I can feel each one of them poking at my fingers so in a normal t-shirt you ever seen like this it's normal nothing fancy and quite soft you don't feel it when was the last time you wore a t-shirt and complain what when si feels terrible but this so this is this is the the Sun spell neckline it's a it's a fancier neckline same I'll give it that and as a unique look but you can feel the stitches scratching your neck like the claws of a cat and then you begin moving your arms and you notice that they use the same kind of stitching in the arm so your bicep is getting cut up which is exacerbated by the fact that the sleeve opening is tighter than normal in my imagination when they were having the committee meeting to decide what kind of threat to use like I think it might have gone something like this hey boss so should we use normal cotton thread on this welcome it feels like they took the string that they tie burlap sacks with and got that British guy from Titanic to tighten it around my neck and arms I'm beside myself it is not like an unnoticeable detail this is something so clear this is something that is around my neck alright so you're probably wondering is it worth getting busy pissed off like is it really that bad okay fine I was going about my daily life it wasn't like I was obsessing over the scenes every single minute that's a lie I was okay when you're going about your daily life you might not notice it in every single moment but once you check in to see how it feels in the shirt as long as you have a neck and you have two arms you will notice the stitching and particularly perhaps oddly pissed off about the small little detail because some spell positions itself as not only luxury branding but a luxury brand with a hundred and sixty years of experience they're saying you should buy this 90 dollar t-shirt from us because we've been doing it for longer than anyone else and we make a luxury t-shirt that can't compare to all of your other shirts and yet this Sun spelled t-shirt is worse than your free t-shirt from like a crappy startup because it just I can't what I'm trying to say here is that one of the main selling points of luxury is their craftsmanship they choose the highest quality materials they have the broadest amount of experience and they obsess over all the teeny-tiny unseen details so that you don't have to go by the finest thread for sewing on even the back label not because that we're gonna notice but because that's the whole point of luxury craftsmanship and attention to detail even when we don't notice it's not don't get me wrong I get annoyed with luxury brands for all the same reasons that you do they mark its status to the wealthy and they push up lifestyle that's unattainable it makes everyone feel bad or tastes how ridiculous items like this $9,000 Tiffany's ball of yarn which apparently is what sun's values too so this neckline scene if by any chance this was interesting then check out our subreddit where there's more reviews and essays on clothing and if you'd like maybe even subscribe to us on YouTube", "Ek8ihgdfI-o": "okay so I want to show how I made these little sparkly varsity inspired t-shirts these are all the materials I used and I will list them out in the description box in case you want to know what they are so I just follow the instructions that came on the inside of the iron-on letters that I found in section and I just placed my letters on the back of my shirt and used my board that came on the back to measure it out and make sure it was all centered once it was centered I took my cotton press cloth and put it on top of the letters which the instructions that you need because you don't want to have that iron actually touch the letters also you want to make sure that your iron does not have any water in it it specifically says to use a dry iron so all I did was just pour out all the water that was in my iron and then what I went ahead and did is flipped it inside out so that the iron actually goes on the inside of the shirt too and I just used my phone to set a timer for 20 seconds because that's again what the instructions had to do just what I did because I have never done this before I also made sure that when I was looking for a shirt to do this on I used a shirt that had a lot of cotton in it due to the fact that I would be using a lot of heat and I know that you can't always use a lot of heat on synthetic material so kind of keep that in mind and there is all time I think it came out really cute just like this but I decided to add a little something extra so what I did is I found these little silver gems to glue on to it with some e6000 glue and I just took tweezers to pick up the gems on a toothpick to push it down onto the shirt at first I just put the little gems on basically like the corners of all the letters but I feel like that wasn't sparkly enough so I went ahead and put the little gems all around the letters kind of like the little outline tada and I think this came out so cute and I decided to do this again another shirt in a different color if you can't tell I decide to use with my favorite TV shows for inspiration for this of course you can do anything that you would like if you actually liked sports you could do that so yeah that's just basically where those names came from for me so I just did this shirt exactly the same way that I did the pink one the only thing that is going to be different is the way that I glued on the gems onto the letters so this time I went ahead and glue down the crystals to the inside of the letter to outline the whole letter just from the inside obviously and I like this because it was a different look from the other one and I think that this actually like is my favorite one of the two just because it's a little bit more subtle but still very sparkly if that makes any sense of sparkly can be subtle this one I like a lot better this one was more time-consuming I think just because even though the name is smaller I feel like I still used maybe more little gems it just seemed like it took a little longer but at this point I had been using e6000 glue over the course of like two days and that stuff is it's very strong so maybe that was just messing with my head a little bit [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] they are all finished I think they came out super cute so thank you so much for watching", "d9mWBSxtxT0": "what's going on guys welcome back to the factory where yes my hip my hair has grown a lot it's a lot longer than the last time i made a video so hopefully you like it today we are going to be talking about true classic t so as all of you guys know i'm a huge t-shirt guy especially now that we're all like quarantined and working from home i've always loved t-shirts i started just wearing t-shirts to work all the time because i like t-shirts they're comfortable they don't go all up on on your neck and they're just they're just comfortable they're easy they look good and basically the founders of true class of tees they wanted to have a simple basic t-shirt that wasn't cheap something that had great material didn't shrink when you washed and dried it and just something something comfortable no logos and just easy smooth i personally think that they nailed it uh this is one of them uh true classic teeth did reach out to me they sent me these t-shirts but uh you guys i'm gonna give you the honest review and tell you the actual truth about these t-shirts so just cutting to the meat i know everyone's probably watching this video to figure out sizing on true classic tees so i'm six foot one 185 pounds um and this is what i look like on the video so i ordered a large and an extra large i usually like my t-shirts to you know fit a little bit longer if you follow the channel for a while you know that but i like my t-shirts to fit longer i like them a little bit looser i'm not into tight t-shirts at least on me or on anybody pretty much the large the extra large wanted to try both on let you guys know just basically how sizing is what it looks like so this is a large i i think that if i was just going to buy one of their t-shirts right now which honestly if you are a medium large or extra large and you're thinking about getting this t-shirt you should probably just go ahead and pull the trigger because these t-shirts sell out um if you're interested in a certain color or size like i go on their website now checking things like different t-shirts that i want to get and smalls you you only see smalls because they they launch their t-shirts their soft t-shirts are nice t-shirts so honestly if you're thinking about it just pull the trigger they actually have a cool sizing tool on their website that i tried for myself after i tried on the t-shirts just to see if it was like reliable see if i could count on it and i did find it helpful i could never get it to suggest an extra large i was playing around with all of the settings but uh when i just did my actual settings like by my height body weight everything it suggested a large you also can choose if you like your t-shirt to fit loose or tight so pretty cool and um and i like when it's actually accurate so you can trust that sizing tool on the website so i'm going to show you guys all the different colors that i got they're right here if you uh probably already saw them so i have a large and extra large in each one so uh i've got a blue like a dark blue color which looks it looks really good and it goes and you can dress it up you can dress it down uh really nice and then a gray one i love gray t-shirts and i thought this gray nailed it so i got the color three pack so when you go online uh the link is in the description down below so you go online and you'll be able to see the different color packs there's tons of different color packs you can buy v-necks all sorts of uh great t-shirt combinations one-off t-shirts if you just want to buy one t-shirt to start and see how much you love it because you're going to and it's a great t-shirt so the link to buy is in the description down below it it gives you 15 off so that's nice all right now i'm going to show you guys obviously here's a large i'll do the slow spin i probably need to work on my posture haven't been outside in a while so it just it is what it is nowadays um but okay so that's the large now i'll switch to the extra large all right here you go so here is the extra large and it's it's comfortable it's definitely bigger like it still looks good i still think that it looks good i still like it and i i think that if i'm feeling you know maybe pretty fit that day maybe i'll go into a yoga or going to a yoga class maybe just doing yoga here in my apartment you know working out doing something sporty i'll probably wear a little bit smaller one because you know maybe i'll be looking my best but maybe you feel like a couch potato you want to take it easy you over it you're going to a buffet assuming that it's open or that buffets exist after quarantine that just hit me i have no idea if buffet will ever exist again but uh you get a bigger size so if you need a little more space or you just like a bigger size which i usually like the bigger size but to be honest in the true classic tee i i just like i just like the uh i just like the large um one fun fact i did wash all these t-shirts so i wore them all and i washed them all and then i only dried this this version the green version and they didn't shrink at all so i they advertise them that they won't shrink they don't shrink so that's super nice but but just to prove to you i'm going to show you guys the other t-shirts on real quick so obviously extra large here i'll give you a full spin if you're still watching okay now let me show you some of the other colors and you can see these ones are dry the other ones weren't and uh you can check the sizes here's the extra large and gray as you can see fits the exact same all right now here is the extra large and blue again uh same fit okay so here is the blue large so i think what i really like about this t-shirt is that it is fitted but it's not like too tight like it's not like i feel like i'm getting like so hugged around the chest and stomach in the back like it's it's nice to fit it like it fits great it looks great uh the hem actually comes over the shoulder a little bit giving it a unique style which i i think it looks a little different and really cool that's nice and here is the gray large so the fabric quality is great after one wash the color still looks great even after the dried the green it did not fade at all it looks really good the fabric quality still feels nice and durable and again one thing that's so nice about t-shirts that i love and i'm obviously not selling you on t-shirts but just the idea of a good t-shirt is it's versatile you can work out in it you can do whatever you need to you can you know you can dress it up you can go to work with it whatever you need to do you can do it in a good looking t-shirt and that's what these are so first of all thank you true classic t's for

everyone welcome back to my channel and if you are new to my channel hello Horowitz oh my name is Sean and yet welcome so for today's video I'm going to be doing a little bit of a DIY with you guys I haven't done idea why I feel like in forever a slowly hybin year and it's like ever since when I first started like my youtube channel I know I did a little DIY on like cutting your sleeves off your shirt to kind of make it a muscle shirt I was really big into that but today I'm going to be showing you guys how to crop your shirt so instead of cut the sleeves off dead ones we're gonna cut shirt across let me show you how I end up doing that cuz there are definitely ways where you can mess it up and especially if you only have one shirt then that's what you got so you just go work with it I really am big into like high-waisted like yellow pants especially like working out or high-waisted shorts and look that I like to pair it with a crop top I just feel like it looks super cute with the combo together found this shirt at Target and I thought it was super super super cute this one right here soo simple gray and I love that it says savage on the front of it but the way that the shirt kind of tails off into it is more like a high-low I love the loose clothes and I like loose-fitting things on me but the way that this shirt is I just feel like it's just too big and whatever so I figured I'm definitely when I saw I was like if I'm getting this I'm definitely gonna cut it into a crop top just have basically the word Savage shown and then everything else below that it's gonna be cut off except some some it really depends on how short you want your crop top to be and I'll show you how I end up kind of guesstimating figuring out how high I do want the crop top if you are wondering this is in a size medium but like I said I do like my shirts a little loose what I do to kind of measure is just to make sure that I line and he it shoulder seams together and then I will pretty much guess to me my belly bump is covered with the high-waisted so I don't want it to go I don't want the cut to go too far up but I also don't want it to be like too far low as well that makes any sense at all finally my belly button and that is basically where I'm just going to give it a trim on the shirt if you want and if you do feel comfortable with marking it you can mark it put it on if you aren't really into guesstimating and you just want it to be perfect definitely put it on and measure it out I ain't no time for that I'm just gonna cut it I do want to mention that it's always best to cut lower so if you do need to cut it and bring it up like an inch you can like have the room to cut it because once you cut this shirt completely that's it that's all you got if it's too short it's definitely too short so you're just going to make it work so like I said we're gonna go ahead and line it up and then I find my belly button I kind of like show you that's exactly where I want it right right here and then I'm just going to fold it just like so and that gives me a pretty good idea of the length that I do want my shirt let's start cutting I have it folded at the link that I do want the shirt and I'm going to just turn it sideways so one side is like facing me you're gonna let some scissors I got these extra heavy-duty scissors there I don't know utility scissors they cut through pretty much anything so I'm definitely going to be using a mat just to make things easier if you do want to give yourself a little bit of extra leeway just in case you feel like you don't want to cut too high and obviously we're in the shirt then go ahead and just kind of give it an extra half an inch or an inch of of extra room go ahead and just take my scissors and it just cuts true right across in this line and make sure that you do have some tension on the scissors and on the fabric just so the cut isn't too wobbly and make it like super and even as you can see I'm just going to cut straight across as I'm cutting I'm also pulling on the fabric of the shirt just so the cut just gets tight and it makes it easier to cut the shirt as well we just cropped a shirt so all this extra room I don't know if you want to recycle it you can if you want to turn it into a headband go for it do what you do with extra fabric and getting back to the crop top I'm just gonna go ahead and show you how it cut and then I kind of like it to be a little ruffled at the ends of it so I'm just gonna go ahead and just pinch and pull and that is just gonna make edges of the shirt just kind of roll up and give it that more like naturally distressed look I know throwing it to wash it definitely helps it with that as well but if you want to wear the shirt now this is definitely key in doing so it's just kind of pinching and pulling the fabric just so it does do that whole Rolly thing there you know that is how I cut up a shirt and I'll go ahead and put it on just so I can show you guys how it looks on me I am back and as you can see I do have the crop shirt on right now this is like literally the perfect length like when a crop top is not too long where it just hangs right over like literally two or three inches over the high-waisted area but you know just enough where you can see just a little just a little bit of skin here is what it looks like in the back and yeah like literally love the way it looks now we're taking a little bit more my style instead of having it super long I guess that is everything for this video like this video if you found it helpful and definitely let me know how it goes if you crop your shirt follow me on Instagram Twitter Facebook I will have all that listed right here and I'll have all the information listed down below as well thank you so much for watching and I'll see you my next video bye", "9QmTnHNb8ro": "Hey guys, welcome to my fibres and fabrics series. In this video, part one, I'll be talking about some common materials that you likely have or will come across.  And what the pros and cons are for both everyday use and the environmental impact. Part two will be about vegan synthetic versus animal materials. And part 3 will be all about upcycled and recycled materials. So definitely check those out as well. So first up is cotton, and I'll include time codes below for the different materials if you want to jump ahead or reference certain ones. Cotton is probably the most common fabric and it's a natural fibre, it comes from the cotton plant And it is:  soft, breathable (meaning that air can move through it and moisture can evaporate through it), easy to clean (it's machine washable), absorbent, versatile ( there's tons of different kinds of cotton materials and garments), it's good for people with allergies or skin sensitivities The cons are that it doesn't hold dye really well so it fades overtime and can also bleed while being washed. It wrinkles, it can shrink in hot water, especially the first time it's washed. The environmental pros are that it is biodegradable. And the environmental cons are that it needs a lot of water to grow. It's also usually bleached and chemically treated and dyed. Cotton also has one of the highest pesticide uses for crops. And it's generally GMO as well. But these two things are prevented by purchasing organic cotton. Next is Linen, and it's another natural material It comes from the flax plant and it was used all the way back in ancient Egypt. And linen as a fibre is:  breathable, durable, lightweight, absorbent, it's generally very cool and good for summer time, I also read that it's antimicrobial but I wasn't able to find very much in-depth information to back that up The cons are that is wrinkles easily It often requires gentler or hand washing and sometimes there is fake linen or 'linen look' material so you have to be careful of that. The environmental pros are that it requires little pesticides and water to grow, especially compared to cotton. And it is biodegradable. And the cons are that it can sometimes be dyed with toxic chemicals but it depends on how it's made. Another plant fibre is hemp. And it comes from the cannabis plant but a type that's only used for hemp production. And as a fibre it is:  durable, absorbent, it becomes softer with wear and washing, it's breathable and it can also be hypoallergenic. The cons are that it can sometimes be rough, it wrinkles and different countries sometimes have very strict laws around growing and processing hemp. So there are difficulties around that with hemp fabric production. The environmental pros are that it doesn't require pesticides or lots of water to grow, It doesn't deplete nutrients from the soils so it's a really good crop. It is biodegradable and because it's very durable the garments usually last long And for environmental cons, I really couldn't find anything. It's basically seen as being the most eco-friendly material. Then there's polyester, which is likely the most common synthetic fibre. It's made from petrochemicals and is:  wrinkle resistant,  durable, it dries quickly it's colourfast, it's machine washable it tends to retain it's shape well and it's cheap. The cons are that it doesn't breathe which can also cause it to become smelly, it builds up static and it can also irritate the skin. An environmental pro is that it can be recycled but this does require another chemical process. And the environmental cons are that it doesn't biodegrade, fibres come off of it when it's being washed and those end up polluting the ocean, it's energy intensive and very polluting to make, toxic chemicals are used to make it  and it's also very difficult to dye which requires a lot of chemicals. Then we have wool.  Wool is a natural protein fibre like your hair.  And it mainly comes from sheep but can also come from alpacas, goats and other animals. Wool as a fibre is: very warm (it's even warm when wet), water resistant, durable, very absorbent, flame resistant and hypoallergenic. The cons are that it shrinks in hot water, it must be hand washed or dry cleaned, it can pill and depending on the kind of wool, it can be itchy or irritating to the skin. The environmental pros are that it's easily dyed, which usually means there are less harsh chemicals used, it's biodegradable and because it's very durable it means that the garment will usually wear really well and can be kept for a long time. The environmental cons are that because it comes from an animal there are issues and concerns around the treatment and care and wellbeing of those animals. And I will talk more about that in part two. Toxic chemicals and pesticides can also be used and this can be avoided by looking for organic wool. Next is acrylic which is a synthetic petrochemical fibre. It was developed to be a man made alternative to wool and it is:  lightweight, soft, colourfast, machine washable and cheap. The cons are that it tends to pill easily it doesn't breathe, it builds up static. For the environmental pros, I really couldn't find anything. And the cons are that it doesn't biodegrade, it's not easily recycled, there are toxic chemicals used to make it, it's energy intensive and again fibres wash off of it that end polluting the oceans. Then there's silk which is a natural protein fibre. It comes from the cocoon of the silk worm. And it is: very soft, it has a natural sheen,  it's lightweight has a good drape, so it generally looks very nice in clothing and it's often good for very sensitive skin. The cons are that it's expensive, it requires hand washing or dry cleaning, it's not very durable and it's susceptible to discolouration from sunlight or perspiration. The environmental pros are that it is biodegradable, and it dyes very easily. And the environmental cons are that the silk worms are actually killed in the process of harvesting the silk from the cocoons so it is not at all an ethical or vegan material. Next is nylon another synthetic made from petrochemicals It was developed to be a synthetic replacement for silk. And it is:  strong, weather resistant, versatile, water repellent, machine washable, it dries quickly and it's cheap. The cons are that some types of nylon build up static, it can irritate skin The environmental pros are that it is a pretty durable material so the garment will usually last a long time And for the cons, like with polyester, fibres come off when it's washed that end up polluting the oceans, toxic chemicals are used to make it, there are a lot of harmful emissions, it's energy intensive and it's not biodegradable. Then there's spandex, also called elastane or lycra. It's a very elastic fibre also made from petrochemicals. And it's usually found blended with other fibres. It is: stretchy, it helps clothes retain their shape, and it can help with fit. The cons are that it breaks down over time, it can also become brittle and yellow. The environmental pros are that it can help make clothes not stretch out and the environmental cons are that it doesn't biodegrade, it's energy intensive and polluting to make and toxic chemicals are used. Finally there's a few naturally derived synthetic fibres. The first I'll talk about is rayon and it's primarily made from a wood pulp that goes through a chemical process. And as a fibres it's:  soft, inexpensive, absorbent, anti-static, (unlike other synthetic materials), The cons are that it's not very durable, it tends to pill, it wrinkles, it loses strength when wet and can easily become misshapen and it also shrinks very easily. I actually couldn't really find any environment pros for rayon except for the fact that it uses less toxic chemicals than other synthetics but there's still toxic chemicals, so I still see that as a con. Because it's a wood pulp it can contribute to deforestation and it's energy intensive to make. There's also bamboo and the majority of bamboo is actually bamboo viscose or a bamboo rayon And countries have different laws about whether or not it has to be labeled as viscose derived from bamboo or a bamboo rayon.  But basically it's the same process as rayon but instead of using wood pulp, they use bamboo. And as a fibre it is soft, breathable, very absorbent, and also doesn't build up static. The cons are that like rayon, some bamboo fabrics will pill really easily and I like I mentioned different countries will have different rules as how it's supposed to be labeled so that can be confusing. The environmental pros are that bamboo is very renewable to grow and requires little water and pesticides. And the cons are that there are still toxic chemicals used to make the material, and it's energy intensive. And the last fibre I'm going to talk about is lyocell or tencel. And it's another naturally derived synthetic made from wood pulp. And it is: soft, very absorbent, resistant to wrinkles, versatile, durable, breathable, anti-static and also claims to be hypoallergenic. The cons are that it can pill easily and also sometimes needs special care. The environmental pros are that it is biodegradable, It's made in a closed loop system so the chemicals are recycled.  And it's much less toxic to produce than other synthetics and natural synthetics like rayon. The cons are that it is still uses quite a bit of energy to produce and because it does come from wood pulp it could also contribute to deforestation but overall it is the most environmentally friendly synthetic material. So of course there are also other materials than the ones I've mentioned and you'll also likely find a lot of blends. And blends can combine the benefits of both materials but it can also negate some of them. For example,  a polyester/cotton blend will mean that the item is no longer biodegradable. As you've probably noticed, no material is perfect. And it's just about trying your best to make informed decisions and also choosing the right materials for the function of the garment. I personally try to stick with natural materials for both comfort and environmental reasons. But it doesn't make sense all the time. For example with swimwear, it makes much more sense to have something that doesn't absorb water and dries quickly. So I hope you've found this interesting and maybe learned something. Please let me know in the comments if they are any pros or cons that I missed.

Well, it turns out there are actually at least\nfour ways to properly store and fold your t-shirts. In today\u2019s video, I\u2019m going to teach you\nall four methods including a trick to fold a t-shirt in less than three seconds. Method number one. The basic fold. This is the simple method that most people\ndefault to. Lay the t-shirt out flat face down, fold the\nshirt in half from left to right. Then, fold the sleeves in towards the middle. Now, fold the shirt in half from top to bottom. You can either stop here or fold it in half\nagain to take up a little bit less room. The advantage of this method is it\u2019s simple,\nit\u2019s well-known, and it\u2019s equally useful for storage or travel. The main disadvantage is you\u2019re likely to\nhave some wrinkles and creases develop where you folded the shirt. The second method is known as the marine roll\nalso called the army roll, but, hey, I\u2019m a marine here. It\u2019s popular in the military for its efficient\nuse of space. Lay the shirt out flat face up and then fold\nthe bottom of the shirt up three to four inches. Smooth out the fabric to minimize wrinkles,\nthen fold the shirt into thirds, start on the left side folding it over the center,\nthen take the left sleeve and fold it back over the center. You\u2019ll now do the same with the right side\nbring it over before folding the right sleeve back to the center. Now, you\u2019re ready to start rolling. Start at the collar making sure you keep the\nroll nice and tight. Once you get to the end, you\u2019ll undo the\nfold you created at the bottom of the shirt and tuck it over each end of the roll to keep\nit in place. This roll takes up very little space, so it\u2019s\nperfect for small storage spaces or you\u2019re traveling light with a small suitcase. The disadvantage of the marine roll is it\ntakes more time than all the other methods. Method three. The hanger. The third method doesn\u2019t require any folding\nor rolling, you\u2019re simply going to put your shirt on a hanger and place it in your closet. Make sure though that you use plastic hangers\nfor this. Wire hangers can cause the dreaded nipple\neffect which isn\u2019t a great look and you don\u2019t want basically to have to throw your\nshirts into the dryer or launder them again so that the cotton goes back to its original\nshape. The main advantage to using the hanger method\nis you\u2019re going to avoid the creases and wrinkles that are sometimes caused by folding. In addition, if you\u2019ve got a closet with\na lot of space, this may be a great place to put it versus into a dresser drawer. The disadvantage of the hanger method is if\nyou have a small closet, it\u2019s going to end up taking a lot of space especially if you\nhave a lot of t-shirts. And if you travel quite a bit, you\u2019re going\nto have to take the shirts off the hangers and then fold them. Method number four and my favorite, the two-second\nfold. So, this final method creates a great-looking\nfold so fast it\u2019s practically magic. Lay the shirt out flat, smoothing it out to\nremove any wrinkles. You\u2019re going to imagine two lines; one that\ngoes across the middle of the shirt, one that goes top to bottom between the collar and\nthe sleeve. Where the lines intersect is going to be point\nA, the top of the shirt is going to be point B, and the bottom of the shirt is point C.\nPinch point A with your left hand. Make sure to grab both the top and bottom\nlayer of the fabric. Pinch point B with your right hand, then bring\npoint B down to point C. You will now uncross your arms and lay the shirt face down on the\ntable. Use the table to fold the shirt until you\nhave an even amount of fabric on each side of the shirt. If you want, you can fold it again in the\nmiddle to take up a bit less space. With a bit of practice you can become lightning\nfast with this method. There is truly no faster way to fold a t-shirt. There you have it gentlemen, four effective\nways to fold and store your t-shirts. So, whenever you need them whenever you\u2019re\ntraveling, you\u2019ve got them ready to go.

murmur made it better and I member claims it's the world's first performance cotton so is he gear and they range from 25 bucks come in a lot of colors and he the next one that I'm going to get her sleeveless ones workout in so I've worked in it out in a few times and I really waiting for to work out this summer and see how it works let's see if it really does a draw fast and or just see how it works and I really haven't worked out a lot in it I've just been wearing it because I mean it's still just a stylish shirt to wear anytime but I just I'll give it a little more look at the shirt here now sleeve we got you know Under Armour symbol and then charge we get kind of a this is a raised logo it's not it's like raised off the shirt it's kind of cool and then it says in Armour charge cotton heat gear it is loose loose gear down the back you just got the little underarm symbol on the back but oh man it is a very nice t-shirt and if you're into like seriously working out and you sweat a lot I think this would be an awesome t-shirt be great it's made in men's and women's style so there's like I said there's just a lot of styles you can get into and Under Armour really takes this shirt and which I'm starting to think this shirt may be better than the tech T and I haven't got enough of them No so uh I'll definitely Rick I recommend this shirt to anybody and it's very nice I'd give it a five star review just I like it a lot but uh let's see what it looks like on me", "73fYS8zVITo": "hey everybody joy here we're going to talk about sewing today for those of you who like sewing videos from me it is about noon on a thursday and it's march 11 2021 and i want to show you my new gadget it's not really new i mean it is it's brand new it just got here but i mean it's not like a new invention so i wanted to show you why i got another one when i already had one okay so this is called something this is called something but i don't know what it is probably a hem marker hem a hem marker i'll put it in the description box below by the way speaking of description boxes have you noticed that i have an amazon store now my friend becky called and said oh you know what an amazon store they're horrible they're always out of everything well you all understand i have no control over whether or not the item say i put this in there i have no way of making them keep it in stock or i have no control over the pricing you all understand that i'm just going to show it to you in my shop i have three categories i have um an organization one which is where i showed you the things i put my jewelry in and the things i organized my closet with i have the sewing one and i have the quilting one so almost every single video somebody asked me what iron do you use what ironing board do you use what this do you use what that do you use where can i find it so now that i have an amazon store everything's all together and you can just go to that one link and then you can find it all there and that way i don't have to constantly think of what i need to tell you oh this is where you find the iron this is where you find the board this is where you find the steam scene you understand a lot of you have requested that i do an amazon store so you just go to amazon.com slash shop shop not store amazon.com shop think of hop to the shop amazon.com and my name joy bernhardt and it will take you to my little store excellent okay so i'm going to put that link under all of my videos so one of these will be in it now this is very very old this is probably as old as my daughter i bought it way way way way way back when well it has been in a closet for years and years and years i never use it i always had philly or i had jerry to mark the hems and i hardly ever ever ever ever make dresses right well now i'm getting ready to make a lot of dresses and i made these two dresses you saw the other day the black one and the green one so i got this out of the closet to try to use it so i could mark my own hem well let me get up close and i'll show you what happened look at that do you see this kink that kink right there this has been hanging this has been sitting in the closet for so many years you know it just dawned on my lightning fast mind i probably could pull this off and cut it and get the kink out of it hey how about that just push this little thing and chalk comes out this and then you just move it around and around and around you turn around and you keep squirting a little ball and it squirts some chalk where you want your hem to be then it guarantees that your hem is parallel to the floor okay let me show you kind of how it works you unlock this then you can move this up and down up and down see so then you just walk around and you squirt and you squirt and you squirt and you squirt your squirt now the thing is i can't just fold the hem up one inch or two inches like it tells you in the pattern hem allowance two inches because i'm not even even though i fix my low shoulder i still have a high hip below hip and there's no way just hemming up a dress isn't going to be even and parallel to the floor not going to happen on me super super nice to have but like i said this one wasn't working so i ordered a new one and i didn't order another one of these because i figured it would just kink again i can't believe i didn't think about cutting that off the other day so here's the new one this is a new improved version it has wheels this doesn't this is light as a feather i can hold it up with one finger very very light this is very heavy and i can hardly lift it with two hands okay heavy and it rolls so this one will be much more stable and it rolls and i would suggest that you always do this on a hard floor not on carpet so i just opened this i just had jerry help me open the box so you put this in this hole right there and you tighten it turn the little wing nut and it doesn't work i think it's going to take my husband there's a nut on here and you're going to have to loosen the nut a knot shouldn't be doing the nut because it doesn't work right so anyway if the nut wasn't there now jerry just show me what you do with the nut anyhow i've been trying to figure out that about for 45 years okay so this little thing right here is what you put the chalk in and i don't know if there's chalk already in it so i'll be careful no there's no chalk in it so that's the little container and so i will pour the chalk in a little container and then you put the lid on and it just snaps on and then you hook it i kind of know how it works because i've got this other one right so you hook it and then these you just pull apart this is like a little um a little hair clip and you just squeeze it oh of course that isn't tight yet you squeeze it and it goes up and down and so then there's a uh a ruler here on the side now i don't know i guess you could figure out how far you wanted to be off the floor let me see how that works yes yes so 15 inches up on this equals 15 inches up on this so you figure out how far off the floor you want your ham and go for it yay how fun is that yes i have to take this downstairs and have jerry fix that bolt for me isn't that fun isn't that fun so this is not from amazon this is from waywack so i'll put a link to it it's very nice heavy duty and it has a much bigger look here this has this little bitty squirty thing whoa really nice big one you can hold it in your hand better and go and this has a wider a wider squirty spout on it and then when you're not using it it has a really cool little notch up there at the top to hang this in how awesome is that so you don't get that on here and so that's how it got all kinked up and yes i did tape it to the top but the tape wore out and the thing fell down all righty so i'm going to come back in a little bit i'm going to have it with the chalk in it i'm going to have my dress on and i'm going to show you how it works okay super fun and then i can finish my two little dresses and start on the next one and before i shut down today i'll show you my new scan and cut design i did something and it actually turned out i was so happy when i went to bed last night i thought there is still hope for me all right i'll be back in a mega second for y'all okay this is kind of like a cane this is so much nicer than that other one it was quite a bit more this was probably 45 i know it wasn't cheap but you only have to buy it one time in your life so what i have to do is figure out where i want this to squirt the chalk so i have a pen in my dress where i want the hem to be i just showed this to jeffrey he said he's dying laughing i said what are you laughing for it's not funny okay so that's 20 20 inches off the floor is where i want my hem and i'll guarantee you if i just fold it up the same distance this however far this is all the way around it will not be leveled to the floor i can promise you so i'm going to put this on the 20. if you can find the 20 oh there it is right there so you just squeeze this pull it up turn it so it's aiming at you so you have to stand up straight you have to stand up straight now i haven't used this yet now see i can't be bending over like this which is what i'd be doing if i was trying to pin it and use a ruler so i'm going to stand up straight i'm going to squirt let me look at the mirror and see if it works squirt squirt huh look at that look at that do you see it yeah jeffrey's just mad because he doesn't wear dresses stand straight shoulders even yeah i think we're going to make it i can't see what i'm doing but i hope it's working it is it's working oh it's working y'all oh my gosh this is wonderful tell me if you have this and you already use it okay there's all the marks this is really a fun little tool now remember this is the very first time i've ever ever used this i just got it today so i have squeezed all the way around in the front i've got two lines because i had to go higher remember so i'll use the higher line yeah and then i'll hem my dress oh my goodness what a fun tool okay let me go put my ham in and then we'll check it and see how good it turns out okay i'll be back i want to show you this i read the directions which i didn't the last few times i used it it says base two wrong side of fabric with fused side up for hemming then press in place with the press clock so that's what i did i hemmed it to the edge to this outside edge this is sticky now on this side this other side this is not steam a seam this isn't sticky in here so you put it on here according to the directions with the sticky side up then you fold it in and then you iron it down okay and then i will sew the hem up now i started out with a wide zigzag and the wide zigzag wanted to chew up the edges see so then i went to a straight stitch for a little bit somewhere a straight stitch right there and i decided well it didn't do much better so then i just went to a narrow zigzag on the very very very very edge and now i'm going to fold it up and iron it and then i'm going to sew the hem in and then i'm going to put this crazy dress nightgown whatever you want to call it back on well hi yeah i'm making a top to go with my red yoga pants there on lucy okay so here i've got the dress over the end of my ironing board now i wanted to remind you in my um amazon store amazon.com joy bernhardt i have this iron and this ironing board in it because she asked me all the time see so i'm just ironing it down on my crease my purple dots are going away with the iron it's wonderful see the purple dots there's that white interfacing it's fabulous folding it up on the crease that i've already ironed in it it's patting it down knit is alive remember this alive you have to tame it just like a lion you've got to show what who is the box see see how nice and flat it is now it's flat and neat and it'll be easy to sew the hem in look at how crooked and ripply it is right now not good you tried to sew that in with your sewing machine with it just waving around like that oh you would have such a mess when you got done up down up down up down don't go like this or you'll be spreading that fullness all over the place and i did my usual cut down here on the one and a quarter inch line so the seam flops to the opposite side you know how i like to do that so this goes that way and this part goes toward me okay here's the rest of it oh my goodness it's looking so tame so so flat okay now that that was iron on that was the iron on side of that interfacing and so now this is ironed on it's not going to come up and so when i go around it with my sewing machine to stitch this hem in it's just going to go around super super easy like as if it was a woven let's look at the bottom and see how it looks now to hold this up to the world it's probably as crooked as it can be at the bottom insofar as being parallel to the floor but on me it's gonna be perfect i'm gonna go sew this hem in and i'll be back well let's see how good my new wonderful little chalk hem marker did i really like this this cost more but it's worth it has a really nice handle it holds the tubing so it won't kink it has the bigger squeezy thing on it oh nice so let's see how it did on even ah let me see that's the back look at that even steven looks good looks good [Music] the side is 22 and a half this side is 22 and a half the front is 22 and a half the back is at now if i stand up straight 22 and a half so it is parallel to the floor whereas my body is not and a lot of you aren't either i promise you yeah age has a way of doing that to us so yes where did i get this ruler lowe's or home depot one it's metal it's hard it's metal and it's really nice you can read it real easy and see it really nice so next stop is the washing machine to get all the chalk off of it hopefully all of the the vinyl won't come off of it but hey get you one of these it is really nice now remember this nice one they don't have this on amazon you have to get this from way wacked way whack i'll put a link below okay you want to see my new new new new new scanning cut hey did you see what i did here can you see that that is removable vinyl i can put some tape on top of that and pull it right off of there and i could go stick it on the closet door or stick it on a chair or do whatever of course i never will but i just thought oh my gosh that's removable i'm going to put it up here to remind myself to reverse my design i should have reversed it this is going to be the video that never ends oh it's such a nice day cloudy outside so i don't want to go outside and get sun i did get my new um recliner chair though next time i go out there to get sun i'll show you a picture of it it is so nice did you know they actually make recliners with cupholders yes it's totally true so i went downstairs to work on supper it's four o'clock and i had taken some pork chop butterflied pork chops out this morning boneless butterflied pork chops so they were all thought out so i decided we're gonna do bada-bing bottom being is some recipe i tore out of a magazine years ago they are really good it's got the oddest ingredients the oddest it's got zesty italian dressing worcestershire sauce applesauce hot pepper sauce and what's the other thing do i say apple sauce lime a whole lime squeezed you mix it all up and you pour it on the pork chops and you marinate it for several hours then you cook them on the grill so i went down there to do pork chops and i noticed this package was on the counter i know i know and as usual i have completely forgotten so let's see if i can open it without cutting a hole in it for once in my life i'm going to try to push the material out of the way of the envelope okay i think it's out of the way are you out i'm wearing my green dress i'll tell you the most comfortable dress you're going to get you've got to stay home all the time anyway now lengthen a t-shirt a cotton knit fabric just lengthen it it is so comfortable i'll sleep in this tonight i'm sure okay so i think there's only four pieces here so i won't bore you for very long this is a denim this is a really cute denim yeah boy i got enough of it that's nice it's not very soft but it will be you all know how you softened denim right you watch peggy all the time like i do this is two and a half yards of a nice denim these would be really really cute pants i'm going to make those you know the pants i had on the other day the turquoise i had the turquoise top with the embroidered flower on it and the turquoise pants i'm gonna make a pair of those with this and a top to go with it is carolina blue tomato red light green multi 100 cotton floral printed lie lie light lie i just say run out of room on this machine so yes i am going to wash this with a coke peggy sager says throw it in the wash with a coke a regular normal everyday coke dump the coke on it wash it and it will come out soft that's what i'm going to do because it's not very soft electric blue silk cotton mid-weight woven 54 wide it really feels look at this wonder what it means when there's an arrow there's a little red arrow wonder what that means it doesn't say they gave me any extra it says to dry clean but i'm not going to dry clean this does not stretch no stretch at all but it's a silk and a cotton ah yes very

house we don't even have a dry cleaners in our city all right this one is different muted indigo blue cotton rayon abstract design jacquard suiting shooting whoa about suiting new york designer can you tell closer up to the camera but it's got the raised abstract pattern in it this is beautiful i can see why they'd call it a suit that's beautiful fabric happy with that i haven't shown you my new scanning cut design yet i have to go put it on it's not done i've got the neckline done and i've got the design on it i may just hold off till tomorrow i may go ahead and try to finish it i've got another two hours before dinner i think i'll go ahead and try to finish it the whole way and then i'll come back in the morning and i'll put that outfit on it's just a plain old simple summer no big deal outfit but the scanning cut i came up with the design i put together all by myself and um it turned out kind of cute so for you it'll be no time at all but for me i'll be back tomorrow and finish this video i want to show you this because it's white i use my new little chalk walker around her i just love that thing it's a thousand times better than the one i had before i want to show you why it is an invaluable tool not a new invention you might you guys are going we've had one of those for years if you have just turn me off turn me right off you probably already did but i want to show you how invaluable it is i know that i am a half inch shorter on my right side than i am on my left i'm a half inch taller on this side i'm a half inch shorter on this side because i have a slight c-shaped backbone because i've had scoliosis my whole life it hasn't gotten worse praise god for that but if you don't have one of these little things to do your hem with and you just take this and fold it up two inches all the way around you're going to have an uneven hem if you don't get your husband to come do it or your friend philly to come do it or whatever yeah i had my shirt off the first time philly saw me with my shirt off and she was measuring she said i have never seen a back like that joy you would be shocked if you saw my back so this is the back of the garment i'm working on now now the garment is even okay remember the garments even i cut it out with a paper pattern so it's even so if you're straight and you're not crooked you could just fold it up however much an inch two inches all the way around and it would be level to the floor on you but look at this line here and guess what i was able to see the white chalk on this white shirt yay so look at this now you move quite a bit when you're doing this so you have to kind of i went around and around and so and of course i'm not still so connect the dots the dots that make sense now this rides up on my underwear of course so i had to pull it down i had to stand still and so you can see the marks kind of jumped up and down but i can see the ones that are right and the ones that are wrong and i marked with this purple on top of the white chalk so i'd be sure it would stay here okay are you seeing the crookedness of this now this this is one side or the other it looks to me like this is my tall side now this is the side seam and it's the side seam over here on my tall side i know that i'm a half inch difference from this side to this side so let's see what the little rolly around each hot wheel decided i was off so right here is three inches three inches that's not where i'm going to hem it i'm gonna hem it at two inches what i'll do is i'll go around and i'll mark it two inches down from that line because i don't want my hem way up there this is just a mark straight okay this is just a mark level to the floor that's not where i'm gonna hem it at okay so this side measured at three inches let's see what this other side measured at now this is my right side my short side let's see what it measured it measured exactly three and a half inches see there see how accurate the little wheelie dealie with the chalk is so we have to go from three and a half inches on one side to three inches on the other side the only way in the world i can do that is with this chalk marker thing and so in order to hem this i know i want a two inch hem in the front so i want my hem two inches this is going to be over red leggings that i am currently wearing so i want this to be hemmed two inches so i am going to come down one inch all the way around from my chalk mark which is now purple i'm going to finish this top i don't want to show you the cute fun scan and cut design on it till i get it all done i cut a strip of this knit on the crosswise grain an inch and a half wide you can cut it two inches wide if you want to you're going to cut off the extra i measured the armhole opening it was 18 inches on the seam line so i cut this strip one inch less than that i cut this strip 17 inches long then i took a quarter inch you can see it right there i took a quarter inch seam in that strip okay then i marked the half points i put the same down here by the seam of the blouse i put the shoulder up here by the shoulder of the blouse and i stretch just a tiny bit you know how you stretch to put the neck on you want to do that around the sleeve of a knit as well you don't want it really tight but you want it a little a little bit shorter you want your band a little bit shorter because at least on me sleeve armhole openings always want a gape gap now i have it pinned on and i'm going to sew around it i've already done it on this armhole this armhole the strip is sewn on one half inch seam allowance that's the strip see the strip one half inch seam allowance and that's the inside one half inch so now i'm going to take this after i get the other one sewn on i'm going to trim the seam allowance down to one quarter inch then i'm going to fold the whole entire thing to the inside the whole thing and then i'm going to top stitch it probably 3 8 inch i'm going to top stitch at 3 8 inch then i'm going to cut off all of this extra because there's going to be too much but it's a lot easier to work with extra than if you were to cut it the exact because you're just using one layer yeah so that's how i'm doing my sleeveless armhole you could do it with the facing you could just search it and fold it under except i don't think you can do over 3 8 inch that way you'd have to make it a little bit narrower here's my armhole this is the half inch seam that's now trimmed down to one quarter inch one-quarter inch i'm taking the band and the seam allowance and folding the whole thing to the inside the whole thing so the outside here is again there's the seam on the inside the band on the outside i'm folding the whole thing to the inside am i going to under stitch it no because i'm going to top stitch it and sew it down and that should hold it but see that's what it's going to look like when it's done it's going to have some stitching going around here and then i'm just going to come back and trim the rest of this off so i have sewn it down i for the very first time did not use the steam seam two to iron this on on the back you can see it's all loose except for my stitching you can see the quarter inch seam allowance inside there and here i've sewn it all the way around 3 8 inch now i'm going to cut off this extra back here just a pair of scissors and i'm going to be very very careful that i don't cut too far see i'm going to cut all this extra off down to my sewn line i used a walking foot and it worked just wonderful walking puts important for a knit because a walking foot has feed dogs on the top so you have feed dogs on the top feed dogs on the bottom and it just makes it move evenly so you don't end up with a bunch of creases and tucks and pulls and and um all kinds of funky looking sprinkles see let me show you how to do this real quick to cut this extra knit this is from the strip the one and a half inch strip that i cut this is how much is left over so i want to show you how to cut it off so you don't cut into your garment take i've got it inside out so i'm on the inside where this is or i can see it real good fold it over on the seam line until it's on top of your hand see how it's on top of my hand there's the finished seam i'm folding it under and then i'm flipping out flipping out into the air this part i'm going to cut off so the scissors are going to touch my fingers when i put my scissors underneath here they're going to touch my fingers so it can't cut anything else because the only thing underneath here is my fingers see there if you don't do that you are going to cut right into your garment i promise you i'm very good authority on that here's what i cut off this is what i cut off of that strip that's why you can cut it two inches however wide don't get it over two inches that'd be too wide but you're just going to cut off the extra anyway and the extra helps you deal with it it is super super close now remember also my new sewing friends this is a knit a knit you could not do this to one unless you're using a knit for your band because knits don't ravel you're using wovens you have to have finished edges okay but for a knit ah that's one reason i love to make knits so much that's the finished armhole on the inside i just injured my thumb on my camera rolling it down i rolled it onto my thumb ouch and i don't have a bandaid so oh my i'm going to try not to bleed so pardon the paper towel for those of you who don't know what a walking foot is this is a walking foot you hook it onto your machine like you would any any of your feet but it has a little bar that goes around this um this thing where your needle goes in and out and you turn that that little knob right there there's a little bar like this a fork bar and you hook it over that bar right there so then when you sew can you see it moving it walks that's why it's called a walking foot go figure okay now i have lined this up i've moved the needle over one place most of your machines now you can move your needle to the left and right i wanted this to sew at 3 8 inch now let me tell you about a walking foot the thing about the walking foot is it isn't going to walk if it's not on your fabric so i can't sew this like this because this foot's just out here in the air it's going to be walking on air and it's going to feed crooked if i just have one foot on it i wish they'd actually make some skinnier walking foots but they don't so lift your needle up arrange your garment i'm sewing on the front of the garment i have that band folded to the back with the seam allowance inside you already saw the other arm all done i thought well i might as well show them the walking foot remember to take little bites when you put your pins in okay so i am going to line this i'm going to line up the edge of the foot right here on the edge of this armhole this foot on the edge of this armhole that's why you got to move your needle to the right or left or you'll have you can have a really wide seam or a skinny seam or whatever but i want mine to be 3 8 inch and so i'm making mine 3 8 inch and i'm going to follow the um 3 8 inch line on my stitch plate all right let's go and i've got it on a three stitch length of three now if i wasn't using this walking foot as i was going around this armhole it would crunch and wrinkle and fold and bend knit wants to be naughty knit wants to be naughty that's why somebody invented all see that see how it walks the top so you're walking on the top and i'm looking at i'm not looking at the needle i'm not looking at this until i get to it and i make sure it's folded under i can't get my thumb on it so i'm sorry i look real crazy right now but i'm looking at this line over here and making sure that i'm lined up with that line you don't ever have to look at your needle your needle is going to go up and down forever and ever and ever you don't have to look at it the only time you look at is if you run out of thread now i need my thumb and i can't use it right now why don't you get a band-aid because i have to go downstairs to get one and then i'll have to go see what jerry's doing and then i'll forget what i'm doing oh yes see see how nice that foot works they're expensive you know these sewing machine companies they they charge you a fortune for the things that go with your sewing machine but you only have to buy it once i've had this for how long have i lived in this house i've had it at least 15 years there used to be a bernina dealership in um frisco texas it's not there anymore and i used to have this lady that managed it and i just loved her she and i got along really really good and i used to go there a lot so anyway i bought this sewing machine there many many years ago and i always buy a walking foot to go with every machine that i buy except that my newest machines my bernina 740s have built-in walking drives even feed foots they're called you know it's a really good thing that you can learn from other people's mistakes i think i should get some kind of an award or something for the person that makes the most mistakes when trying to show people how to do something i was making this top to go with my red leggings i stood right here and made a little bitty video showing you what they look like and it dawned on me i got the top way too short it should be down here instead of up here so i've got my jeans i made on these are my jelly jeans this does not look good with leggings so it's all done number one i messed up the hem remember in my video if you all even watched it um i said i'm going to mark one inch below the purple line well that was the line i wanted to fold the hem up on i should have added another inch past that line i cut on the fold line that's why my blouse is too short it's not too short for jeans though so that's no problem so anyway did i tell you i don't like the fabric this is the fabric i got from fabric wholesale direct bib was right not high quality she said she was real disappointed in what she got from them and i thought this was going to be nicer than it is but it's that kind of cotton see the bubbles in it if you ever poke it if it rubs over a button or a bow or i see see how it holds oh i'm always going like this everywhere on it not good not good it looks like i'm wearing one of jerry's undershirts and i do not like that i do however like my scan and cut design of course i can just cut it out again and put it on a shirt made out of a nicer cotton hopefully i have one here somewhere i'm also not happy with the neckline i put in it so i definitely want to make it again and all i have to do is cut the design out i saved it and i've got enough red i can do it again or i can make it out of a different color but we'll just call this the practice shirt i practiced my scanning cut i found out the fabric is el junco and i've got four more yards with it i might try pressing some of that um that knit interfacing on the back of the next one that i make and maybe it'll do away with this lumpy bumpy stuff here it's fine for doing my shelly exercises do y'all exercise over 50s with fabulous 50s shelly her exercises are amazing and every single one she does different things i don't know how she thinks up all those different moves but i exercise with shelly so i figure this is good enough for exercising with shelly even with the leggings that don't look decent for the public but they're good enough for in front of the tv they stretch better than jeans do so i like my design i made it myself sort of i did not download this design i downloaded um it's not a kit it's not a package a set i downloaded a set of squiggles of all things squiggles i downloaded a set of squiggles one was just like a s some of them are like commas some of them are like apostrophes most of them are very simple but this one actually is this this right here is the squiggle okay so i put it into my canvas workspace and i just duplicated it and duplicated it and duplicated it and duplicated it and then i just turned them and turned them and switched them and turned them all around and i knew that i wanted a long diagonal design you know like you just want to miss america and they hang that ribbon around you oh i could win this bag lady in this shirt okay i do want to make the top again i i'll change it i'll fix the neck and i'll make it longer and i'll do it right next time but i still want to use the design because i'm real proud of myself for inventing it sort of okay my friends i'm sure i've lost 99 of you whoever's left thank you for bearing with me i hope you learned something you know you'll always learn what not to do if you watch my videos i'll be back soon because there's something special i want to tell you about okay has to do with pants and crotches all right bye for now", "3khK_JvnjgA": "we have a lot of competition out there we're just a t-shirt printer but we actually sell our artwork and the HD shirt helps our artwork stand out there's an enormous difference between an HD cotton and some of the competitors we know that better than probably most because we've done a lot of the test printing of the side-by-side printing for fruit of the Loom and the competitive product far and away it's a smoother substrate dollar-for-dollar it outperforms other garments in that same price range customers that are not really familiar with how you print they see a piece of paper that we create on the screen then they print it on the printer at home and they say they love it they expect us to make our print on the t-shirt as good as they print on the paper and that's a very difficult thing when you have a fabric like the HD cotton that is closer to a piece of paper then it is tighter is closer together he's gonna give you a finer print the results from printing on HD cotton have been outstanding we have consumers that are purchasing the product and once they get it wash it wear it they're coming back and saying they loved it and they want it again the fact that the designs are very bright they're very defined the edge detail is excellent it's a product that kind of sells itself your reputation is built on reliability and Trust that means delivering exceptional results with the superior quality of HD cotton the fine gauge yarns tightly knit fabric and high stitch density pull details better to ensure flawless printing save time save money trust HD cotton", "iqT9_oKS9dg": "[Music] hello everyone welcome back to my channel if you don't know me now you know I've been gone for a little while and I really don't have any other excuse other than I'm lazy and I overthink a lot and I think oh I'm gonna do this video and then I'm like nobody's gonna like it I'm not even gonna like it myself and I'm the type of person that I will not rush and do a video and people will know that it's rushed I rather it be slow and precise and take me a while to put out a video even though consistency is key but I'm back on my grind and I'm here with a new video for you guys today and in today's video I'm going to be talking about how I style oversized t-shirts baggy shirts whatever with some of my outfits I have three looks today and I'm going to be showing you how I styled each of the shirts all different colors different outfits that I use to incorporate the shirts into them I really hope you guys enjoyed this video and before we start I would like to say that the black lives matter movement has not finished it's not over with we're not done so go sign those petitions and let's get started so for the first shirt I have this supreme lime green colored one and it's wrinkled because here's a tip when you have supreme shirts you wash them you do not put them to dry because then that's how they get messed up so you let them air dry on a hangers somewhere in your house in front of a fan outside on the clothing rack or whatever just air dry it so that's why it's so wrinkled the shirt system keeps coming off the hangar I'm just gonna take it off the shirt says supreme mind your effing business on the keyboard I think it's fired because it's lime-green it's something simple nobody would notice that it says supreme mind your effing business on it but it does and the little letters on the keyboard I wore it as a t-shirt dress as you guys are gonna see in the montage with my easy seven hundreds because they have that little splash of lime green and some chunky white socks that I like scrunch down I didn't really fold them i scrunch them and I wore my hair and a half up half down so that's what you're about to see that is one way that I've sat on my oversized t-shirts wearing them as a dress is cute especially in the summer because it's hot you can always put some biker shorts under it which is leading to my next outfit and my next outfit I wore a Marvin Gaye t-shirt also supreme one just looks like this with him on it and it's like in this khaki color I guess it's also wrinkled because I had to let it air dry because I already wore it and I styled it with gray biker shorts and I wore also my Easy's again because they went pretty well with the color scheme and I also wore white socks again I like that of it because it's kind of what people call the street wear outfit and if you wear that everyone's always like that's a street wear outfit but I like honey no it's not a Jew wear outfit [Music] back of the shirt it says supreme like a little box logo I feel focus but yeah I worn this with the gray biker shorts and the outfit came pretty well together and I wore my hair in a slick bun I will have these shirt details in the description box below as well as their size and stuff if you're wondering cuz this one is a size medium and the shirt before that I believe it's also a medium and they fit pretty big on me because I'm short so yeah so the last shirt I have is a black supreme shirt in a large it's called the Hellraiser tee it just looks like this kind of scary and then on the back it says supreme and like gothic letters lettering I don't know if you can see cuz it's kind of like black on black which is fire I think black on black always looks fire and I paired this with black ripped jeans that I have from pretty little thing that are like boyfriend jeans cuz they're baggy on me and then I wore my old school vans just regular socks I wore a turtleneck under it and it was a white one so it can just show the detailing or whatever I didn't pair it with any jewelry or anything because I think the outfit just was for itself I also paired it with a little sunglasses just to add to it I had my hair out curly like this the sunglasses were from chien the one that I did in my haul before go check that out if you haven't already and yeah I like this outfit a lot because it's something that I would wear the shirt was baggy the entire outfit was very baggy and it gave me like Billy Eilish advice because you guys know that's all she wears like baggy clothes and it always looks so good on her so I kind of wanted to try it out although it's summer I don't think you would want to be wearing a turtleneck in the summer I did today because it was a little cold outside earlier but once I got home I took right off so yeah and then this is the outfit so that is how I settle those graphic tees you don't always have to wear supreme or anything you can literally get a shirt from Walmart like I had that shirt that I wore my last video from Walmart the oversized IceCube t-shirt that I bleached and it had like that cool bleach effect I think that was fire I was gonna wear that in this video but I just didn't know what to style it with and it wasn't clean and had to be washed so yeah and like I said I'm lazy before so if you guys want me to do more style with me videos on a specific clothing items such as jeans oversized t-shirts biker shorts dresses a specific pair of sneakers anything you guys want I will definitely do that you guys just need to give me feedback and let me know I really hope you guys enjoy this video I'm glad to be back stay safe and have a beautiful day bye guys", "ttZPJxzN4kA": "hi i'm kenny from embroidery library the k polo shirts are popular items to embroider on to i'll show you my method for design placement stabilizing and hoping to get great results picking shirts are cotton or cotton in polyester blend wash and dry the shirt before embroidering on it the template is a printout of a design and it's a good tool for planning where to stitch usually you'll see the top edge of the design about four and a half inches down from the left shoulder seam centered between the button placket and the side scene after the template is where you want to embroider the design mark the center point and the vertical and horizontal access lines those marks help to hoop the shirts straight turn the shirt inside out spray a piece of cutaway stabilizer with temporary adhesive and smooth that on the area that you'll be embroidering turn the shirt right-side out slide the outer hoop inside the shirt press the top hoop in place lining up the marks on the shirt with the marks on the hoop roll the excess shirt up and use clips to keep it out of the way attach the hoop to the machine and load the design move the hoop so the needle is right over the center point embroider the design I use a size 11 or 75 11 embroidery needle when embroidering on Piquet after embroidering turn the shirt inside out and cut the excess stabilizer away that looks pretty good but sometimes when I'm embroidering on a light-colored shirt like this one I can see a ridge from the stabilizer if you see that try a softer more pliable kind of cutaway stabilizer this is a no-show mesh and it's thinner and more flexible than what I was using i embroidered another light blue shirt with the same design but this time I used the no-show mesh cutaway stabilizer now there's no Ridge from the stabilizer when I choose designs for Piquet polo shirts I tend to choose lighter and simpler designs anything too heavy or detailed will drag the fabric down or ripple after being laundered this shirt features a one-color deer design it's light and open and the fabric drapes very well a frosty mug is a great choice for home Wars and beer aficionados this shirt with a club is perfect for cart parties and poker night it's a very simple three color design this design is 3.85 inches wide and it fits nicely on this size large shirt

And also just a little side note, the T-Shirts that I design in this video, right when I publish this video they'll be available on my website for you to order. I do free shipping anywhere in the U.S. International shipping available, so if you like what I design here today, you can get yourself one. But anyway, let's get into this T-Shirt design! All right, so let's design a T-Shirt! It all starts with a pencil sketch, I had zero plan going into this. Sometimes the best stuff comes out when you just sit down and start drawing and see what happens. And yeah, that's what I did on this one. I'm just using some graphite pencils on some Bristol paper, the paper's 19 inches by 24 inches. I actually was, (I) usually draw on 14 inch by 17 inch paper, but I was like, all out at my shop, so I just decided to draw real big, and I feel like the bigger I draw, sometimes the better it turns out. I like a lot of space. I have a really hard time staying on one piece of paper, always. I always need to like, stitch two pieces of paper together. But yeah, this is just kind of like, turning into this sort of, warrior archer woman, and I think she's pretty cool. Yeah, so then the next step is to start inking the drawing. I'm using Faber-Castell-India Ink pens and, I'm using the super fine tip. The 1.5 millimeter bullet nib, and the brush nib. I start with the super fine tip and do the whole drawing just the the slim line art. Ink that whole thing, and then I end up going back over it with the broader brushes on areas where I want it to pop out, and have more weight to the lines, and some more depth. Inking the drawing is always just a tiny bit nerve-wracking because, you know, it's so permanent now. No erasing this, so, gotta be careful with it, and sometimes I take a sketch, and then photograph the sketch, and then ink it digitally; which you know that, that command-z, you can always undo, but I feel like the look of an actual hand-drawn, hand inked piece is, ends up being a little bit better. And then at the end of the project, I have like, this original ink drawing that I can sell as a piece of original art. People seem to like 'em, and I like 'em. So, that's the, that's the plus side of actually inking it in real life; in the real world, existing, analog. Alright, so, I finished my drawing, and now I need to photograph it, so that I can bring it into Photoshop. This paper that I drill on is like, way too big for me to scan it, because I don't have a scanner this big, so I'm gonna photograph it with my Sony A6500, edit it, and we'll turn it into some black and white line art, so that we can start coloring it. Yeah-ah! Alright, so we just took our pictures, let's go ahead and launch Lightroom, Adobe Lightroom, and pop these pictures open, edit 'em up a little bit. We're gonna go ahead and hit 'Shift' 'Command' 'I' to go to our import photos. These are the ones we want. Click import. We'll go over here to this develop tab. I don't know, that one looks pretty straight on. Let's check out a few of these other ones. Yeah, let's go with this one. So, first thing we're gonna want to do is go to our white balance right here, and just click in the white area and that will make it so that it's kind of white balance corrected. I'm gonna bump up my exposure a little bit here, I'm gonna grab my crop tool here, and just crop this a little closer. Let's turn off this lock so that we can crop it however we want. I like to leave a little space around the edges so that when I bring it into Photoshop, I can kind of straighten it up. Go ahead and hit 'Enter' to crop that, and then we're gonna go to white slider. Boost up the whites a bit, and boost up the blacks. Whoops, boost, boost down the blacks. Bump that contrast up, lose a little bit of the shadows. Awesome, so that's, that's looking pretty good right there. We're gonna edit this some more in Photoshop, so, let's go ahead and go to 'File' and choose 'Export', and we'll call this one \"The Archer.\" And, I want to export it as a Photoshop document: PSD because I'm going straight into Photoshop with it, and I'm gonna export it at 600 dpi. And that's pretty much everything that I need to do there, I'll go ahead and click 'Export', and I can quit Lightroom at this point. Okay. So once we have Photoshop open, we're gonna go find that file. Alright, first thing I want to do is; I want to make sure that this is pretty straight, so I'm gonna create a new layer here, grab my shape tool, right now it's said to be a rectangle, we want it to be a rectangle. I'm gonna change the color of the shape, just whatever, can be pink, and then I'm gonna make a rectangle that's about the size of my paper. Now, on the rectangle layer here, we want to go to 'Opacity' and change that to like 40%. This is a guide for us, so that we can make our drawing kind of straight. Let's unlock this layer; click right there, and then we're going to hit 'Command' 'T' to go into Transform Mode, and then right click and choose 'Skew', and we're just gonna skew this so that the edges of our paper match up to this rectangle's (edges), because it's really difficult to photograph the art like perfectly straight on. So we're just doing small adjustments. You want to choose the photo that looks the most straight on, but then go in and do these little adjustments. You're trying to get it pretty close to the edge of that, of that rectangle that we made. I usually like to go just beyond the borders of it. Cool, and then we'll hit 'Enter' to commit that. Awesome, we can lose this rectangle. And now I'm gonna go ahead and kind of just, crop out this gray wall. Awesome! Now, we're gonna want to make our drawing bigger. So if we hit 'Option' 'Command' 'I', it'll bring up our image size menu, and right now our resolution is at 600, and we want to make sure that 'Resample' is unchecked, and we're gonna drop this down to 300. Because we split the resolution in half, it made our image overall bigger so now it's 11 inches by 15 inches. For printing, you don't want your resolution to be any lower than 300 dpi, though. The maximum print size of a T-Shirt is 15 inches by 20 inches with the company that I use, so I'm gonna actually increase this. I'm gonna turn back on 'Resample', and then I'm gonna go to 'Preserve Details 2.0' because Photoshop has a good algorithm if you want to like, increase the size of your image without making it look all janky, and I'm just going to go ahead and bump this up to 20. So now we're at 14.651 by 20 (inches). Just want to make this like, a decent size image. So I'm clicking 'Ok' here. Alright, so now we want to make this pure black and pure white. So I'm gonna go to 'Image' and choose 'Adjustments' and then choose 'Levels.' So this end is like, the white slider and this end is like the black slider, so we'll start sliding this down until we lose, 'till it's basically like, pure white. We'll slide this up to bring the blacks back in. So now, we've got a little bit of kind of, shadows going on down here, and this area is starting to get too light, so I'm gonna go and grab the bottom half of my image with the 'Selector' tool here, actually, probably like the bottom third, and hit 'Command' 'X', and then hit 'Command' 'V' and we've got this pasted on a new layer. So we can just line these back up. So now on this layer, let's go back to 'Image' and choose 'Levels' and just make that white really white. Click 'OK'. Let's make sure these seams are okay from doing that. Yeah, so we've got a little bit of jaggedness, so let's just adjust this layer a bit. There we go. Now it's back where it needs to be. So now we're gonna hold down 'Shift' on our keyboard and click the other layer so now they're together, and we'll just go ahead and merge these back together. And now what we want to do is, we're going to get rid of the white background. I made another video on this on my YouTube channel, I'll link to it right here. But we're gonna hit 'Command' 'A,' 'Command' 'X' to cut it. Then we're gonna hit 'Q' on our keyboard. 'Command' 'V.'' We're gonna hit 'Q' again, and now we want to hit 'Shift' 'Command' 'I' to invert our selection, and then we're gonna hit 'Shift' 'F5' to fill that selection. We're gonna choose black. Okay, so now we have just our black lines here on a transparent background. We can drop in a white background. They say you shouldn't really like, work too long on a white background because it's bad for your eyes, but I'm gonna do a white background because I want to. So now we're ready to start coloring. We're gonna hit 'W' on our keyboard to get the Magic Wand tool. Make sure 'Contiguous' is checked. We're gonna click outside of our character, and it should select everything outside the character. But certain areas like this bowstring it stopped the selection because there's like, a black line. So we need to hold down 'Shift' and click these areas to add them to our selection. Cool. Now that we have the outside of the character selected, we are gonna go ahead and hit 'Shift' 'Command' 'I'. That's gonna invert our selection. But that selection is just outside the black lines and we want them to be in the middle of the black lines. So we're gonna go to 'Select', choose 'Modify' and 'Contract'. I already have mine set to 3 pixels. That should work. So we're gonna create a new layer here for our colors. Then we're gonna hit 'G' on the keyboard to pull up our paint bucket tool. Then click inside the character to fill it with one solid color. Then 'Command' 'D' to deselect. Alright, so now it's time to start coloring. I'm actually gonna speed things up a little bit here, so it's not like a 4 hour video. I made a full in-depth tutorial on how to color a drawing and shade a drawing in Photoshop. I'll link to that video right here if you want to know how to color your drawings in Photoshop, but I will show you this: when you're designing a T-Shirt, sometimes it's helpful to work within Pantone colors because those are the screen print ink colors that T-Shirt companies use. So if you go over to your color picker here, and then you click on this little button that says 'Color Libraries', that shows you all the different Pantone colors. And usually when I'm designing a T-Shirt, that's kind of the color picker that I work in, so that I can provide my T-Shirt company with the Pantone numbers so that the colors that they print are exactly what I designed with. So I'm trying to limit my palette here to just 6 colors. When you do screen printed t-shirts, each color that you add ends up costing you more money. So, it's kind of cool doing screen printing stuff, because you have to limit yourself, and like, you guys might know if you've seen any of my other videos, like, I love all the colors. I'm like, love colors and I (eat?) super colorful artists. So, working on T-Shirt designs, actually I love it because it really limits me on what I can do, and I try to push these 6 colors that I've chosen maybe as far as I can, and really try to do cool color combinations. But yeah, the other thing is, is so there's 6 colors, and then there's black line art, but the black line art I'm gonna print this on black T-Shirts, or like dark grey T-Shirts, so the line art will actually be just the fabric showing through, so that will save me on, on one color. All right, I think that is it. I'm feeling it. It's pretty popping, pretty, pretty spooky. We got some alchemy symbols on the bottom here, got some phases of the Moon that I made. This character's name is Carbon Black, she's the sister of Yuma Black, another character that I made. And yeah, it's gonna be a pretty vivid shirt. *Chuckles* And we're gonna go ahead and, just kind of mock this up on a T-Shirt and see how it looks. Cool, so I got that open. Here's another design I did a while ago. And then we'll just drag this down, kind of get it about to where we want it to be, And then we go back over to our mock-up and there's our design. And then we'll go ahead and just kind of position this where we want it to be, and yeah, yeah, that's looking pretty cool. These mock-ups are pretty rad. And yeah, so now we can kind of see what its gonna look like on a T-Shirt. This is looking sick! What do you guys think, do you like it? So that's cool, so there's the long sleeve, and I think it's looking pretty rad. Haha! It's gonna be a good one! Well, that's it! Just got those ordered. By the way, the T-Shirt company that I order from is called Jakprints, they should be here soon. And actually, these T-Shirts are available right now for pre-order on my website.

Yeah-ah yay!", "H6CAyyFX1EE": "[Music] let's learn how to get nail polish out of anything starting with fabrics whether it's your clothes your bedspread or even your carpet which we all know is the hardest to get rid of nail polish from there's one simple technique and involves hairspray so I always recommend using hairspray before you jump to nail polish remover for a few reasons first of all this isn't going to bleach your clothes your carpet your bedspread anything like that and it helps for the nail polish just to get picked apart when you spray it on here and when it dries you're going to take your tweezers and scrape off all the flecks of dried nail polish then you're going to stick your shirt in the washer and in the dryer and the stain should be completely gone one rule of thumb though if you do take your shirt out of the washer notice the stain is still there repeat this technique now when it comes to your carpet I highly recommend spraying this and scrubbing afterwards that way it really gets you can't wash your carpet okay so go ahead and spray your hairspray let it dry and then scrub and your carpet should be completely clean now you can also use a non acetone nail polish remover but it's really important that it's non acetone because acetone can bleach one rule of thumb is to always test before you use nail polish remover test an inconspicuous area of your clothes or your carpet that way if it does get bleached it's not that noticeable moving on to hair now you might think that it's crazy that you could get nail polishing your hair but don't lie you've all had that moment where you just give yourself a fresh manicure and go to it your scalp and then you have a piece of nail polish in your hair and you're viewing your manicure major bummer but don't freak out all you need is either some oil from your kitchen like coconut oil or even some vegetable oil or you can just grab your conditioner and you're just going to massage it into your hair so once you get it in there you just kind of break it up with your fingernail and what this is going to do is just to help bring the pieces of the polish that's dried out of your hair finally we have the dreaded polish stain on leather whether it's your favorite handbag or your couch this is the easiest way to do it you want to grab a paper towel and saturate it with rubbing alcohol do not use nail polish remover and do not use acetone this will probably bleach your couch or what have you using that rubbing alcohol go ahead and absorb all that excess nail polish while the nail polish is still wet once you have that all soaked up you have the actual stain to deal with and the stain requires a recipe of sorts so you're going to take a 1 to 2 ratio of white vinegar and olive oil you're going to mix them together and then using either a brush a scrubber you know a handbag brush what-have-you dip that in the mixture and just start to scrub this should basically pick apart the nail polish and it's going to start to flake off also because it is leather you do want to give it some TLC so clean it with a leather cleaner and conditioner afterwards as well and that my friends is how you get nail polish out of anything whether it's your carpet your clothes or your favorite piece of furniture [Music]", "95zSD42waiE": "[Music] hey everybody and welcome back hope everyone's having a great day what am i going to be up to i'm going to be doing the 100 shirt challenge and if you don't know what that is i'll be putting a whole lot of shirts on the body and seeing how close to 100 i can get so got one down 99 to go let's put this hair up because that's gonna be the first thing to get in the way i got a whole lot of it all right i figured start with like the tighter tank tops first get those out of the way oh definitely bringing me back to my middle school days where we layered everything literally tank tops under short sleeves and all that lovely stuff oh i don't even know how many tank tops i have right now definitely starting to feel restricted i got let's see one two three four four down this is gonna be number five these tank tops are super super tight oh geez i hope i made a right first starting with these because oh i already can't breathe it's like getting a giant hug oh geez okay we got this i didn't think i would have 100 shirts but apparently i have close to it i stole some from my mom so hey thanks for helping me out with the shirts oh yeah definitely this definitely is a look oh yeah so i think it should be getting close to 10 now hopefully all right i'm probably gonna lose track a lot one two three four five six nine this is number 10. 10 down a lot more to go oh i missed a strap oh no okay 10 down oh yeah definitely looking fabulous right now yeah let's put on another 10.

arms oh okay this would be 45 shirts oh five more shirts and then i'll be at 50 and then we'll see how much motion i have number 50. i think i've been trying to keep up with it oh what do you think come here oh let's see if i can even pick up my daughter come here yeah turn around come here you're a lot heavier with 50 shirts on can you say hi [Music] is mommy being silly what did mommy do yeah oh oh picking up a two-year-old's a lot heavier oh with 50 shirts on i have like that's that as far as my arms are growing yup they're not going higher i can still reach my back so that's good i i

like i can't get my arms up enough to take it off oh no there's like no possible way okay i'm going to be calling in reinforcements which is my mother because this is no way i can't like no way this is what you do when you do silly things oh god that's one that's two i think i got 50 oh that's three no okay i hope i can get them up getting them on was a lot easier is this funny yes it is very funny oh god if i know it was this easy to restrict a child i showed it years ago oh what am i doing with my life that's not the top shirt oh geez i cannot this shirt this shirt grab this shirt there we go okay so i made it to 50. if anybody wants to try to get higher than me tag me in the video let me know see if you can beat me that was just down to the last 10. definitely an arm workout jeez jeez i'm starting to be able to breathe again oh i don't know if it was all those shirts or just these tank tops that helped the not breathing but oh geez that was terrible it was like getting a really big unwanted hug for really really awkwardly long and you can't do anything about it i can't take these off normal they're so tight i don't remember them being this tight and the last one okay and they're all lost now oh so i did it i made 50. oh jeez i was like super restricting on my arms i could not breathe well now as i shove these all in boxes now and wait until the day that they get unpacked if they get unpacked i will see you next week you", "EA3ihrlbTVc": "okay this is our first tutorial on the subway fix 100% cotton fluid application as you can see here we're using 100% cotton building on that piece right there and we are using 50/50 on the second piece the tools you'll be needing is a foam roller small to apply the fluid of course a spray bottle with the fluid as well so what I'm doing here is I am going to mark our fabrics so we don't get them confused at 50/50 and 100% cotton our heat press temperature should be set at three hundred and eighty five degrees Fahrenheit press time should be 70 seconds which is a minute and 10 seconds I'm going to apply the fluid you could use a bottle that it came in or you can use your own spray bottle I recommend purchasing a good spray bottle so you can apply it evenly in this case I'm going to spray it and what you do is you roll it on from left to right and up and down so the fluid gets inside the the cones I'm going to spray it again spray enough so you know it's saturated very well now we're doing the spray process now as we go along however you can spray your fabrics ahead of time so you can spray the area that you're going to be pressing on only so you don't waste much fluid in areas that you're not going to press and you could a pretreat that shirts ahead of time so you can pretreat 5 10 12 shirts ahead of time and allow them to dry for a day or so or however long you want to keep them the fluid does not expire on the fabric so in this case to advance the drying process I'm going to slide it into the heat press for about five to seven seconds and then that way off it'll allow it to dry as you can see there's steam coming up which that just means that it's allowing the fluid to dry seems fairly dry I'm going to press here shortly onto the fabrics so you can see the outcome okay so we are now ready to press 5050 100% cotton on the sub we cut premium sublimation paper at three hundred and eighty-five degrees one minute 10 seconds medium pressure now remember that when washing it has to be washed in cold water cold temperature and it's recommended that you inform your customer how it needs to be washed and there is the outcome of 100% cotton and 50/50 if you notice the ink release on this paper it's at about 90% I would say so very little ink left on this sublimation paper and there's the outcome very vibrant colors on both as you can see a hundred percent cotton actually looks better than the 50/50 and that right there is how you use the sub leg sublimation fluid you can order it at sublimation cut calm you could also join our facebook page at sub the cuts at facebook.com forward slash sub with cuts and you could also purchase our paper on our website okay so these are the two samples that I had printed and pressed using the subway fix 100% cotton fluid as you can see you lost very little to no ink during the wash I did wash it in cold water as recommended and this is the results for the 50/50 you can see some of the ink it Edgeley from the sharpie kind of faded into the fabric but this is there is also the 100% cotton as you can see curled up in the dryer or the quality of the print actually stayed on as intended once again this is a little bit over 18 hours which is what I waited to wash as recommended and cold water and this is the final results you can get the subway fix fluid at www.and cuts calm you could also get the paper that I used which is the sub cuts premium sublimation paper on a website as well thanks for watching stay tuned to other products coming soon", "INVK4pupjPM": "hi guys is crystal welcome back to my channel today what we're gonna do is we're gonna test out the sublimation so you guys know in the previous video it wasn't this one but these ones we already printed these on t-shirts right so I had a question which that was something I've asked - can these be reused so I have seen another youtuber do it and it came in a little bit lighter so I thought you know for when this was done what Monday I think so it's been about a week but what four or five days ago I guess if you will so it's been sitting here as well so I want to go ahead and test it out to see but I didn't want to waste some of the good shirts that I have so today I went to Walmart and picked these up so these are by the yard I love how they're doing this I don't know if they're doing this in your at your local Walmart but what ours now they have these hanging and they're already pre-cut for you but you could always get some cut so this one right here is y of poly cotton so this one here is 65% poly and 35% cotton so I wanted to try it out as well if you were gonna be doing a blended shirt and then this one right here was a hundred percent polyester and they were both this almost two dollars and I think this one was about 270 so they were pretty affordable so what I would do is maybe grab you some of these so that way you can have it as your test pieces so these are now gonna be our test pieces when we do stuff whether you want to test out a design to see how it's working or different fabrics so I thought it would be great just to kind of try it on each one so let's go ahead and get started so this is another one that I just did the other day with another shirt know that I'm just now getting into the sublimation so I'm kind of learning some stuff I noticed when I press this last year I'm seeing like this square around it we've seen it in my colored shirt which I think was the image that I brought in it had a white background and I think that's what happened I figured out on this one for this one you can see these wrinkles here where the press has kind of like pulled on this I have my pressure way too high so you want a very light pressure where it's just basically you could it's real easy to pull that down you can pull it back and forth so we've changed my pressure too so we can make sure that's correct so just wanted to mention that now and I did take my other shirts home but we can compare the vibrancy of this one today when we do those test cuts let's do it now the test cuts the test prints so let's go ahead and do the poly first and I'm not gonna cut this or anything I'm gonna keep the thing hold so I can always use it to do my tests here so let's see how thick this is because I'm not too sure it seems okay I mean it maybe I'm a little bit on the thinner side hmm but we're just gonna roll with it it's not a percent polyester it's on the thinner side but we're gonna check it out you can see the difference because you can't see through like this one right here compared to this one you guys can hopefully see that you can really see through that but we're just gonna try it anyways so the thing we want to make sure is let me switch you guys over to my other camera one thing that I've decided to do with the top of my heat press I've seen other youtubers doing so what I did was I took my Teflon sheet here and I did these magnets so these are super strong magnets and I just got it held on so what I did was I put the Teflon sheet on here first I closed it so that way it was flat on it I brought my size up put the magnets and that's how I did it so that way I can always make sure that I have my Teflon sheet just because that's something that I'm gonna have a hard time remembering to put that on to protect my platen because of my easy press so I've already got that on there with a magnet and I'm gonna just always leave it so we're just gonna see how it works now I'll have to figure out where I ordered these because I can't really remember I'll have to go back and some of my videos or just look through my emails where I ordered I think I got it either off of Amazon or Ebay and it came with like three or six sheets for like five bucks tops it was it was quite I've had him for a while now so let's go ahead and get started so the thing we need to remember is to put down the parchment paper on the bottom and then we'll put down our poly here so we're gonna start out with a polyester and like I said these designs have already been used and I want to get over here on the corner here and I'll have to hold one side because it's gonna be long an idea that my aunt had was to take this fabric if it does work out is to make it to where I could turn it into a pillow so that way I could free can use this design so I'm probably gonna move this over enough to where if it does work I can maybe use it as a pillow we'll see so that I could then cut the fabric down so anyways I've already got the parchment paper I've got this now you want to pre-press so we're gonna do what we normally would with a shirt I don't you have to cut this down eventually because this may be too long to be trunk like this I'd recommend cutting it down not leaving it long just cuz it's such a big thing to mess with it's gonna be falling and so you just want to give it a press for just a little bit to take out some of that moisture and to get it real smooth so I'm gonna do at this point and smooth that out just a little bit I'm gonna pop on the image and like I said we've already done this one before we're just checking to see if you can reuse the same paper so maybe get two uses out of it and they've got it at 385 and I'm gonna do 60 seconds so I've got it on there got the first my paper cut it down I'm gonna push it back in and I'm gonna go drop this for 60 seconds I'm hoping this angle is a little bit better for you guys because you can now see the Machine a little bit better when I watch this back when I edit if it works out I'll leave the camera like this whenever I bring it in each time if not I'm probably going to try to find something to stand this camera on to get a little bit of a better angle with the heat press because this is something we're gonna be working with now a lot on the channel now that doesn't mean I will still be using the easi press for the people that have the EZ press as well as I do love it and I'll be using it for my own projects but now I'll have the heat press to incorporate as well so I did talk to heat press nation today and these will be the same as the 15 by 15 these are going to be in the first week of December so and they did say that you can pre-order so if you do want to preorder now to make sure that you do put your name on one you can pre-order they recommend it at least doing it maybe a week before they think there's gonna be plenty enough for everyone but just to make sure you do it a week before Christmas alright so that's what I'm gonna do on that 15 by 15 I'm going to peel this off we're gonna pull it out we're gonna see if it worked so we're just gonna chop it up and it did so I'm quite impressed so for you guys that wonder if you can reuse these I'm really shocked so you can look how vibrant that came out so that's not bad at all so let's go bring it over here and kind of review next to the other one I won't be able to do it with the others let me bring our back over here I won't be able to do it with the other ones I won't be able to compare it with the other designs just because like I said I've already taken those shirts home but I want to show you really quick how well this came out so yes you can reuse these so there we go there's the one that we just did and then the shirt that I put it on just so you can see and this is a hundred percent polyester here's the one that I did it on so you can see it just comes in a little bit more vintage I really love it this is not yellow behind it by the way this is just because of the table underneath you can see my hand here so there's no yellowing and or anything like that that's just because of how thin this fabric is now you could reap it this on a t-shirt the point of this is just so it's a scrap so I'm not wasting t-shirts because if this wasn't didn't work out of wasted a t-shirt I've ordered a bunch of t-shirts online so we'll have a bunch more here pretty soon so I'll zoom you in so maybe y'all can see a little bit better so here's the one we did today here's the one I did the other day it's kind of maybe spread those out so you can see it just more of like a vintage look not too bad I really like that let's press the same edge image one more time just to see if we could do it a third time I'm quite impressed y'all alright and like I said I could use that on a pillow I can now turn that into a pillow so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna move this down a little bit further just to give me a little bit of space in case I decide I am going to use that for a pillow so I'm just using it down a little bit here just like that and we're gonna try to now press this for a third time so I'm gonna push it in and give it a pre press hopefully this is gonna stay still because like I said this is kind of long I definitely wouldn't recommend keeping the fabric all in one just one long sheet so just doing a quick pre-press popping that up gonna bring it out I'm gonna try to leave it so I'm not moving a little bit so once again we're taking that same image here we're gonna pop it and you can see what it looks like so far just got a little bit lighter let's try it for a third time just like that you know I think straighten that up just a little bit more just to make sure everybody's on the flat underneath and close it 466 now probably gonna go and put this in fast forward motion so you guys aren't always just setting here for 60 seconds alright well then we're gonna take it out of here and let's see what happen I'm gonna carefully pull this out and I'm gonna pull it back and it did so it just came in just a little bit lighter again so I'm gonna bring it over here so we can do a comparison real quick alright so first shirt that I did the other day so I'm gonna scoot it over as far as I can in the camera view here first shirt that's the first image all right and let's go ahead and do it kind of worked out perfect the way it's gonna line up here so this is all 100% polyester except for this one's actually 90 and then 10% spandex I believe so first image second image third image it's gonna come in again but it's gonna come in way lighter so that's a way more washed out than TG look if you're into that I do love stuff like that so it don't bother me so three different times so far we've got that out of it so let me go ahead and zoom y'all in so y'all can see a little bit better as we go through these so first one second one you can see how much that one is and then the third one here so this is what we've got out of the third one so there it is I'm really completely impressed guys I'm really impressed okay so the next test that we're gonna do we're gonna have to take another image because we want to start like we did for the beginning so this time we're gonna try it if you were gonna do it on a literature so this one's 65 cotton polyester 50% or whatever it was hold on guys where'd it go this one this one is 65% poly 35% cotton so this was if you're gonna be doing a blended so let's try now this one I did not do one with the other day this was one I did for my aunt let's try let's see we're gonna either do the truck cows or discount I think want to try this cow in case I do like it I'll put it I'll turn this into a pillow as well so I'm gonna try this one on here and see what happens so let's go ahead and switch over I'm gonna go ahead and get our parchment paper down always make sure you didn't get any ink on them before you reuse them you don't wanna mess nothing up so I'm just gonna go ahead and get this fabric on here if that on there just enough space in case I do do this is for a pillow and then this one is gonna go on here just like advance or let me pre-press sorry guys we're gonna go to repress this I'm trying to make sure my fabrics up here like I said I would not leave this long if you're gonna use them for pillows definitely cut your pillow down so let's go ahead and pre-press this to get out those lines and any type of moisture alright that should be good alright we're gonna back it up just a little bit I'm gonna go ahead and we're gonna put that cowl in there so remember this is after it was already done one time I can't compare to the shirt like I said cuz I already took it home I'll try to insert an image here or whenever we get over to the thing I'll try the insert image I'm gonna bring that down for soup I almost messed that up make sure that you get down your parchment paper and once again make sure there's no inks you don't want it to get on your Teflon sheet because if it does it's gonna ruin it you'd have to just get a new one all right 60 seconds I'll fast forward this all right I'm gonna pop it up let's see what happened we're gonna pull this off carefully pull this out and we're gonna peel this off and this is the blended so if you were gonna be doing a blended it's gonna be like now on this one I did get a little bit of yellowing around it I went the full 60 seconds you can do 45 so I'm thinking with the cotton this blend here I'll probably drop it down to that 45 just a tip for me on that one but look how good that looks I think that looks amazing and that's gonna be a super cute pillow so I'm definitely gonna turn this into a pillow so let's go ahead and try it for a third time and just see what happens I'm not gonna take you over to the other camera because there's no point because there's not going to be a shirt to compare it to I'm gonna go ahead and pop this back up here one more time I'm just leaving enough space so when I cut this down which I will do a video on or make sure there's enough space for me to cut for my pillow so I'm gonna go ahead and get my fabric up here so it's not gonna mess up carefully push this in so I don't lose and we're going pre-press again so this is what it looks like after the second time still looks pretty good like I said I'm pretty impressed that we can reuse these but this one definitely got to get a little bit yellowing oh I don't need to pre-press that one so I've probably already yellowed it before I even started so this time I'm gonna try to drop my time down to 45 seconds and see if that does help so I'm gonna go ahead and put this on well yes I'm gonna put this on here go ahead and get my parchment paper down all right and then I'm gonna change my tights and I hope that's enough time to really process those inks but like I said it did give me a yellowing so we're gonna see if it does this time all right pop that it and we're going to pull this off we're going to carefully pull this out and now we're gonna go ahead and pop it off and see what happened so it looks cute again so this is what the paper looks like for the third time and this is what we got I think it looks good it definitely came in way lighter but I think could still make a really cute pillow but I definitely think the second image came in just as good as the first so I don't think this is about at all I love the washed out look too but so far like I said three times I don't know what the fourth times looks like but I don't think that I would be as happy as just leaving it alone probably at this point but I will say I did not get the yellowing around when I dropped my time to the 45 but it still kind of makes me wonder if I would have left it for the 60 seconds if it would have gave me maybe a little bit more of a better image but I kind of doubt it but it would've gave me the yellowing again all right I'm gonna bring you guys back down here so this is what we've done today and once again this is pretty see-through so it's kind of a you're gonna maybe see it looks a little bit darker under here but anyway so there is the poly blend and then these may be a little bit sideways for you to see but at least err on here so I'm gonna scoot this over so you guys can see everything and then here is the ones that we did on the polyester so whether you're doing a poly blend shirt or whether you're doing a head a percent polyester it's gonna work either way so can you reuse these yes and we saw so far each image that we use is three times once on the shirt twice on here and this will be great to reuse those four pillows like I said you could sell those in your shop sell them at the craft fairs instead of thrown on that paper way and wasting it this paper cost me two dollars and I could probably get let's say one two let's say I got three pillows out of this so and then same with the polyester say I got about you know four or five pillows because it's a little bit bigger so something to do with those or put them on a shirt I would definitely put that on a shirt and I would be happy with that so same thing with this one I think it's super cute I hope you guys enjoyed this if you did please hit the like button down below and subscribe and I'll see you on the next one", "D0j40NcDgnQ": "hi everyone welcome back to my channel today I'm showing you four ways you can up side shirts that are too small on you now let's get started this first one is super fast and requires no sewing all you have to do is cut a slit down the middle of the neckline cut off the sleeves and cut slits up the sides of the shirt the slits are going to loosen up the tightness around the belly and chest and the tank will get rid of the tightness around the arms you can have fun with your tank top and cut it into any design you like for this next shirt Lily already cut off the arms and neckline but needs help making it fit looser around the body the first thing I'm going to do is cut all the way up the sides of the shirt and through the bottom of the armhole then I found another gray t-shirt that matched as close as possible in color and I cut out the backside of the shirt that had no design on it next decide how much fabric you want add it to the sides of the shirt I'm cutting out a piece that is six inches wide if you want to keep the bottom hem of the shirt make sure to measure from the bottom up lay the shirt next hit a six inch piece and trim away the extra fabric for this part don't trim it exactly to line up with the armhole give yourself some extra space just in case things don't line up when you sew it then I folded the six inches and cut it in half to make two three inch panels we're adding two inches to the sides of the shirt take the strip and sew it right sides together to the front of the shirt and then sew the other side right sides together to the back side of the shirt start sewing from the bottom of the shirt so that the hem lines match up I'm also using a stretch stitch and a ballpoint needle lastly I cut the armholes lower and trimmed more of the neckline for the next shirt since the design is really close to the neckline I don't want to risk ruining the design so I'm going to do is cut out the entire graphic design and separate it from the shirt make sure to leave a half inch seam allowance around the edge as you cut next I bought a new black t-shirt from Walmart and I'm going to sew the graphic design on to the new shirt like a patch make sure to pin the design in place with a lot of pins so that it doesn't move while you're sewing where this last year we're going to be adding some batwing sleeves and the first thing you want to do is cut a straight line from the bottom up to the shoulder soon so that the armhole is completely gone next I bought one yard of black stretch fabric from Walmart and I'm going to create some batwing sleeves to add on lay the shirt on the fabric and measure out how much space you want added to the sides of the shirt I measured out five inches then I drew a straight line where the shirt is that and next I continued a line from the shoulder seam straight across this line is your sleeve link next draw a curved line for the batwing sleeve and stop five to six inches below the top line and then connect the lines to finish the sleeves cutout for sleeves and then sew two pieces right sides together along the shoulder seam next match up the two shoulder seams and sew the shirt and sleeve right sides together lastly so the underarm seam right sides together repeat the same thing to the other side and you're finished have fun with your design and feel free to add whatever you want if you want to hem the shirt for a more finished look go ahead or if you want to just leave it then it'll be fine as well thank you guys so much for watching I hope some of you try these out and if you do please share of me on instagram or twitter using the hashtag cooler but also check out my other t-shirt reconstruction videos for more awesome ideas see you next time", "VD8rwxE76mk": "what's going on everybody is Milton from the blood journey and I just wanted to make a video in a compare shirt space and TSC apparel those are the main two places where I get my blank shirts from to do my screen printing the only difference is shirt space you do not need a recent relations in TSE you do the reseller license but I wanted to compare the two and give you the price breakdown that maybe can help you now or in the future so let's get started okay so a shirt space this is where I've been using for a while now until I think around March or April how to use some tea Etsy apparel but sure space you do not need a reseller license and usually either I get to go the Gildan G 200 or the G 5000 which it's a little bit lighter our customers prefer the G 5000 to be honest with you so if you look right here the white ones always cost less wherever you buy your shirts from White's always cost less so the color wants comfort little more so let's do black small through extra-large the price is usually the same 2x 3x and so on the price increases so you have to keep that in mind when you are doing your pricing when you're asking customers hey do you want to X 3x you have to keep that in mind and know that certain shirts cost more right so keep that in mind so you don't lose that much profit so let's say let's go with black and let's do a hundred medium it's just for the example so we added that to the cart now let's go to tse TSE I feel that they have a little bit more of a variety and they also have a tool text which is one of my favorite shirts to use a little bit softer then gilded so they have a lot more variety here than shirt space and let's do the exact same thing this looks to category and brands is put a guilty and let's do tilting 5,000 and we are going to pick black and this is one of the things that I like about TSE up-arrow is that they have different warehouses all over the country and so you pick the one that's closest to you because normally comes the next day and also it tells you the amount they have in each warehouse so you can you can pick another place if you ask the right so let's go right here and put in 100 medium and this add it to the cart so let's go back to shirt space and let's go to the cart as you can see the subfloor right is free shipping after W $100 so it is coming out to a total of 266 so 266 for shirt space okay so back to TSE apparel here in the car the subtotal is 206 after $200 it is free shipping so if we go to checkout and it's here with text and everything's gonna come out with 210 49 so there you have it it's 210 40s C 266 for search space so there you go the comparative search base versus TSE and this is why we're using TSE more and more and more every single day and again you do need a reseller license and once you start getting orders in the Moors you do there is resellers license that's gonna help you when you do your taxes and all that so remember when you're doing the orders and you are charging people you need to charge taxes because you have to pay for taxes at the end of the year there you go I hope this video helps in choosing a better company that can help you save money so even though they're the the church are cheaper just by cents it adds up so a hundred shirts our search space is two hundred and sixty-six and Auntie SC is two hundred and ten till it's almost about $56 difference so there you go guys I hope this helps and hope you have a blessed day a blessed week have a blessed life", "EHewzZTdZZE": "what's up guys so I just got in the mail some sample t-shirts so a lot of people do print on demand t-shirts right but I've never actually been super involved with selling t-shirts but if you don't know yet I have a Shopify app that sells print-on-demand items and I got a lot of requests for custom printed t-shirts so what this video is is I'm gonna go through some of my samples the anvils the the guild ins the American Apparel's all all the different types of t-shirts and we're gonna see the quality I'll take a video of me wearing it and we're gonna see which one I like the best maybe I'll add one into my app maybe I won't I don't know yet but this is a quick video you can just check the quality so you know is it worth selling the eleven dollar t-shirt versus the a fifty dollar t-shirt verse the six dollar t-shirt what's the difference how's the quality and all that kind of stuff okay so stay tuned and let's get started with the business [Music] what's up guys so we have this is the doesn't say I have to open it but we got one two three four five different shirts that I'm gonna go try on right now all the exact same they're black they have the exact same design and I'll show you that right here let's look at that I made this just as a sample little X in the corner right I just wanted to see how these shirts feel now I tried this one on first this is an anvil this is an anvil let's see that focuses there you go and bill upside down backwards toner and it actually is a really nice shirt I'll show you that in a second the next one we have is let's open all these little thing this is the canvas Bella and I'm not sure if this has a number canvas Bella now this one doesn't feel as nice as the anvil I actually like the anvil I'm feeling better but we have that one the same exact design here let me take that sticker off okay and let's open the next one so here's a Gildan the Gildan ones are the cheapest I think these are like six dollars and on some some apps and maybe 850 I'm like printful or something but this is a Gildan and I know there's a couple different style Gilda's there Gildan like different numbers of model numbers of gilding not sure what this one is because I don't think this has the model number on it but I'll have to look at my receipt and see what kind of orders I had or what kind of a thing now this feels like this actually feels better than the canvas one better it feels better it's a more pitch black this the canvas Bella actually has some some gray pattern in there I don't it's supposed to be black but I mean I like the look but it was supposed to be pitch black right and I don't know if you can actually tell that on the screen probably not and then let's look at the next one this is another Gildan so this is a different model number Gildan one is the cheaper one and one is the more expensive one I'm assuming no I'm not I'm not positive about that oh this one feels super cheap so this must be the cheap one let's look oh yeah this is definitely a t-shirt that this is a $6 t-shirt it has it's not very soft at all it would not be comfortable I would hear you have to wash this thing like three four times to get it to be soft and put some stuff in your washing machine this feels like a factory t-shirt and let's check out the last one oh this is the American Apparel so we got an American Apparel shirt and this one is instantly a million times more soft than the Gildan one I just had so let's fill it this is the American Apparel so the factory t-shirt Gildan I don't like the the Gildan soft style with the yeah so the Gildan soft style is actually really soft the other guild in the factory Gilman is so rough it feels like you would get hives wearing it the American Apparel is really nice and soft the Bella canvas surprisingly is not as soft as I would assumed it saw it's soft but it's not as soft as I would assumed and then the softest one the best so far is this the anvil lightweight it is a super nice t-shirt let me try this one on first so you can see alright so this for this first t-shirt we got the Bella canvas sorry we have the anvil not the Bella canvas and this one actually feels really good I like the way it fits right it it's got a little bit of taper right not too bad and it's got a good length it's not too long the Shamus sleeves or nice you know that not too long not too short feel like it fits my shoulders everything so I really like this t-shirt I would actually wear this t-shirt it was the first time I've been testing these so my first reactions here let's try the next one alright guys so this is the Gildan not soft style this is the one I just said feels like factory it's very very rough against the skin not my favorite but it it it actually fits okay the lengths okay the sleeves are okay shoulders everything's okay right it's not a bad t-shirt fitting wise but I mean just the two seconds I put it on I want to take it off I'm just so let that be a partner this is the normal guild and this is the cheap shirts this is 99% of what everybody sells because they're looking for the most margin when they were running Facebook ads and teespring and all that kind of stuff they're looking for this $6 t-shirt so that they the marketers could actually make the most money but yeah let's check the next one what's up guys so this one is the Bella canvas this one has that little bit of grey in it I'm not sure if I chose a pitch-black one or if I chose the one with the grey I can't remember I got to look but it's got a little bit of grey it feels like it's more fitted than the other t-shirts I don't know if you can see my little bit of low fat here but um it feels pretty good I think it needs to be washed just just soften it up a little bit more whenever I put a brand new t-shirt on I always feel like it's hot I always feel like it's it's not breathing I'm not breathing through it so I don't know gotta wash it a couple times it's not my favorite my favorite is still the anvil one so softest it fits the nicest but let's try the other Gil the soft style Gildan next all right guys so this is the soft style Gillett this one i think is like well on printful I think the normal Gillan was like 850 I think this is like 1050 or 1150 but this one actually for the softbox I Gildan feels better than the Bella canvas the Bella canvas felt more tight maybe I'm just a little bit of fat and I'm gonna lose some weight but this one feels a little bit more loose for me it feels better right this is actually maybe my second favorite one right now I don't know how it looks but it's got good leg cuz the feels it feels comfortable not as thick as the Bella canvas where I couldn't breathe through it or I didn't feel like I was getting enough air flow but this one feels pretty good actually I like this one alright guys so this is the last the last t-shirt I tried on five this is the American Apparel one this one feels pretty good too I actually it's a little bit more tight I don't know if it looks better I can't really tell because I'm looking at the screen right now I'll have to check this video after and just see which one of my favorite and posting the comments which ones do you think makes me look the best or you know there's five t-shirts right which one I look the best in and then yeah hopefully this helps a little bit my lights for clearing so you probably see that probably ought to turn it off it's getting too hot and yeah let me know what you guys think hopefully this helps you know make your decision on what kind of t-shirts you want to send maybe it helps me maybe I'm gonna put one of these brands of t-shirts in my app let other sellers you know we got like 500 sellers now which is crazy you just start it not too long ago so maybe I mean they've been asking for t-shirts and hoodies too even though you can get those same products other places but maybe I'm gonna add something I don't know I'll have to think about it I'll let you guys know so let me know your feedback what do you like and you know what guys I'll see you in the next video [Music] you [Music]", "CT-LC_qhlIU": "hello I'm Catherine from the outdoor duck owk and today we're gonna be taking a look at the best way to wash a down jacket when people do attempt to wash down the most common mistakes are made a natural drying of the jacket rather than the washing part when Dan gets wet it forms into clothes and if they're dried incorrectly it can be ruined so it's vital that the correct care is given so for today's demonstration I'm going to be washing this men's netsy vest from the North Face which is of course available at a outdoor this one's never been washed before so it's about time we gave it a good cleaning so firstly it's important that the right search used normal soaps and fabric softeners we damage the Downs fibers and stopping function correctly there are specialist washing powders available for doubt but we always recommend this this is granny's original pure gentle soap flakes which can be bought at most supermarkets I pick this one up at Tescos this is a fragrance free soap that doesn't contain any harsh chemicals and because it's a pure soap it won't take away the Berbers natural oils so give it a nice gentle wash so prepped our washing machine by doing a small rinse cycle with nothing in there and I've washed out the side drawer just make sure that there's no residue of any laundry liquids that's being used in there before and the forwards have the vest in I'm just going to give it quick rinse in the sink this isn't an essential step but I just want to make sure that any nasty bits down on the outside are washed off before I put it in the machine so the amount of soap you need will vary depending on the size of the jacket you're washing and as I may be doing it fast I've only too much so I'll just put a little less than a handful straight in the tray so now that we've got the vest and the siphon machine we need to make sure we choose the right settings we don't want to be too rough on the down so we need to go for delicate cycle and change the spin to 600 rounds per minute a good temperature to go for is around 30 to 40 degrees I'm going to go for 30 because it's good for the environment and we don't want to put it down in too much heat so now that that's all set up when you just started going and put the kettle on so that's the easy bit done as I said earlier most people make mistakes while actually drying the jacket to maintain the jackets walk you need to ensure that it dries thoroughly and correctly dam has now formed those clamps we talked about earlier and unless we fluff them up while drying it will not recover its loft and insulation properties it is possible to dry down jacket without a tumble dryer this is more easily done in assembling you can air outside if you are air drying the jacket be prepared for a very long process to break up the down traps you'll need to shake it out by hand every 5 to 10 minutes for a good few hours I'm going to dry the nipsey vest in the tumble dryer which is a much easier process as it does most of the shaking for you so now it's in the dryer I'm going to add to clean tennis balls these are a great aid because they'll bounce all around the drum and beat the clumps of down helping to break them up and a bit dry of course if you have dryer balls then you can use that tennis balls are simply a cheaper alternative so now the best intense balls are in the machine you want to select a low heat setting and put it for no more than 20 minutes you don't want to leave it in too long at one consistent heat so we're going to keep coming back to check on it and repeat this process until it's completely dry so now the 20 minutes is up I'm gonna take out and just give it a go over by hand so it helps to lay it flat and just feel for any clumps that's still in the down and when you find them just fluff them out by hand as we did before and then once you've done that to the hole the jacket put it back in the drive of the tennis balls for another 20 minutes and then repeat this step by hand so as you can see the Nazi base is now completely dry and it's recovered its loft really nicely it took a total of four runs through the tumble dryer and the washing and drying took about three and a half hours in total so it's a very lengthy process but it's definitely work to have a nice clean jacket or best buy end of it if you don't feel confident enough to do this yourself and you feel like you might ruin it then by all means take your jackets get professional clean", "QISHsd1GcgI": "hi

and instead we're going to go through something similar yet completely different that's right I'm talking about the cream and to start off well you already don't know what this is based off the title this is of course the Hanes taglish shirt so yeah this is it the most hyped up supreme item or whatever in fact there's no height to these whatsoever but you know I never bought anything from supreme so I just wanted to see what it looked like so let's get started so first off well it came in the mail about a week later after I ordered it and it comes with this this nice bag as we can see here and in my opinion I don't know it's pretty high quality bags it says supreme on it and yeah it's a pretty thick bag I would say it's a 1 but yeah we also get the infant that the really famous supreme sticker supreme is known for these stickers right here so now I got my hands on like two of them which is awesome and then we go on to the actual shirt so as we can see all a bit it says hangs on the top right corner is Monday back comfort guarantee lay flat collar comfort soft t-shirts and it just sets up nothing on the back so for that cream writing right there and yeah all the sizing details supreme blue you're calm you know your usual usual so let's just open this up and I'll show you guys what's inside so now that we have two shirts out of the bag let's take a closer look on the tags and everything and in real life the shirt is darker so just two supreme they're hand come whatever it in india hind' hahaha t-shirts and it does come with three this is great so let's take a look at this right here so the main reason why you would buy this is one because it's a cream and two because it shows right here on the bottle that's right so take a regular hint shirt put the cream on it and boundary looks price so uh that's what the shirt is so you get three of these um in my opinion to run pretty true to size you know you would wear this under like your bombers or whatever I would wear this with like space gems and like Ron Hall but yeah it's a cream you know it's pretty soft and it's not embroided or anything it's just screen printed on I think or heat press or whatever so I yeah that's it for this supreme thing um in terms of costs I mean if you live in the US and believe these cosmic thirty-six dollars you're live Canada you got to pay duties and everything so it goes up to like 80 something canadian dollars and it's not really that worth it but we call it supreme so I guess you guys want it then you buy it otherwise you know if it was a normal hint shirt and we're selling for that price no one would buy it but stick up to cream on it and yeah people actually buy it yeah guys that is my input and my review on these off into cream shirt please comment like and subscribe and stay tuned for more I'll see you guys in the next one", "RDV_hZFOQ4U": "let me introduce you to the secrets for successful dyeing with ripp first of all know your fabrics check the fiber content on the label of the item you plan to die RIT is a user-friendly diet that will color most fabrics including cotton linen and rayon as well as nylons silk and wool it will also die blends up to 60% cotton however it will not die 100% polyester as a guideline we recommend that you use one box of red powder or a half a bottle dye and that will color up to 16 ounces or one pound of dry weight fabric 1 pound of fabric is about the weight of a bath towel 3 yards of cotton broadcloth or 4 ladies medium-sized t-shirts always use hot water in your dye bath ideally it should be about 140 degrees if you think your tap water is not that hot then heat some water on top of the stove and add that to your dye bath another secret to achieving bright intense colors is to add salt or vinegar to your dye bath if your dyeing cotton fabric then we recommend adding one cup of salt if you're dyeing wool nylon or soap then add one cup of white vinegar to your dye bath always pre-wash whatever it is that you plan to die that helps to remove any finishes that may interfere with the dye process we recommend using a liquid laundry detergent that's high in soda ash such as fat you", "qSeAExBElRE":

I'm Antonio Centeno, the founder of Real Men\nReal Style. Today, I'm going to be answering the question\nhow to properly wash a man's dress shirt. If you haven't already, please subscribe to\nour YouTube channel. By doing that, these videos will come right\nto you. If you like this, if you find it useful, I\nwould appreciate it if you would like it right down there below. If you want to get more, if you want my free\n47-page e-book on men's style, that's down there as well, and if you want even more,\nI've got more. It's a 600-page, 400-image, 14-hour premium\ne-book and it's almost like a course. I get people emailing me all the time saying\nit's great. It's not free, but it does support my business\nhere in Wisconsin. It comes with continuous updates and there\nare some bonuses attached to it that you can use on future offers that I'll be having,\nso hint-hint. This is a question that Brian has been asking\nme multiple times via multiple channels, so I have to get to it. I have to admit that I almost felt that it's\nsomething that I thought everybody knew how to do, but apparently people wanted to know\nhow I am cleaning my dress shirts. That's a pretty good question, I guess, because\nmost of my dress shirts are pretty pricey. Well, I get them at a pretty big discount\nbecause I design them and we build them ourselves. How do I deal with dirty dress shirts and\nwhen do I wash them? When do I determine if a dress shirt is dirty? That was something Brian was asking because\nI mentioned that down here in the studio, I've got a few dress shirts that I leave down\nhere and I'll put them on and I'll wear them multiple times because usually I'm only wearing\nthem maybe 30 minutes to a couple of hours each time when I'm down here and then I'll\ntake them off and wear something else when I'm going around the office. Brian is asking, \"Well, how do you determine\nwhen a dress shirt is dirty?\" and I think that's a good question. Usually, I will look around the neck and the\ncuffs. That's where I'll start to see dirt and deposits. It comes right off of your skin, oil and grime\nas you're going through the day, stuff that picks up from the air. That's where I first notice. Occasionally, I will get a coffee stain or\nsomething on there, but most of the time, I start to see a little bit of ring around\nthe collar. Now, how do you determine if a dress shirt\nis dirty? When should you wash one? Why is this important? Why don't you just wash it after every wear? The reason that's important is because think\nof your dress shirt as having a very limited life because it does. Every time you wash that dress shirt, you've\ngot only so many more times you're going to be able to wash it before it falls apart or\nbecomes unwearable. I like to tell guys think that you can wash\nthis dress shirt only 100 times. Now, how many times you can wear it between\nthose 100 washes is up to you. I find that it depends on how much I'm sweating,\nhow long I wear it in the day. If I wear a dress shirt only for a couple\nof hours, I'm going to wear it a few more times. If I wear that dress shirt and I'd be wearing\nit for a 12-hour day and I've been sweating, I can look and I can feel that this dress\nshirt needs to be washed. That's probably the best guidelines I can\ngive you. If you're an architect working outside down\nin Florida there in the summer, you're going to want to wash your dress shirts every single\nday. If you're up in Victoria, up in Canada and\nyou're working outside only a couple hours a day and you're mostly in a controlled environment\nand you're sitting at a desk most of the time, you may find that you could take that shirt\noff at the end of the day and it's not really dirty at all and wear it two, maybe three\ndays over the period of a month and be fine with it. What I am saying though is try not to wash\nyour clothing unless it is truly dirty and it's going to last longer. So having said that, also avoid the dryer. The dryer is something that's going to destroy\nyour high-end dress shirts, so you should let them hang out to dry. Again, don't use the dryer. And if you have to use the dryer, pull them\nout while they're still moist. Avoid bleach. Bleach, that's cool for undershirts, that's\ncool for socks, but not for high-end dress shirts. It eats away at the cotton. Also avoid heat, so don't wash them in hot\nwater. You've probably heard that bleach and hot\nwater, that's going to help remove stains. Again, that's good for socks. That's not good for high-end dress shirts. Avoid overdoing it with detergent. Most detergents are pretty safe, but anything\nthat you put a whole -- and as guys, we like to think, \"Oh, well, this is a dirty shirt\nand if one scoop is good, then maybe five or six scoops is even better.\" Don't waste your money. It's better to wash it a couple of times with\nless detergent than to think that you could put in five scoops and get it all with one\ntime going through. Okay, so what do I use? Use a good detergent. I use Tide. I've used some lower end detergents and I\nfind that oftentimes, you often get what you pay for in detergent. A lot of people are going to say, \"Well, with\nTide, you're paying for the brand.\" Well, it's a small amount of money for the\namount of time that it takes me to go back and see that it missed a stain and have to\ngo back. Also, before you put your shirt in the wash,\nmake sure that you look for any stains. They have these spot sticks where you can\nactually go ahead and apply a little bit of detergent. I'll oftentimes take just a bit of detergent\nand rub it right in with a toothbrush. We've got a toothbrush down there in the laundry\nroom and I can just rub it right in and it will go in there and set for a few minutes\nbefore I throw it into the wash. I also use OxiClean and if you haven't heard\nof it, it's a great product. It basically augments any type of detergent\nyou're using. So if you're using a lower end detergent or\none that isn't really getting the job done, OxiClean will really go in there. Be careful with it and don't use too much. Use it on a dress shirt that does not bleed. If your dress shirt bleeds, you're going to\nfind that OxiClean may make that thing much lighter. It'll take a red shirt and it'll make it pink,\nso be careful with OxiClean. A dress shirt that is lighter colored, in\nmany cases, it helps a lot especially with anything around the collar. Now, when it comes to armpit stains if you\nget any type of yellow armpit stains, that's often caused by your deodorant. There's this stuff that's called Deo-Go and\nI know the guy that has a company here in the US, and this is specifically made to remove\nyellow armpit stains. I know the Art of Manliness just did an article\non yellow armpit stains and I wish they would've tested Deo-Go because Deo-Go, the best thing\nabout it is that the armpit stains do not come back. If you use OxiClean, occasionally the armpit\nstains do come back. I've also noticed this on other stains with\nOxiClean, is it will remove them, but I think it doesn\u2019t exactly fully remove the stain. It leaves some type of debris that can later\non take back to the coloring. This is specifically made for armpit stains. I haven't found anything out there that's\nspecifically made for a ring around the collar, but OxiClean does a great job of removing\nthat, and for just general washing, just a bit of Tide. By the way, you can use even less than they\nrecommend. I oftentimes only use half as much detergent\nas what they recommend. It really is a bit of an overkill I think\nfor most efficient washers today. That is how I clean dress shirts. By the way, I do not put them in the dryer. I let them hang out and then I will iron them\nlater. I have to iron actually my dress shirts when\nthey're a bit moist. I wish you guys the best of luck when you're\nwashing your clothes.

Bye-bye.", "94-oY_4DzjY": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey YouTube welcome back guys happy Tuesday anyway today I'm doing a video on is a pacing eight black t-shirt we got this yellow camel on the right hand side and then another one green camel I am doing this real versus replica or fake t-shirt so let's go ahead and get it started as you can see the one on the right hand side I'm not sure if you could tell or not it's the original one or ten tech and then the one on the left hand side this is a fake or replica one and this is the size medium on the right hand side and one on the left hand side says Asian size and it is in extra-large normally extra large if it's more like a medium size compared to the US okay so first of all let's go ahead and then focus on the ape face so I got a measuring tape right here I am going to measure for you vertically and then horizontally and size medium so the why on the face is about nine and one quarter to ten inches in between and if you measure vertically it's about fourteen and in half so the green one is about seven and a half to eight inch wide and then find the top two blood patterns about 11 and three-quarter inch and I'm gonna go through the picture real quick with the real one versus a fake one okay first of all you want to go ahead and then focus on the ape on the black one right here and right here so you can see the ape their face you can see the fur around the edges okay that's like a pointing fur or hair sticking out on their corner or outer layer of their face and so is that black one right there toward the bottom right here and also on this camo you see how it sharp edges around here and cut it right there a little bit and over here right here it's a shark and now we're gonna focus on this green one you see how the top ape shape or the head it is uh cut around everywhere there's no four sticky now around the face so even the one on the bottom right there it is so round two okay and then the shape right here is so round there's no sharp edges on the camo shape and also over here it's just round everywhere and then the registered trademark that one over there on the left hand side it is much smaller and you check on the on the are compared to the real one right there the R has this space in between the this lay right here and an 11 right legs okay and this one is a it's longer right here compared to the one on the left hand side the fake one the art the space in there is so small and then right here too so let's go ahead and then focus on the Ziploc fire real quick this one is a fake ziplock bag just by looking at a ziploc bag I don't see any difference except the bag is more like a frosty color or ice color so this is the front of the bag of the fake one I'm gonna show you the original one so this is the original bag the ziplock bag so around the face and then the nose is more like a more yellowish and then as you can see the bag it is more clear on the original one so with the original one you got this authentic sticker you show you the item number the color the size what apprising are there and then BALCO and this isn't print out anything on the back except there's a hole right here so the fake one has that I'm not sure if that's Japanese recycle or what is that and fake one they try to put the ball co in this then this size here let's focus on the label real quick guys just let say a bathing ape work on Matt 1993 - to 0-9 three and then extra-large and Ken want to come with this hangtag so as you can see the stitching is yes I sticky now or extra thread they didn't cut it and there's a focus on the Slee somehow they are double stitch it is supposed to have one line only and some of the one on this face is lighter brown as you see the is kind of messy on the stitching you know so nas was about that black threading across the white label and now here says a hundred percent cotton okay that's muqaam moving on to the already no one so this is the original one I know some of you gonna talk on my cell this is fake so whatever this is the original one authentic so you got a 1-2-3 labels and this is the tag that's on the sleeve as you can see the stitching is only one sticking out and then there is no black threading across it just a white threatening and then there's no tags inside the shirt okay sort of smooth em to the back all the media is like a side-by-side comparison on the tag of the ape face real quick let's go see on the left-hand side the fake one it is the face is more fatter and then the one on right hand side already know is more thin it's more darker on the right-hand side and this is what they look like on the back it is seen there on the right side and little bit longer or taller so let's go focus on the back so as you see right away the thick one is much smaller compared to the one on the right hand side I believe the size should be around the same so the one note left hand size about a inch wide and then the Tumnus about almost 12 inch and then one on the right hand side original one did run about nine three quarters to ten inch wide and if I'm talk to bottom is about fourteen inches and so you could look at the ape face again it is pretty drowned everywhere okay the top and then the bottom and as you see on this edges it's not sharp just that round and so is here and there there it's not supposed to be round like this and then some of the edges right here supposed to be sharp you see how the a face is the first mortifying okay everywhere I'm not sure you can see it and so is the one on the bottom so you see you guys see this first ticking it out and this is what I'm talking about like sharp edges and here and here and right here right there and right there so as you can see around their waist it is thicker on the or original one and this is a stitching for the fake one so as you see it shows a double stitching versus the original only got one oh I just saw something like so this is a pretty interesting because I'm left to dry this is like a one-piece fabric I don't see any stitching out here I'm here at all on the side along both ends that's kind of weird how they make this shirt in see there's no stitching how they join the fabric together versus the the fake one you see how they how about this join line when they put two fabric into one piece or they saw it interesting and this is the other side of it huh so as you see on this sleeve is too fabric but somehow I wonder how they make this shirt in the original one so on a sleeve it's like a they sew together press somehow anyway bye I better do some research on their how they how they saw this piece together because I'm trying to learn how they saw the shear together and then I just saw that I what's how they have a one-piece Fabray like that that's interesting and this is the color as a double stitching line right here what it joined together this is the fake one check on the color and then this is only one as you see there once this line and this is double stitching so anyway hopefully you guys liked this video guys and then please share this with your friends family on social media and drop in your

always peace out you", "_Z5kpF7aFEo": "[Music] hi guys it's Krystal welcome back to my channel today I have a really cool technique I'm gonna show you were gonna be sublimating on colored t-shirts you heard that right so we're gonna be sublimating right on these colored t-shirts place them I like to purchase my t-shirts from I'll have it linked down below I'm not affiliated with them at all for one they're super cheap number two I literally have them the next day I'll order them on a Thursday and have them on a Friday they're super fast I ordered these on Friday and had them on Monday this time I purchased the Gildan soft style these are 65% polyester and 35% cotton now you guys know I normally purchased the dry blend and they're 50/50 so I usually get the white ones and we sublimate on those because you can sublimate with at least 50% polyester but today I wanted to try it with a little bit of a higher count but it was sublimate these on the shirt and then we're gonna take them outside and spray em with bleach and you're gonna see a really cool trick happen all right so let's go ahead and get started today I'm gonna be using my 12 by 10 Cricut ez press cause it's going to cover these perfectly I ordered these designs off of Etsy and I'll also have these linked down below so let's go ahead and start with the Fermanagh first but he settings I'm doing for this today I'm doing 350 for 60 second because they are a blended shirt we don't want to scorch the shirt so I'm doing 350 for 60 seconds so we're gonna start with the FIR mama and we're gonna do it on this color here this is gonna be the 65% polyester now remember the higher the polyester count the better it's going to look so that's why I did this to show you because I already knew people are gonna ask about the 50/50 shirts so let's go ahead and get started I've got my heat press mat down the biggest one you can get I've got a piece of butcher paper here also I purchased my butcher paper by the roll from heat press nation I'll also have it linked below we're going to put down our shirt here in the inside of the shirt I'm just putting a piece of white cardstock just in case it bleeds through to the other side I'm just sliding that inside there making sure to go wherever the image is gonna go if you don't want to forget is to to do the lint rolling do not forget this and it's gonna be hard to tell with it being a co-ed shirt so I make sure and do the whole front side of the shirt that's just the way I do it to protect everything because you want to do a bigger area than the press so make sure you get your lint roll going on here you're gonna want to take a ruler and get this where it needs to go the ruler that I've been using recently is this cricket ruler here it's three by eighteen and it perfectly comes three inches down it has these gridlines here hopefully all can see this but it's got these lines here and I could figure out the center so the center of this is nine inches so I could come perfectly in the center of the shirt like this three inches down and now I can figure out where to place that so when I print out my images I try to get them nice and even on my paper here so that's what I've already done so we've got three inches down and now I'm just gonna make sure I get this exactly where I want it to be nice and even like I said I can actually see between these lines here just I'm gonna move our ruler out of the way our parchment paper on top this is going to protect our easy press and now we're ready to go 350 for 60 seconds light pressure keeping it completely steel you well move our butcher paper now if you see this right here that's just moisture and I actually should have pulled the moisture out of this shirt first so don't skip that step so you would actually want to preheat this we'll do it on the next one but this line will go away in a minute it's not gonna matter if in the end but that will go away so you want to go ahead and peel this up just like that so if you separate on a color t-shirt this is what its gonna look like it still looks super cute if you wanted to leave it like that once again this is gonna go away that's just pulling out the moisture this is what it would look like if you sublimate on colors that's gonna stay there it's not gonna wash out but that's what its gonna look like we're gonna take it a step further and we're gonna bleach this thing so let's go and press the next one get my shirt up here I'm gonna go and get my white piece of card stock in here the reason why you want white is that way the in case there's color ink inside the dye or anything it's not going to come out on the t-shirt or lint roller I'm gonna pre-press our area this time for about 15 seconds I'm gonna push that down I'm gonna go ahead and line up our ruler again a super cute image this is for a teacher the Apple is like it the Apple is a cactus how cute is that and then in the inside you could see some of the teacher stuff it's really cute all right so I'm gonna go ahead and get this as even as possible I've already got that on the paper here like I said so I know I can just kind of go on here and I'm actually gonna bring my paper up just a little bit cuz my designs down and get this even do with that cut my parchment paper on top 60 seconds all right so this is what it looks like so far right my sublimation image still looks really good so I can actually use this another round so I'm gonna set that aside see here it's super light it's really hard to see I mean you can see if there but I mean that's not a shirt you would want to sell or wear really I mean it's hard to tell it really seems a little bit better than what it is and it really is not when I bring it in this is what it looks like down here I mean it's not great but now let's go ahead and take them outside and spray some bleach on them and see the magic we're gonna take some regular Clorox it looks just like this just any kind you can use Walmart whatever burns you want to use so you're gonna take some bleach and I've already put it in some spray bottles these came from Walmart these are over in this section we're like your hair stuff and all that is travel stuff I filled up two that way if I run out I've got a backup and I'm gonna label these bleach so that way the kids didn't can't mess with them but you want to take some bleach and putting your spray bottles then you're gonna want to take a trash bag I'm gonna take our t-shirt so hear out my light you can see that our image here alright so we're gonna take our t-shirt here hopefully you guys can see I'm working on a piece of cement out here and I'm gonna take my t-shirt like this before you guys can see that and I'm gonna put my my my plastic bag up inside this is gonna protect the opposite side of the t-shirt so that way the other side don't bleach I'm gonna do the same thing to the next one so you can see here's that image out here at the light you guys can probably hear all the animals and critters out here so there is that image I'm gonna do the same thing put it I'm gonna put the trash bag inside is I take this is the end of the bag I put my two ends together like this take my t-shirt here open it up I put one over here in the on one side you can see out here I'll hold it and then go over to the other side hopefully you guys can tell what I'm doing and then you see in the middle there I'll grab the top shake it out and lay it flat okay so this is what we've got so far you can see the plastic bag coming out there a little bit so like I said there's the fur moment on this oh this is your lighter color and this is the darker this is 65 poly 35 cotton and this is 5050 50 poly 50 cotton you're gonna do take your spray bottle and we're just gonna spray this whole area so I'm going to kind of create like a square and then spritz some little uh I'm gonna spritz have few spots outside to kind of make it a little bit messy and worn down so like I said just taking my spray bottle here and like I said just gonna create me like a box so I'm just really coating that you guys can see that picking up a little bit and I may want to come down a little bit more on the shirt a little bit less to kind of give it like this faded look so now I've kind of got that soak in there all right so now I've got that one kind of soaking so we're gonna go and move on over to the next one I'm gonna do the same thing so I'm gonna create like a square going on here you can see that already starting to bleach through so as you can see I'm really really soak in the sublimation image I'll bring that in so you guys can see so you guys can see I'm really really soak in that sublimation image and then it's kind of working its way on the outside just roll lightly so I'm trying to create like a vintage effect so I'm just gonna kind of throw some spots out around so I'm just kind of getting some here on the end of this and swinging it so you can see if you when you splatter you kind of get like these effects here that's gonna kind of give you that see that already starting to take effect so you just let it stay here as long as you want until you get that effect you want and then throw it into the wash to stop that bleaching process what happens is sublimation does not leach it will not bleach out so the t-shirt is which is now gonna be white and you're gonna see that image really really well so how cool is that it really come through but for hers you can see how cute that is see how much better that image looks looks so good you can see this bottom part super cute but you can come down as low as you want to you can see that hers has like this splatter effect hopefully you can see that it's really neat so many possibilities that you can do with this you can see the sleeves are gonna be a little bit different with lines in them so if you kind of leave some wrinkles so this right here look how cool that is if you leave some wrinkles in the shirt like kind of have it up a little bit like this it's gonna create really cool effects like that see that image right through there now and so this one's gonna keep working as soon as it lightens up I'll bring you guys back over here and show you what it looks like hey okay my dog seriously man does he okay so I decided to go ahead and do one more this is that same image we did on the 50/50 this is the second time I'm using that same image I told you guys it was still bright and vibrant so I'm using it this is on that 6535 so we're gonna try it on this one here this is where we're at so far with the 50/50 my daughter already had to take the other one the other shirt inside because it needs to be washed out she's gonna go put it in the tub with cold water that way she could wait for these to be ready to go to put in the wash but you could see here how it's working as soon as that dries you're gonna see that same effect but I'm gonna let that keep doing its thing and I've already pulled out the trash bag and sprayed the back a little bit as well all right so this one here is gonna be that same image so I'm definitely recommending using at least that 6535 for this because they're coming out really nice so let's go ahead and spray this one but with this one I'm not putting the trash bag I'm making sure it's super flat for these wrinkles and stuff so I made sure it's super flat that way it'll have like the same type of effect on the back so it's Gordon get sorted another thing I've noticed was and I didn't realize if you unscrew this and you're gonna get more of a strain hopefully I can like shoot this here so you guys can see that you're gonna get more of that you know stream where I could go do something like this hopefully you guys can see that you guys can see where I'm getting more of like a blob so you guys can see that so I can kind of go through the shirt a little bit like this getting a few blobs hopefully you guys can see what I'm doing here try not to do spritzes I'm trying to slow down because if not you're gonna end up with streaks like that and really wanting like blobs like that so maybe pay attention and I'll streak it out like that so hopefully that don't look weird okay so now we're gonna do the same thing we're gonna go all the way around and cali the square but this time I'm gonna take it all the way down the front of the shirt like this kind of leaving that sides all right now I'm gonna go ahead and kind of let that do its thing and I think that's pretty good for me these shirts really don't take that much bleach like the 50-50 really took a lot maybe depending on the color too if I would have done something maybe if I'd have done something lighter but you could see how fast this one's coming through I'm not fast-forwarding or anything you could really see how fast this dudes working so it's working pretty quickly all right so see how I kind of came down and I've left the sides and it should go through the back like that and I did like these spotters on the sides there it's like I said I think that should be enough now you see how about images coming through super cool so I might put it in fast-forward motion to let you guys kind of watch this play out you it's kind of taking a peak real quick and seen with the back okay so it didn't go through the back too crazy I don't think it even went through the back because it's more of a light mist I don't even think it went through the back of this one it's really cute so it's got like this dark purple with this light or like pink tone going on here almost like an ombre effect if I want it to look just like this I would stop right here go get it in the washing machine now if I want it to get lighter I'll just let it continue to sit here and it's going to continue to lighten up so it's just however you want to so you leave it as little or as long as you want to depending on whatever effects if I was done with this I would go ahead and if you're not ready like you're making more shirts run it under cold water in your bathtub wring it out really really well and set it aside in the tub and finish getting all your shirts done and then throw them all in the wash at one time be here on the sleeve see where it's starting to get wider and wider here on the side you can see how much it's like they're not got some really cool spots but I'm really liking this well that's gonna look it's kind of like a light you can see where that bleach came through with just a little bit all right so I'm going to shut this down and get these in the wash and we'll meet you back at the craft room this is the one that we had done last so this is the second time I had used this image here and this is gonna be this is on the 65% poly it came out really really good so you can see how that came out look how cool these effects here are if you kind of get that spritz going on really cool so you can see it's just faded around like that this is what the backside looks like so it's still bright but it has like some splash through of the bleach like this has some and bring this up a little bit more so you've got like these spots like this and then you can see what's kind of darker here it's really cool this really cool effect and then this front so it's got this really cool vintage washed-out effect I really really love the way this one came out I'll have some nice pictures over on my Instagram so this is that first one that we had done with that fer mama I'm not too excited about the way that I had done the bleach I feel like I went way too far down and I left this piece right here because she's gonna tie this up a little bit so she's actually gonna do like this whole tied just like this so it's gonna be really really cute but I kind of wished I would have been a little bit more faced did did you look instead of so much right here but you can see if you put some wrinkles and stuff in here you can get some really cool effects so you can see how the arms came out here if you kind of wrinkle the arm zone you don't have them flat so that came out really really cool you can see inside the shirt to where the trash bag kind of got right up in here so you can kind of see how that looks the only thing about this one so we have that trash bag you can see what the trash bag came through here I didn't do anything on the back so this one's like a solid pink it's stay pink and I think I would want to wash out a little bit more so I think I'm gonna go back and add some bleach to this to give it a better effect but that's how that one is with the trash bag I kind of just recommend not even messing with the trash bag it's just more preference if you don't want anything on the back use the trash bag but if you like this washed out look then I recommend going with the trash bag you see how cool the back looks on this one it's got this really cool washed out effect and then on this one it's just really kind of I don't know I'm not too big of a I'm not too big of a fan of that so but this is using trash bag not using charge bag all right now for the 50 now I knew that you guys were gonna ask about the 50 50 so I went ahead and did the test but I do not recommend it so let me see if I can figure it out okay so this is the original color of the shirt there's still some right here and all it did was fade it out so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and bleach it one more time I'm gonna kind of get this area but I'm gonna wait until the morning time where it's really hot and I'm gonna try to really get this area and keep going over and over again but even at that that's way too much work I would not want to do that when these shirts are the exact same price I'm liking a lot I definitely like I'm a lot more they definitely give you that really washed out look they're super soft like I said they're 65 percent poly and you can see how good that image came out so it looks really really good and I could even have this one we didn't even bleach that much could have actually came in here and added more bleach and had more of a white effect like this one did but remember we left it so it's more of a lighter pinkish purple type of effect I really love the way this one came out so to me I don't recommend the 50/50 shirts because it's even if we do end up getting this to bleach down anymore it's just not like this image is gonna come through if we eventually got this to come through it would look like these but I just don't know how much bleach is gonna take and how many times I'm gonna have to do it so I'm gonna to continue testing and just to see if I can eventually get it to but if it's that much working like I said guys I just wouldn't even recommend messing with it that's just too much fuss for me when you could get these and these are like I think two dollars inside my shirt dollar something two dollars a shirt they're super affordable and like I said I have the link below of where I shop for these so I definitely recommend them number one they're super cheap and they come in really fast and they are the Gildan I'll have a link straight to them the Gildan soft style just remember whenever you look at the shirts you want to get the ones that are heathered so even though they'll be under the soft under the soft style you have to make sure they say Heather it's the heathered ones and I keep saying heathered but it has like this more you know look to them like this instead of like a solid so so there it is I hope you guys enjoyed this I hope you

lines on our wife today I'm going to show you how to fix that first pull out your lint filter next take out these two screws to get the lid open you pull back here and lift you take out screws here and here while holding the drum if you pull forward slide it out of the way underneath the drum is the motor and the idler pulley you need to lift up on the idler pulley and get the belt off the motor with this belt loose now we can simply pull the drum drum out of the washer you can see the problem is right here on this gasket that's where the stains are coming from just spray this with some household cleaner like 409 and wipe it clean all the way around now rinse it off really well you'll never get this color completely out of the gasket but you know you removed its staining ability when you go to dry it and nothing comes off on the napkin by the way you actually can buy new gaskets but I've always just cleaned mine and they've been just fine put the drum back usual drum in place while I put the belt on the motor below and I'm using a bar clamp like this you could use a piece of coat hanger wire in this hole and around here or just have someone hold it for you so you want to fold the belt and the loop under this pulley and then push up and hook it on the motor there are two little hooks on the bottom of the front panel hooks on here like this then push it forward into the drum little screws back in close your lid put these trees back in and slide in your lint filter while you have your dryer away from the wall it's a good idea to vacuum the mess up back here and more importantly make sure this vent pipe is open to the outside thanks for watching you", "GzK5C6R70J8": "hello you guys! welcome back to my\nchannel if you're new here it's so nice to meet you my name is Liz for today's\nvideo I'll be showing you ten different ways to tie a t-shirt I live in jeans a\nt-shirt or in the summertime more of like a t-shirt and some cut-off denim\nI'm just obsessed with tees I feel most confident and most comfortable it's my\ngo-to top I have a good amount of tees and I'm constantly circling through but\nsomething that I've always wanted to know different ways that I can tie them\nand tuck them so that way it doesn't look like I'm in the same outfit 24/7 so\nI'll be showing you ten ways today I hope you guys enjoyed this video as much\nas I enjoyed filming it and learning new different ways and different techniques\nso yes I love you guys so much and let's get into the video hello you guys\nwelcome to these styles I want to first apologize for my stuffy nose all right I\njust am wearing this simple basic white tee from H&M I have this bra underneath\nI wanted to show you guys just so you know what I'm working with here so for\nthis first look this is super easy I've been doing this one my whole life I\nthink we all kind of have I just tucked it right in the front you could tuck\nthis off to the side if you wanted you could tuck it in all the way around as\nwell oh my gosh just give you two extra styles hey this next one is the one that\nthis is the one that I do probably 24/7 this is the one that I do the most I\njust twist this and then I pull the end through and then you just have this knot\nright here I will say you can leave it with the little thing out but I just\nlike to take it and wrap it around so it kind of creates this little ball I call\nit like my Rose knot I don't know why I just reminds me of like a little rosebud\nso I love this one I wear this one all the time alright you guys for this next\none this one's super super easy it's just as cute it's just a little shorter\nthis is why I wanted to wear a bralette for this one because I feel like this\nwould be fun depending on the different colors you're wearing the type of top\nyou're wearing you just do the same thing but you do it higher and then you\nkind of tuck the knot underneath and then you can let your bra let show I\nthink it's super cute if you do this with like all black I've done that\nbefore it looks just sayin alright alright you guys this\nnext one is so freakin funny oh my gosh I'm like low-key embarrassed um but I'm\nleaving it in because this is the truth you know what I saw this photo on\nPinterest a few weeks ago of this girl's t-shirt where she crossed it and tucked\nit in at the bottom so kind of like a corset but the way she had done it it\nlooked perfect and so cute so I was like oh I'll try\nthat what is that girl you don't even want to know I I've tried this one so\nmany times you guys you know it just Oh Ellie\nhold on I'm recording um I'm gonna leave that in as well this is real life baby\nso if you know how to do this tell me because I honestly was struggling with\nthis I mean what is that look at it and now is where you can find my defeat and\nconfusion and I'm going to sit here and literally try to figure out how the hell\nthat girl did this because it makes no sense to me now this next one is super\neasy I've done this before you just kind of tuck in the sleeves oh my gosh now\nyou have like a tank top aren't these tank tops called something a man tank\ntop who cares I love it and then you just tuck it in\nthe side put on a cute belt with some cut-offs\noh my gosh hello summer do a low messy ponytail this is called he can't stop me\nnow heat not he I think I can't fully pronunciate pronunciate enunciate\nwhatever you got it anyways this next one I love this it's called do you have\nback sweat perfect do this tuck your shirt up into the back of your bra I\nalso saw a picture of this one Pinterest nose like this is freaking cute this is\nso easy so you just want to tuck in back your bra again I have a bra let on so I\nfelt like I was you know it looks kind of funny so you really take the time to\nmake it go across the back and kind of tuck so it looks more like a you in the\nback like upside down you tuck it around the front and then put a cute belt on\nwith this a girl you can really make this adorable\nare you kidding oh my gosh my butt looks good in this shot hello good American\njeans thank you this next one is so easy you guys I've done this before\nespecially if I have been like at the pool and then it gets too hot or\nsomething and I'm just like chilling in my clothes and you just take the sides\nyou twist them you tuck them underneath I'm trying\nmake sure that my bralette doesn't pick up the front cuz that's not what this\nvibe is for I will say you want to be careful at the back this happens to me\nalmost every time where the back is kind of down so you want to tuck that\nunderneath your bra as well so when you fully have this little crop it's so cute\nare you kidding look at me hi ABS hi jeans like hello everyone\nthis is who I am I love this one it's so pretty good for this next one you're\njust gonna take it and you're gonna make some little twisties I call these like\nmy little rose but like I said and I thought it was so cute to do the double\nyou can really take the time to manipulate the shirt and tie them closer\ntogether and you can do like to by each other in the front I always have a\ndifficulty with that if I'm honest but the ones on the side a thinker so cute I\nwill say if you want to use like a hair tie like a clear little rubber band one\nI would use that to kind of wrap around the I almost called them little buns but\naround the little knots because when I was tying this one under this boob I\nnoticed the other one undoes itself you will see that I'm keeping it real here\nyou guys and then I had to fix that one so just a little pro tip little leg pack\ngo ahead and I would just put a little rubber band on those so they say anyways\nisn't this so cute I love especially with the little bra lap you got this\nwould be extra cute if the shirt was bigger I feel like I should have done\nthese looks with a larger t-shirt but you know this is what I was working with\ntoday so we're just gonna work with it oh my gosh this one I saw this girl do a\nvideo where she tied her shirt around her belt loop in charity cute little\nbelt on and her whole outfit was cute look at me struggling I literally I'm\nleaving this in this is really I tried to do good I tried so many times I was\nlike who first of all why would I ever tie my shirt to my belt loop and second\nof all how but you know what the best part about this is and something you\nshould know about me you guys is I always persevere I always push through\nlook I made it I didn't y'all I made it happen and that's all that matters baby\nlook at oh my gosh there's nothing I can't do you know oh yes pose alright\nfor the final one today we're gonna take these sides and we're going to cross\nthem and you're going to kind of wrap like a pretzel just like tie them\nthrough like this perfectly and then you're just gonna tuck the ends in you\ntuck them in it looks so cute I love this little doo-dah I think it's\nadorable I think it's precious and I can't wait\nto do this two new shirts I just recently got a pink tea that I really\nwant to do this too cuz I think that'd be so cute with some gold jewelry are\nyou

today we are looking at outliers amb button up not a button down but button up and available not for 98 but for 198 on their website outlier dot nyc the fabric is a merino broadcloth from the albini group in italy which is a super respectable fabric house that makes a lot of high-end luxury fabrics for a lot of luxury high-end brands out there the climate control on this merino broadcloth is spectacular wool really is a great insulator and cooler is that the right word and with the sleeves and the thickness of this wool fabric you can really feel the thermal regulation like you know just yesterday i went from my office wearing this shirt to outside and i expected it to feel a lot colder but when i went outside it felt totally fine it was just so surprising how there wasn't much of a difference going from one climate to another whereas i think with outliers ultra fine merino tea the the climate control isn't really noticeable because the fabric is much thinner and it's a t-shirt doesn't have sleeves so it's really just only built for warm weather the fabric is a really really nice heavy weight so when you're wearing it it feels uh really present right like it's it's there it's it's weighing you down in a positive way like it's really solid and when you combine it with this spectacular drape that it has the end result is that you look really elegant and refined and luxurious when i wear it i get i notice that i get a lot of compliments you know especially for my family but that also might be because when i'm with my family i'm usually just wearing t-shirts and sweats and crocs and stuff but but one thing that i find really annoying is that they have this secret stash pocket it's annoying because every time i button up the shirt i have to button it through two layers of merino broadcloth fabric from the albini group in italy i also have no idea what i'm supposed to be stashing in there yeah they did an amazing job with this side panel so they they made this so that you can really raise your arms up high and the shirt won't drag up with you and you won't feel like you're restricted so you have a lot of shoulder mobility i think they made it for people who ride motorcycles so you can sort of lean forward and it feels mobile which i do not ride motorcycles the hand feel is really rich and deep it doesn't have that normal wool prickliness i mean if i really stop and notice and think about it i can kind of notice a bit of prickliness but it's not very pronounced whereas with outliers ultrafine merino tea i felt that prickliness a lot more than this shirt yeah the hand feel it has like a depth to it like a squishy thickness like it's very you know like like it's almost velvety it's it's in that direction of velvety velvety also has that kind of like smoothness to it and that doesn't really have it as much but velvety is squishy and i feel like that this fabric has that and i really like it quick plug for this channel me and my co-founder alan we own a clothing brand uh and every tuesday we upload a video onto this channel talking about clothing and culture and reviews so please consider giving a subscribe to see more of these videos you can also check out our subreddit r merit store or go to our website www.merit.store now in terms of fit i'm 511 160 and i normally wear medium and this is a medium i think it fits mostly true to size it might be just a touch on the larger side and the sleeves are a tad long but i think with this look i don't mind the fact that it's a larger size and i think for them they were very intentional about making it just a little bit roomier because of the drape and the weight and the way that they designed it and all of the thought they go into it when i wear it i feel really impressive and put together like the sleek and like the male version of chic and honestly because of the price i feel a little bit bougie just a little bit this is like a really really good shirt for you know dinners or dates or job interviews or meeting your girlfriend's parents or something it is a bit of a designer's shirt in that way the only thing is that the collar has fallen apart a little bit like there's not enough structure to keep it standing up on its own so it looks a little open and i don't really like that and honestly i'm a banded collar guy as of now so this traditional collar it feels a little old-fashioned at this point we also have a really nice banded collar shirt with a pretty lush hand feel and some stretch so if you're interested check out the link in the description or merit.store the brand is outline i've talked a lot about them on this channel i like how experimental they are and i like how they use fabric in very innovative ways but at the end of the day they're a luxury brand and they market themselves as a technical apparel brand but with the price point i mean it is it's a luxury brand it's 198 dollars for a shirt this is a luxury brand so you're going to pay a bit of a premium and you're not really going to feel like you got a good deal unless you're the kind of person who buys luxury and feels like you get a good deal and that's the case with this it's a good shirt i really like the shirt is it worth 198 if you're used to spending 200 on a shirt then i'm then i think adding this to your collection would be really good if you're not the kind of person who spends that much money on a shirt i'd pause i'd really think about it because it's not gonna feel like a good deal but if you believe in their mission of innovation and you really like what they're doing then when you buy it you're gonna love what you buy but if you're interested in wool and wool shirts and wool t-shirts but you want more bang from your buck i would suggest checking out unbound merino or woolen prints i'd say their stuff is right up there with outlier maybe some of their stuff could be improved a bit here and there but their value compared to outlier it's it's a lot better", "pxjGfgIC_eE": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] baby [Music] so [Music] no [Music] you", "1VUa99-tJqs": "[Music] [Music] [Music] Oh 17:5 st. color t-shirt mama

"hola muchachos welcome here this is seriously almost an embarrassing video to get without embarrassing it's just a little weird for today's video I'm going to show you different ways that I like to style my t-shirts it's a little weird so I've been doing this for the longest time now I love my basics and I love my t-shirts and even though I have a pretty good variety of other tops that I do like to wear and to sport there's something about a basic t-shirt that just feeds my soul so all of you guys asked me on Instagram and on YouTube and email they're like Sarah can you just show us a video how you do your shirts how do you tie up your shirts how do you tuck in your shirt and I was like really this just seems like a weird video to do but I kind of liked the idea of this video maybe that's why I'm filming it it's something very simple and basic but it can take your wardrobe and kind of turn it around and make it kind of cool take one piece do a lot with it that kind of idea so that kinda made me like maybe I will do this video and then I also thought a lot of people don't really know how to start with doing t-shirts and where this is where I'm not even wearing a t-shirt I can actually do a lot of things in this video with this shirt all the same so no usually not limit it to a t-shirt but this is kind of for that basic t-shirt but a lot of people don't really know how to tie it how tuck it and I thought this would be a great video that you can watch now and then maybe refer back to if you're looking for a different way to wear your shirt one day these are very basic please don't expect like me making like a peacock feather tail on the side of my shirt cuz I've actually seen that it's crazy this is just basic tucking in tying knots placement very simple but hopefully you still enjoy it I always wear high-rise jeans I just find it just it looks good I'm a shorter person it makes me look a little taller so I like to always wear high-rise jeans when I'm doing most of these outfits a high-rise maxi skirt or high-rise like pencil skirt usually when I tie it up and knotted up I don't want like skin exposed at least not like too much so some of these things I would actually wears more of like a very high waisted skirt but I wasn't gonna like change out a skirts and pants and stuff to film this videos I don't have time cuz I have three kids and they take up all my time so anyway long intro I'm sorry but I hope you guys liked this video and if you're new here be sure to subscribe and if you want see kinda just like more fashion ideas let me

like is my size but it's chunk a bit in the wash and it's made it a bit stiff and uncomfortable so how to stretch this out basically I'm going to walk it off now you need to keep your arms inside and sort of bounce them against the edge no you're not pulling it and you're not stretching it you just kind of bouncing them gently against the edge do the same for the neckline so like let you're clapping in an outward motion very sort of firmly but gently bouncing against the limits of the fabric in the arm holes and the elbow sort of area now same for the other sleeve either once more in the main body of the t-shirt and you can see while the t-shirt pretty much is the same size as it was earlier it's got a lot more flexibility to it it's not as stiff and there's more freedom of movement

families white clothes came out looking dirty well they had to fight to get some results that is until they turned to Ted [Music] Fred Moses just wants his white shirts white again if a white it turns brownish yellow color he bought two of these LG washer dryer sets for his house and a rental he owns and for about a year the washers worked without any issue but then rust getting into the wash flakes yep rust right there on the edges of the bleach container on top it spread all around that bleach container and as it spread Fred says the rust flaked into the tub and those flakes discolored the wash he caught him called the manufacturer but he says you always ended up on hole finally I said let me try ABC's Ted once our team got on the case Fred says something more than rust shook loose the company didn't call us back right away but Fred says a tech showed up at the house to make the fix it set the wheels in motion and they said we'll send out a tech and they too took care of one issue as it turns out Fred isn't alone unfortunately other customers seem to be having a similar issue in fact lawyers in New Jersey just filed what they hope will be a class-action lawsuit alleging LG defectively manufactured the metal tops of their machines such that they excessively rust within a short period of time it was just filed November 1st LG hasn't responded to it in court yet and Fred is not a part of the suit thank you for calling us oh thank you so much thank you very much oh gee by the way told us had no comment on the lawsuit as we said they filed nothing in court as for Fred they've taken care of one of his machines the company says they're working with him to take care of the second either fix it repair it give him a discount give him a refund but they will work with him and will follow up so you figured out it was a much bigger problem than just him yeah well and I think he knew that too as well Fred Moses did but yeah it's it is a bigger problem there are at least three people now that are on that lawsuit and then they hope they'll be a lot more well I love it Fred and Ted yeah glad we could help have a great Thanksgiving", "ZeRUL4GhNJQ": "welcome welcome welcome to downtown Los Angeles friends and family today we are gonna make a video on what is the best t-shirt for your breath alright guys now you probably know there's a ton of different t-shirt manufacturers that you can use to start creating your clothing line or if you're gonna create a peril for your company and some of the names that are out there that are super common or like alternative apparel we've got next level apparel american apparel Bella can versus comfort colors I mean there's like tons and tons of different brands out there that are making premium quality t-shirts and so if you're just getting started you're probably not thinking you're selling which one of these guys should I go with do I need to order a sample of every single one of them like what are some of the merits behind these guys so we want to make this video for you guys today we have made a video in the past about how to pick the best t-shirt for your brand that midi was maybe I put two years ago now so this one is an updated one fresh out yet for 2018 so in a pleats opinion and in our personal opinion we like the bella campus 3001 t-shirt as the best premium t-shirt on the market today and there's so many reasons why that is the case and I'm just gonna try to break it down for you in our opinions again every is entitled to their own opinions I know there's going to be some next level lovers out there I know there's gonna be some American Apparel lovers out there and that's okay everyone is entitled to their opinion and put those in the comments box well tell us all the reasons why you think we're wrong or you think we're right that's what YouTube is all about getting that dialogue going alright so the reason why Bella canvas is the best you can just start at the highest level Bella campus as a company they set out to make only premium quality t-shirts a lot of other apparel manufacturers and kind of set out to make a cost-effective t-shirt or to make a teacher but they don't come into it with the idea of like we're just making premium quality stuff and Bello canvas had that from the get-go that's the purpose behind the entire company so it's not a big surprise when they're making the best premium t-shirts 3001 style of t-shirt is the shirt I'm wearing right now throw out these bad boys on and show them to as well but they're basically just a standard short sleeve t-shirt they have a retail fit to them meaning there are a little bit more Eric t-shirts they come in a ton of different size options it's just like a fantastic platform if you're looking for a premium quality t-shirt and so from a size standpoint they go from extra small to the 4 XL they're unisex meaning that can be worn by a man or a woman the color options of that are incredible there's 95 different color options for the 3001 t-shirt so there's probably a color for just about anything that you're trying to do they're super super high quality construction but just in the shoulder seem like the inside seam around the neck goes from shoulder to shoulder they all have a tearaway tag so they're super easy to read you label if you're trying to put together a super polished brand picture for your customers [Music] so yeah the 3001 extremely soft t-shirt they use a special type of continent 32 singles when we talk about singles what we mean there's it's kind of like the equivalent of thread counts two sheets the higher the thread compass softer the sheet the higher the single the softer the t-shirt so industry standards around 30 but these guys have a 32 single shirt making it just that much softer that much smoother of a printing surface so you can get super super high quality prints off of ellis boat canvas 3001 the fit and the cut is super on point anyone who puts one on is gonna be a this thing fits really really well and then overall the stock picture they do a phenomenal job of having stock we did a video before about a tour in the warehouse they literally have millions of units on stock so if you're looking to get just a standard t-shirt that's always going to be in stock always be available bella canvas does not disappoint on the 3001 they're now getting into some super super detail they use a very particular type of cotton to build their premium quality shirts it's a 100 percent combed ring-spun cotton they even trademark that particular type of cotton make the cotton I use and it's heirloom and so that cotton is super super important to them they have the highest purity levels of their cotton they use extra-long cotton which obviously cotton is organic fiber needs to be grown and different manufacturers get their cotton spot from different people though is sourcing the premium of the premium quality I think the most important part about is we talked about those 95 different colors that they offer all of their diet is done with eco die and that means to super super important things first of all the dyeing process that uses non-harmful it's like they're dyes are not harmful dyes which is great depending on how and where you're getting some time but who knows what people use to dye their products with and then the other thing is Bella canvas is also super eco friendly company they recycle all their cotton scraps and their dyeing process uses 7 times less water they save millions of gallons of water every week in their manufacturing process so it's kind of like eco components like it's fundamental like in this day and age I shape the planet in knowing that you're using something it's eco responsible it's definitely two thumbs up it's a nice job on that one as well broad canvas and then another thing to think about in terms of like a t-shirt platform for your brand is the types of fabrication that are available within the 3001 style you have a hundred percent coffee bar I've spoken about that they also have a cotton poly blend which is 52 percent cotton and 48 percent poly and it's just saying it's a super soft shirt and you start to mix in some of those non-organic fibers you can't you just got like a really really nice plant the cotton polyblend tends to sit a little bit closer to the body and yeah really really supersoft on the blend and then they also have a prism line which is specific colors that are not like pastel colors and those are 99% cotton and 1% poly and then it's not that 3001 product but it's definitely worth talking about the describe blend it is basically the exact same cut as the 3001 but it is a tribe one fabrication it is a 50% cotton it's a 25% poly and 25% rayon and it is a 40 singles shirt the standard 3000 ones are 32 singles so you can imagine this is I can even softer shirt it's like there's premium quality shirt and then there's ultra premium and that tri-blend version it's not technically at three thousand one style it's three four one three style but it is the exact same cut and so wet that the three thousand one has it just has a different fabrication and they just grouped it under a different style but it is basically the exact same shirt alright guys so we will put these things on and we will model them for you it is your boy the Grebe's modeling I know I'm about five nine and I weigh I don't know like 150 pounds I'm usually right in between a medium and a large everything I've been wearing today is a large remember the bell campus has that fashion for fit it's a little bit more narrow cut so if you're riding between sizes and you like things a little baggy go big if you don't mind I took the tighter fitting go a size down so we another reason you love Bella canvas is we deal with a ton of customers making you know customizing the Bella canvas and we just never hear complaints if people are looking for premium garments we always recommend Bella and people are always happy with it so definitely recommend if you guys are looking for the Bella if you guys are looking for a premium t-shirt double canvas right now can you the capsule they're the go-to that is your boy boobies over and out from downtown Los Angeles I hope this video has take you guys time money anguish in terms of looking for that premium t-shirt for your brand [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]"}
